      "content": "Tried to load into a friends server by code and they put in an infinite loading screen. This first happened when trying to enter my friends server that we didnt touch for months and though of getting back into it. I couldn't load but I can still hear the environmental sound effects like the wind and leaves. Before this infinite loop of loading, I joined the game and my camera was at the spawn when we start the game and it was bobbing up and down constantly with no UI, I could not move but I can look around. I could take damage but I couldn't see my health going down since I had no UI. I can still load into my own server and everything is fine. My friend and I gave up on this old server and made a new one, I still couldn't join and was stuck in the infinite loop. Restarted my PC then I am able to play. Next time my friend opened the server I joined and it came back to the infinite loading screen. Truly early access. Anybody experiencing this issue? submitted by /u/Nuttyboiiii to r/Palworld [link] [comments]",
