Go for a sanctify. Affix replaced. Crit Damage turned into All Stats. https://i.imgur.com/RcFi4LS.png I originally wrote this post in anger. Today I am just sad. Sad that a game I was really enjoying now feels utterly pointless to play. Sad that I was finally talking my gaming buddies into joining to compete on the leaderboard. And now I don't even want to play. This is the second time an incredible item has been ruined this way. The second character that now feels dead. I took a 3 day break the first time. Now I just feel like: why bother playing? Players and content creators begged endlessly to remove temper bricking. When it finally happened, the game felt great and engagement BOOMED. Little did we know they slipped something worse in the back door: Now you brick your items after investing tons of resources into getting them to sanctification phase. Now you can actually make your items and your character WEAKER. Bad or useless sanctifications are fine. That's RNG. But ruining your gear, making it worse/weaker/useless is just terrible. I would literally be better off if I hadn't played Diablo at all yesterday. I logged in, played a few hours, and ultimately went backwards. That's a brutal, backbreaking feeling that isn't why I play ARPGs or games at all really. The dev behind \"Affix Replaced\" should be moved to the Overwatch team. This sucks and hurts bad. :/ submitted by /u/muckbeast to r/diablo4 [link] [comments]",

The game focuses on real-time colony management: digging tunnels, allocating workers, producing specialized castes, and reacting to a dynamic ecosystem (predators, resources, day–night cycle). Recently, I’ve added support for multiple players, allowing several colonies to exist and interact within the same world. If you’re curious, you can check out the Steam page here: https://store.steampowered.com/app/3016940/Garden_of_Ants/ Happy to hear any feedback or thoughts :) Best, Tomas submitted by /u/Able-Sherbert-4447 [link] [comments]",

You start focusing on the shadows and the isolation a lot more, and I hope that translates into the game's atmosphere. About the game: Ashen Seed (formerly Seedbearer – I had to rebrand to avoid legal issues!) is a hand-drawn Metroidvania focused on ecological horror. Think Hollow Knight's exploration mixed with the tragic scale of Attack on Titan. Key features: No contact damage: Combat is about spacing and patterns. Hand-Drawn animation: Frame-by-frame traditional animation. A dark, non-linear world: Set in a subterranean civilization destroyed by surface Titans. If you like the vibe, a Wishlist helps the algorithm immensely (and motivates me to keep going tonight!): Steam Page: https://store.steampowered.com/app/4200980/Ashen_Seed/ Thanks for the support! submitted by /u/castelvania4 [link] [comments]",

This clever usage of the environment and various props in it (and altitude difference between tiles) is a big component of how combat plays out in Happy Bastards, our up and coming tactical fantasy RPG set in an immoral world of monsters, heroes, bastards, and of course goblins (the kind that's corrupted by dark, malign forces). As far as combat goes, we wanted a tactical game where tactics are not just about outmaneuvering the enemy and positioning, but also setting traps for them and using what's at hand on the map to the best effect... like the kaboom shown here.

(at least we don't think he is lol) https://youtu.be/gnxnmw5ryhg?si=G-tIcc0f5gBV6MGv&t=379 (link to video above) the only issue in the video is he only briefly touches on the subject, shows part of the code and moves on. any information about how we can achieve this in unity (unity 6 preferred!),other resources we should look into, search keywords, mentorship, etc would be greatly appreciated! thank you! submitted by /u/Hot-Archer1650 [link] [comments]",

Has anyone else run into this or made it work correctly in this setup? I have been using the NavigationAgent2D on enemies with a Navigation Mesh and Navigation links. However, with gravity and physics, they seem to behave a bit weird when it comes time to jump at a NavigationLink2D. submitted by /u/IDoTheDrawing [link] [comments]",

Before that, one of the values I set through the editor was -450, but I also set other values afterward. But whenever I try to access the variable wall_jump_force it still returns -450 even when I explicitly set it to a different value. There is no reference to it anywhere else in the project and the previous export line has already been removed. Changing its name seems to work but I don't know why. If I only change the variable name and not its references it returns Identifier \"wall_jump_force\" not declared in the current scope. However, if I change both the variable and references names there is no error, so I don't think there is something setting it to -450. I also tried reopening the project and restarting my computer, but that didn't work. submitted by /u/Grouchy_Gap8097 [link] [comments]",

I have burned through this series in a Month and a half, and I got into Magic The Gathering only two weeks ago. But now that I have two new obsessions and the gimmick of book 6 is fresh in my mind, I cannot help but think how perfect DCC would be for a crossover into MTG. With so many Characters, Mobs, Items, and effects that are in the dungeon. The possibilities are so vast, and especially with how many more floors of the dungeon there are left. If they jump on this at the end of the series they could make a massive set list. The Creature cards are obvious you have so many Characters, and fun creatures that Matt Dinniman has come up with. Instants, and Sorcery’s could be pulled from skills the crawlers and mobs have. Or just funny shit in the book like a “Time to Pay The Daddy Tax - Destroy Target Creature” I don’t know. I’m not a game designer, you get what I’m saying. It would just be really cool to see. I can’t be the only one with both of these obsessions and hope that one day their paths cross. Hell it doesn’t have to be MTG put these guys in Fortnite! Truly I just want as much DCC as I can get. Inject it into my veins.

Now only a few branches still have the brown needles, which I believe was from the lack of light. it is currently in a south-facing window, and we are running a humidifier near it to counteract the woodstove. It seems much happier… Q: Should I prune out the last branches that still have brown needles or is it at a place where we should leave them be? A few branches are just tipped with brown, and a couple have brown needles closer to the trunk. (See pics) For the tips-only, could I just prune off JUST the brown tips without hurting it?

      "content": "Maybe this is obvious to others. But I come from a C++ background, so this wasn't intuitive to me. When running the game in the Godot IDE, you can modify your code on the fly! So, for example, if the code encounters an error and the debugger 'breaks' at that point, I can fix the error, and resume mid-gameplay. The new version of the function won't run immediately upon resuming, so hopefully the error wasn't totally game-breaking. After resuming, I can recreate the same scenario, and validate that my fix worked! Previously I would stop execution, fix the code, re-run, and re-create the error scenario. Realizing I don't have to restart execution is going to save me lots of time. So I wanted to spread the knowledge/joy, in case other people were unnecessarily restarting like me. submitted by /u/superyellows [link] [comments]",

I thought I could erase() the entry when the target dies, but it would still be problematic if target moves out of detection range. Ngl, as I'm writing this question right now in this very moment, I thought of a solution, but not sure. Instead of the weapon range creating an array, I could use the target itself detecting the weapon range and inserting itself into a dictionary, and if its not detecting the weapon range, it erases itself from the dictionary?

I have a couple of ideas. Some of them could be difficult to implement (no such animations in the vanilla game, hard to code, etc), and some of them are not really about traveling NPCs but more like POIs. Still, maybe something like this is possible? Some “NPCs Travel” events could technically be POIs and would mostly appear on habitable planets Scientists walking near their ship to scan flora/fauna, taking notes, and then flying away later People moving from one POI to another, or from a POI to their ship. Engineers, tourists, or miners with or without guards. A bounty hunter escorting a criminal in handcuffs etc Not traveling NPCs, but consequences instead.
