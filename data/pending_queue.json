      "content": "Yesterday’s massive Verizon outage left hundreds of thousands of users across the U.S. without cellular service for hours. A stark reminder of how brittle centralized networks can be. Phones went to “SOS” mode, people couldn’t make basic calls or use data, and some emergency communications were even affected before backup systems kicked in. It raises a bigger question: what happens when our critical infrastructure depends on a single provider or chokepoint? SkyMapper’s approach is different. By building a truly decentralized network using DePIN infrastructure, systems don’t have a single point of failure - they adapt, route around outages, and keep data flowing even when one part goes down. If we’re going to depend on data and connectivity, we need networks that are resilient by design. submitted by /u/noteasytobecheesy to r/SkyMapper [link] [comments]",

They pointed out: The game most likely stores which feather you've shot/\"taken\" down, regardless of how they respawn, and this game memory most likely reset once you've hit all of them. It then checks if you did it in the correct order, if not, no trigger. And this is precisely what I was wondering for the longest time. Shouldn't such game logic be relatively easy to find in the code? Why did none of the crazy Reddit RDR2 detectives find anything similar yet? Even before that, can we somehow infer from the code whether the spider webs or the feathers are triggers that change the game state in any way? submitted by /u/alasthennars to r/reddeadmysteries [link] [comments]",

Sad that a game I was really enjoying now feels utterly pointless to play. Sad that I was finally talking my gaming buddies into joining to compete on the leaderboard. And now I don't even want to play. This is the second time an incredible item has been ruined this way. The second character that now feels dead. I took a 3 day break the first time. Now I just feel like: why bother playing? Players and content creators begged endlessly to remove temper bricking. When it finally happened, the game felt great and engagement BOOMED. Little did we know they slipped something worse in the back door: Now you brick your items after investing tons of resources into getting them to sanctification phase. Now you can actually make your items and your character WEAKER. Bad or useless sanctifications are fine. That's RNG. But ruining your gear, making it worse/weaker/useless is just terrible. I would literally be better off if I hadn't played Diablo at all yesterday. I logged in, played a few hours, and ultimately went backwards. That's a brutal, backbreaking feeling that isn't why I play ARPGs or games at all really. The dev behind \"Affix Replaced\" should be moved to the Overwatch team.

Recently, I’ve added support for multiple players, allowing several colonies to exist and interact within the same world.

You start focusing on the shadows and the isolation a lot more, and I hope that translates into the game's atmosphere. About the game: Ashen Seed (formerly Seedbearer – I had to rebrand to avoid legal issues!) is a hand-drawn Metroidvania focused on ecological horror. Think Hollow Knight's exploration mixed with the tragic scale of Attack on Titan. Key features: No contact damage: Combat is about spacing and patterns. Hand-Drawn animation: Frame-by-frame traditional animation. A dark, non-linear world: Set in a subterranean civilization destroyed by surface Titans.

As far as combat goes, we wanted a tactical game where tactics are not just about outmaneuvering the enemy and positioning, but also setting traps for them and using what's at hand on the map to the best effect... like the kaboom shown here.

Has anyone else run into this or made it work correctly in this setup? I have been using the NavigationAgent2D on enemies with a Navigation Mesh and Navigation links.

Before that, one of the values I set through the editor was -450, but I also set other values afterward. But whenever I try to access the variable wall_jump_force it still returns -450 even when I explicitly set it to a different value. There is no reference to it anywhere else in the project and the previous export line has already been removed. Changing its name seems to work but I don't know why. If I only change the variable name and not its references it returns Identifier \"wall_jump_force\" not declared in the current scope. However, if I change both the variable and references names there is no error, so I don't think there is something setting it to -450. I also tried reopening the project and restarting my computer, but that didn't work. submitted by /u/Grouchy_Gap8097 [link] [comments]",

I have burned through this series in a Month and a half, and I got into Magic The Gathering only two weeks ago. But now that I have two new obsessions and the gimmick of book 6 is fresh in my mind, I cannot help but think how perfect DCC would be for a crossover into MTG. With so many Characters, Mobs, Items, and effects that are in the dungeon. The possibilities are so vast, and especially with how many more floors of the dungeon there are left. If they jump on this at the end of the series they could make a massive set list. The Creature cards are obvious you have so many Characters, and fun creatures that Matt Dinniman has come up with. Instants, and Sorcery’s could be pulled from skills the crawlers and mobs have. Or just funny shit in the book like a “Time to Pay The Daddy Tax - Destroy Target Creature” I don’t know. I’m not a game designer, you get what I’m saying. It would just be really cool to see. I can’t be the only one with both of these obsessions and hope that one day their paths cross. Hell it doesn’t have to be MTG put these guys in Fortnite! Truly I just want as much DCC as I can get. Inject it into my veins.
