      "content": "Most people think censorship looks like deletion. It doesn’t anymore. The most effective way to erase history is not to remove content, but to make it slightly inconvenient to keep. Over the past few years, platforms have quietly removed or degraded basic archival functions: saving videos to your device, exporting files, recording screens cleanly. Nothing is outright forbidden. It’s just… annoying. One extra step. A disabled button. A warning. A quality loss. A watermark. That single layer of friction is enough. Behaviorally, even a small obstacle reduces follow through by orders of magnitude. People defer. They assume someone else will save it. They assume it will still be there later. They move on. At scale, this produces a bystander effect applied to information: everyone witnesses, no one preserves. The result is a form of soft historical erasure. Content technically exists, but only ephemerally, inside feeds optimized for forgetting. Without easy saving, there is no personal archive. Without personal archives, there is no collective record. Without records, patterns can’t be proven, reversals can’t be compared, and narratives can’t be held accountable over time. This is not an accident of bad UX. Platforms know exactly how powerful friction is. If they wanted people to preserve content, they would make it effortless. Instead, they’ve made preservation socially and cognitively expensive while keeping consumption frictionless. It’s important to be precise here: this isn’t about any single video or ideology. It’s about temporal control. A society that cannot easily keep records is trapped in the present tense. Always reacting, never contextualizing. History doesn’t disappear because it’s deleted. It disappears because everyone assumes someone else saved it. And that assumption is being engineered. submitted by /u/Key-Lawfulness-4885 to r/conspiracy [link] [comments]",

My suggestion is to mildy buff the conquering aspects of these, late game becoming rebellious, colonies, by just singificantly reducing or removing AE of conquring them. Then you'd still have to pay for the singificant integration cost but at least you don't get kneecapped of never being to absorb these provinces ever if you'd like to care about coalitions or AE late game (otherwise the game just ends up as a conquest simulator to go all in and war the coalitions to the end if you'd like to annex vast colonies, like i now mistakenly covered all of russia with.) submitted by /u/HampeMannen to r/EU5 [link] [comments]",

Why does it only grey out filtered prices instead of simply not showing them? It has all these great filters but is clearly designed to frustrate you as well. This game follows in the footsteps of path of exile, so I can only guess this is friction by design. But damn there has to be a better way and path of exile has already shown that to be true. Have the devs actually given their view on this before? Improving this aspect alone would drastically increase my enjoyment of the game. submitted by /u/Timmay4798 to r/TorchlightInfinite [link] [comments]",

For example, I should have made the pekka lock on the Monk, placed the princess in such a way that she would kill the musk or dart gob, similar thing for exe and all that. I am currently at ~2650 trophies and would want some suggestions. I don't really have that much of a hefty goal, just want to finish top 10k. Open to all kind of suggestions. To be honest I don't even know if it is worth thinking that much about this and the full superstar was just supposed to win.

      "content": "When I first thought about making a multiplayer incremental game, I already had this community in mind as an example of how friendly and healthy the incremental games scene can be. And honestly, that’s been proven every day on the game’s Discord. From day one, everyone who joined has been super helpful, reporting bugs, helping new players, and just being really nice overall. Some of you even turned into actual friends that I’m so happy to have met. This has been one of the coolest parts of working on this game so far. The support has been amazing, and the best way I can give back is by putting all my effort into making the game better every day. If you haven’t played BIRB already, this is a great time to do so! The game just received a big update, adding tutorials and making everything more clear for someone new starting :) Birb is a multiplayer game that you can play solo too, meet new people, create custom rooms for your friends to play in, and most importantly: completely FREE! You can play it on itch: Birb submitted by /u/Slow_Homework_2224 to r/incremental_games [link] [comments]",

Instead, when you select something, the UI appears around the entity itself - buttons and info stay close to what you're interacting with, so your eyes never leave the game world. In many occasions I literally forget I have an UI view open because it's not distracting to me. I've added a few screenshots showing different interactions in action. Curious how this feels to you. Is it intuitive or distracting? How does it compare to classic pop-up menus? All of these work perfectly well with directional controller inputs btw.

      "content": "(spoilers for Monster and Code Geass) Lelouch is placed in the world of Monster and is tasked to solve the mysterious murders. For Lelouch to win, he must figure out that Johan Liebert is the killer, find evidence to convict him, and have him arrested. Otherwise if Johan gets away with it or kills Lelouch, it's game over. For this rundown, Lelouch won't be allowed any help from the black knights, use any tech from his own world, or use his geass as he must solely rely on his skills and intelligence. It's also worth noting that Monster takes place in the 1990s so its technology is more primitive compared to Code Geass, making it harder for Lelouch to capture him. One advantage Lelouch would have is that he's already used to working in the shadows as Zero so he wouldn't reveal himself to the public while Johan wouldn't know much of Lelouch's background to successfully manipulate him. What makes Johan different however is that unlike Lelouch's enemies, Johan doesn't have pride or desire power. Instead, Johan tricks others into believing he doesn't exist. He's also known to change his methods and motives at the drop of a hat which is why he's so hard to capture. Johan once tricked a man into committing suicide and an entire townsfolk into killing each other, and he made all these unsolvable murders without even needing any special powers. Lelouch would be assuming a similar role to Detective Lunge, and Lunge only suspected Dr. Tenma of being the killer and didn't think Johan was real because Johan was that good at manipulating people. Lelouch would suspect Tenma at first, but after a few days of investigating him, he'd conclude that Tenma's innocent since Lelouch is already used to dealing with manipulators and would unlikely fall for Johan's tricks. The biggest difference between the 2 is that Johan is a serial killer while Lelouch is a war strategist. Lelouch defeated Mao, who can read minds, and prerecorded his conversation with Schneizel, meaning he was able to predict not only his responses but also his timing. Lelouch even disarmed a bomb that was far more complicated than anything Johan set up. And even though Lelouch won't be allowed to use his geass, he's already experienced supernatural elements which completely throw any logic out the window, so whatever tricks Johan would throw at him would be nothing compared to what he's already been through. Based on all these feats, I personally think that for Lelouch, it'd be difficult but not impossible for him to capture Johan.

      "content": "After finishing Trine 5, I’m left wondering why the puzzle solutions felt less inventive than the series’ reputation suggests. Take the ‘Magic Forest’ level in Trine 4—I’ve heard players rave about how the wizard’s levitation and thief’s grapple combo created mind-bending solutions. But in Trine 5, many puzzles boiled down to trial-and-error plank placement, which felt more like brute-force than clever design. Here’s what I’m curious about: How does Trine 5’s puzzle complexity compare to earlier entries? Are there standout levels that break the ‘plank spam’ trend? What mechanics from Trine 2/3/4 should have carried over to avoid this issue? As a newcomer to the series, where should I start to experience its peak creativity? I’d love to hear from veterans—what moments in the series made you say ‘That’s a Trine moment!’? submitted by /u/Suyio12 [link] [comments]",

The screenshot does not do it justice, about 60% of the area around me was COVERED in iron and copper nodes with an almost-platform jutting out of the center. Even found a few Thorium spawns around the corner. Thankfully I have the Lucky Mining and Magnet mods, so I walked out with ( only ) 8 Thorium, 157 copper and 120 iron ore. This is what I loved about Minecraft. Just randomly spelunking and stumbling into enough resources to keep me crafting for hours. Once we get some content mods and systems added in, this game could keep me occupied for months on end. I am glad I was 100% wrong about how this would launch. There was also a veeeeeeeery large drop into a HUGE lava cistern, but I'mma save that for later when my backpack isn't so hefty. submitted by /u/randomidgit to r/hytale [link] [comments]",

The player controller script is also given below. Note that this is not the final script from the video as the final script behaves more or less as intended as far as I can tell. But there is a point in the video at about 9:30 where he does an attack and then it hangs on the last frame of the attack because the upper and lower are not synced at all, hence the content of the _ready function in the code block. But when I copy his code and the animation setup exactly (at least as far as I can tell), I get the looping behavior that I talked about earlier.

      "content": "Hi everyone I am having strange std::find_if behavior with my C++ program. It is going to be hard to describe without pictures. So basically I am making a card game and I have sorted this array of cards called my_FU_sorted (size 3). Now every card has a rank and a suit and if a card is considered to be out of play, I give it a rank of 13. Now I run this code: int first_playable_index = std::find_if(my_FU_sorted.begin(), my_FU_sorted.end(), (const Card& c) {return c.playable(p);}) - my_FU_sorted.begin(). p stands for the pile of cards and its basically saying \"In this sorted hand of cards my_FU_sorted, give me the first index where that card is playable\". I have made cards with rank == 13 unplayable. Ok. Thats the first part. Now when I run the program the first time, my_FU_sorted is made of 3 cards and is {Card1(rank =13), Card2(rank == 5), Card3(rank == 8)} yet somehow it returns first_playable_index as 0. But then on the second run my_FU_sorted is now {Card1(rank =13), Card2(rank ==5), Card3(rank==8)} yet somehow some miracle first_playable_index is now 1, rather than 0 the first time. I am really at a loss for words. It makes no sense. Especially when I run in GDB my_FU_sorted[0].playable(p) for both times, and they both say false, so it should've not been possible for first_playable_index to be 0 the first time. submitted by /u/johnnyb2001 to r/cpp_questions [link] [comments]",

Had 21 Points and did not score in the 3rd qtr but covered in the 4th qtr! Damn Donovan. Cost me a chalky lay. Facilitating most of the game. I guess it makes sense when Garland is out. He nearly had a trip dub NGL I didn't like this lay but came close.. Egor really didn't score after scoring 5 points and of course got hooked! This was a nice lay! Another nice lay that I laddered! This was my chalky lay that came thru! Initially had 5+ Asts on Tre Jones but I thought different because he's starting and only to find out that Billy Donovan benched Tre Jones for Jalen Smith to start the 2nd half. He cost me this lay and of course I got hooked!!!! Got hooked on Nathan MacKinnon. He recorded 1 Point and fell short from hitting this lay! ANother hook!! Igor hooked me twice today and in two different lays Lmfao. One lay for 6 pts and this one for 1 three pointers https://preview.redd.it/uuw4tsguxudg1.png?width=996&format=png&auto=webp&s=1ec390773440a085e6e4bba9e171e891b52383dc Yea, I was big on tre jones.

      "content": "To the people that throw temper tantrums in this game: If someone’s emote spamming on your body or saying thanks, just play along. You beat them next round/fight? Then you emote spam them. That’s classic For Honor. There’s no need to freak out and attempt to throw the match or rage quit. It’s not personal, ever. These people don’t know you, and you don’t know them. So just play the “toxicity game” and laugh at it. It’s hilarious seeing a hero spazz out after they’ve beaten you, and feels great to do the same back to them. If you take it personally, you’re no longer having a good time. You’re angrily mashing your keyboard/controller trying to prove something to someone you’ll never know. The toxicity is normal, but not having a good time on a game you play every day isn’t. TAKE A BREAK, and then come back to the game with a mindset of wanting to have a good time. As weird as it sounds, toxicity in For Honor is not the same as toxicity in other games. It’s woven into the game itself, and for most people, it’s all in good fun. Not everyone that spams has a “fragile ego” or is a bad person. They’re laughing at it, win or lose. You, though, are gritting your teeth and raging. Which just makes it even more funny for them. When you actually get mad, all you’re doing is choosing to not have fun in a VIDEO GAME. So see it as it is, a game, and have fun. That’s all, best wishes to everyone submitted by /u/FeachEE to r/ForHonorRants [link] [comments]",

      "content": "I want to preface this by saying I love YGO. Have since I was young. I’m not a competitive player by any means but I always really enjoyed the back and forths in the anime and dueling friends when I was younger. When Master Duel came out I was thrilled that there was an official sim for the game and got back into it after years. Few years in now and I’ve noticed a pattern. More often than not, people are running decks that love to go first and sets up a board that has multiple negates or floodgates, etc. I’m not mad they exist, they’re part of the game. But why, in the name of the Pharaoh, are they SO DAMN POPULAR. I understand that there are people who are so obsessed with winning that they want to play floodgates and negate boards, but what is so fun about these decks that EVERYONE seems to play them? What is fun about NOT LETTING THE OPPOSING PLAYER PLAY THE GAME? It feels like the equivalent of playing chess as white, making your opening move, and then flipping the board and declaring victory before your opponent can make a single move. Why is this play style SO common? It feels like EVERY. SINGLE. DUEL. It’s to the point where genuinely if I go second and I don’t have any hand traps or a hand with 5 starters it feels like I should be scooping to not waste my time. Even in casual, it’s the exact same. Especially because MD for whatever reason is allergic to best of 3 format so you can’t even adjust to play around a lockdown. I know the play style exists and I know people who just want to win will use it but when did that become seemingly the ENTIRE player base? It’s mad frustrating that I just want to play the game but I rarely ever can because I get hit with every floodgate or negate possible before I even have a chance to play a card. What happened? Genuinely baffling as I don’t see how it’s fun for anyone, especially given that a lot of these decks play the exact same combo every time to get the lockdown. No variety, no change, same combo to prevent your opponent from playing. The same community who hated Mystic Mine with a fiery passion for stopping gameplay seems to be doing everything in their power to replicate it. submitted by /u/Professional-Gas1682 to r/masterduel [link] [comments]",

Kiwi’s not giving themselves time to be in the correct lane to turn at junctions and instead doing it at the last minute putting other drivers at risk. The only time when I witnessed safe driving in new Zealand was from a random Indian couple who slowed and stopped to let pedestrians cross the road after a concert. I’ve traveled almost everywhere in Europe, Italians are crazy chaotic drivers but at least they all suddenly stop when any pedestrians begin to cross the road without any need for traffic lights.

I did three tests, each comprising of 100000 particles affected by gravity How I would normally write the code as OOP, do everything in the class As an Array of Structures (AoS). Which is similar to 1 except the class is now just the data, the logic is in the manager As a Structure of Arrays (SoA). Which in this case is parallel arrays which have synchronised indexes. The code for the tests is here I ran the tests, one after another, 4 times each. I let each script settle in for a little bit, then at a random time took a snapshot of the times in ms per frame for running _physics_process. I'm not a scientist but I thought the results were telling enough.

I'm unsure if it's fixed in 501 or not as I'm still in 401 oxygenos16, I'm also unsure if it's an issue with Chinese device being flashed with oxygenos, but I'm pretty sure that the device is too overkill to actually have that low fps drops to even 90 when it wants. submitted by /u/FyBornEX to r/TheOnePlus15 [link] [comments]",

Things started off great where he basically revolved around me when possible while being able to live our lives. When I got kicked out at 18 I had to move in with his family for a year until my mom could afford an apartment for me and her. Living with him wasn't enjoyable sometimes, he'd ignore me for his games, be rude, and didn't exactly respect my space in our room, I kept my stuff in a corner and he kept throwing his stuff over and in my walkspace. He even would leave me alone without anything to do for hours on end as I cried because he wanted to hang out with his friends who didn't want me included, especially one friend who hated me(I had fucked up and hurt him in the past but we worked through it). I had gone to a mental hospital after maybe 2 months as I just couldn't handle how life was going. I'd pay his bills and help support him through schooling so he could get a good paying job he enjoyed. Now I'm living with my mom and he stays with us, I work minimum wage and make more than my mom, we struggle to pay rent. Whenever I try to ask my fiance for help he seems to act like its such an issue to help pay for a place he basically lives at, he showers the longest, eats the most, does his laundry, etc etc. Now he has even started to basically refuse to pick me up from work because he would rather play MTG at card shops than get me. I feel unimportant, I feel like shit, and I don't feel like he cares. What do I even do? What happens if I just move to Texas from the PNW? What can I do? I'm just lost and need help Tldr: my fiance would rather prioritize friends and mtg over me and I don't know what to do submitted by /u/Uniquegrlygamer to r/relationships [link] [comments]",

I can speak english if needed but as a non-native I think I can't \"teach it\" hence I would like to emphasize my offer to help with french. As for me, I'm a 24 years old man from France that love to learn languages, maybe a little too much because I tend to take too much load at once on that subject but I love it. If you care about my others hobbies, I love Formula 1 with all my heart. I love doing sports, which include mostly running, badminton, tennis, hiking and climbing, staying healthy in general is a subject I like. I used to read a lot of fantasy, although way less nowadays. I like coding and making new engineering projects in general as it's the field i'm currently studying in. I also play a lot of chess and some videos games. I think that's most of what I do but I'm open to talk about anything because it's precisely what I like, to talk about something, a country or whatever I don't know well ! As for you just be truly willing to learn. I usually have free time during weekends but during weekdays it's harder for me to be active. I don't require a lot of activity but the only thing I'm asking is for you to be willing to find subjects to talk on. Because usually on here I try to give subjects to talk about but I'm meet with a dry \"yes/no\" response which isn't ideal for practice. Otherwise I'm open to anyone ! Have a nice day !

      "content": "We often see \"movie adaptations\" and that phrase has become a meme, because movies made by Hollywood radically alter the look and feel of a franchise until it becomes unrecognizable. The best \"movie adaptation\" anyone could do should be a 2 hour cinematic for a game. No need to \"reimagine\" with a \"director's vision\". This bad habit of Hollywood is more about ego pleasing of the makers of the movie, than actually selling a franchise to newcomers. They did a great job with Arcane. Arcane is a 6 hour game cinematic. No need to \"adapt\" anything. Game cinematics are already a movie. Just make the game cinematic long enough. After seeing the great work in Mechwarrior 5 Clans cinematics, and how cool the story is, and its look and feel, that is exactly the look and feel that a Battletech movie needs. Just make a 2 hour game cinematic telling a story, made by the same people who made the game cinematics, and voila, you have the best Battletech movie possible. This is my proposed formula for a cult Battletech movie or show. If anyone has a better I dea, I am open to change my mind. submitted by /u/JoseLunaArts to r/battletech [link] [comments]",

It would also be a great way to farm money too because i believe that dungeons should give a lot of money depending on the difficulty, for example give 20k money, meduim40k, hard 60k and nightmare 80k money i think it would make grinding for money much more easier, they could also add new boss drops within these dungeons that would have good passive when it comes to forging because i'm kinda getting bored with mine this, then get this pickaxe and mine this it would make progressing seem much more fun and what do you guys think about this idea and feel free to leave your opinions about this. submitted by /u/Ok-Perception-4275 to r/TheForgeRoblox [link] [comments]",
