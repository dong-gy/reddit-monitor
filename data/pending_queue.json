The teacher admitted we might burn through his curriculum because games and exercises take so little time to get through, but we’ll all get to know each other better, and it feels more like a team than a class.

I thought I could erase() the entry when the target dies, but it would still be problematic if target moves out of detection range. Ngl, as I'm writing this question right now in this very moment, I thought of a solution, but not sure. Instead of the weapon range creating an array, I could use the target itself detecting the weapon range and inserting itself into a dictionary, and if its not detecting the weapon range, it erases itself from the dictionary? Thoughts? Thanks for any light. submitted by /u/h3iberg [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Hi devs! I'd really like to ask for your advice on idea and sketch of capsule for my game. I'm making a game, a roguelite zombie-shooter with pixel-art aesthetic. In this game, you need to run along roads, destroying zombies along the way. Survive zombie ambushes, open chests with resources, and find and upgrade your weapons. I'm thinking of capturing the core essence of my game in a capsule: the player is at a crossroads because the game has a choice of paths/roads (and it's a roguelite); one of the roads has zombies on it because you are fighting zombies; the second road shows reward chests as there is loot/rewards in the game; the dark, ruined city in the background is due to the overall dark, post-apocalyptic feel of the game. Is this a viable idea? Will such a capsule be visually appealing? This is a very rough sketch, so it looks very basic and downright unattractive. But I wondered if this would really work, or if I needed to look for inspiration elsewhere. On the second page here, you can also see the entire sketch.

Any information would be appreciated! submitted by /u/irreal_xol to r/psx [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Just had my first day subbing outside of where I student taught and then subbed for a year, so went into the inner city with no rapport - you know how it is. Realized I need to do some reflection and be better prepared for HS. I felt like half the students were trying to pull one over on me at any given time. I'm someone who gets hung up on logistics, how would you have handled the following? student in coding class showed me they had all their work done then proceeded to play call of duty (a game involving guns) and had their headphones on in a call with a friend who was playing the game with them. he was very quiet. students were supposed to have their phones in the pocket at the front of the room. everytime i so much as glanced his way he was all 'what? what do you want?'. I did end up handling it but what would you have done? this school has a turn your phone in at the start of class policy, they come in and see me and immediately decide to keep their phone and try to be sneaky. would you enforce this? i gave multiple reminders and commented on the number of phones vs people and managed to egg a few students into putting their phones in each grade but definitely not most. students were constantly asking to leave the room for a million reasons. i was ready for the bathroom - one at a time, have one pass that gets returned. then students started asking to go to the counselor, the SED, get something from their last class they forgot and i got overwhelmed. i would write down the time a kid left and did end up having a kid i had to call the office on for disappearing for 20 minutes and they found him and sent him back. what do you do? next time i plan to have a sign out sheet with time and have them write their name and verify with the roster and tell them the time i expect them back or i'll call the office. if students get their work done, how far do you let things go? sitting on desks chatting, phones out, etc? how far do you let it go?

They were insisting that rogue HAS ALWAYS BEEN vanguard coded in the comics. 🤦🏻‍♂️ it got me thinking if Rivals players actually read marvel comics or even watch the cartoons growing up? well i did. ROGUE in her VERY CORE is not vanguard coded. she only had super strength and stamina ONLY AFTER she copied/absorbed Ms.Marvel and then it became semi-permanent as a side effect. but rogue as a mutant, AS ORIGINALLY DESIGNED . her powers IS NEVER MEANT to be vanguard coded. Rogue's origin powers is power and memory absorption by touch THAT'S IT. just because vanguards absorbs damage doesn't mean rogue's power of absorption is the same! if you watch x-men animation/cartoon or have read the comics YOU WOULD KNOW THIS. now this isn't about how rogue CANT be a vanguard, SHE CAN . im just stating the fact about the origins of her powers and what she TRULY is, in her very core as a mutant and how just because things seems obvious, doesn't mean it will translate the same way in the game.

So I grind casual. Often enough my teammate wants to ff, sometimes its like 50 seconds into the match because the score went from 2-1 to 2-2. I feel like if I ff I'm wasting time, I'm not gonna get better 1/5th of a game at a time, and I learn less if I only play the winning games to completion. Some games I end up in a lobby where everyone is a full rank higher than me (according to bakkes). These games are usually a blowout but there's a lot to learn. I don't want to forfeit but I feel kind of like a jerk for dragging my teammate through a losing game. And if I don't forfeit they start throwing, trash-talking, owngoaling etc. What would you guys do? Play through at the expense of your teammate?

      "content": "I am planning to make a turn based RPG game in unity, but the problem is i have not used unity(or any game engine) . The problem that i have encountered is that of how do i \"attack\", the thing is I already made the game in VS(C#) in console and it worked perfectly and my battle logic was: You have a maximum of 5 characters and the enemy also, for each turn i make a array of all the characters(enemy + player) and i sort it descending according to the \"initiative\" and according to this array is the \"turn order\" and when technicaly is your turn you just write 1,2,3,4,5 to select the ability then 1-5 to select the target. So back to unity, i thought that was done in \"update\" in my battleHandle-monobehaviour but did some research and also asked chat and came with the same answer : i need to make the buttons and on press to check the condition if i can attack(the condition is intuitive) BUT when the enemy attack it is done in update. Why is that, do I miss something ? Is this \"button\" that i can always press(but will not do anything if the \"state\" is not my turn) the way to go or to check in each frame ( in update) if the player had a input(if the state is player turn ofc, cuz i have 2 ifs \"if state==playerturn or if state==enemyturn) I am lost all help will be useful! submitted by /u/LunchLeast809 [link] [comments]",

      "content": "I broke up with my boyfriend 151 days ago. It was not a healthy relationship for both of us and he treated me poorly however I wasn’t much better than he was — although I personally feel he was significantly worse. Since then, I hopped around guys assuming that would let me forget him and move on because if he was out of sight, he was out of mind. But it truthfully has made my mental health worse. I have lost my romantic touch everywhere, and I am someone who has always loved love. I can’t imagine myself in a relationship, I can’t even try to look for other people. I see good looking guys but the thought of being with them makes me nauseous and timid — something I’ve never had to deal with before. I’ve been in contact with my ex for the last month and a half. It’s been good. He’s been good. We hooked up twice, more so because we have and had really good chemistry all around — he knows me, I know him. We talked about us, but we agreed we couldn’t be together right now — also because he needs to catch up in body counts to consider dating me. But I can’t shake this feeling that we just aren’t going to work out at all. Now or in the future. I want him, but not him . I want how he knows me and loves me and fucks me in a different guy. I can’t look at him and consider him without thinking about what I’ve done to him and how he treated me before. I have an appointment with my doctor next week to talk about antidepressants because I have genuinely never felt lower in life, not even when my mom was in the hospital twice in the same week. Unlike most people with depression (stereotypically), I look forward to my uni classes because that’s all I have right now. I am going to talk to my dad about it I think this weekend as he has always been there for me and deserves to know. submitted by /u/Fickle-Tomorrow-5575 to r/depression [link] [comments]",

Any proven practices (platform choices, key distribution rules, verification, etc.) - especially when selling keys directly (outside of Steam) or distributing keys to influencers/press? Which platforms/payment processors are the safest? Any rules you follow when giving out keys? Is this mostly unavoidable and just needs to be \"priced in\"? I'd really appreciate any insight.

I'll be in the area already after a family wedding, so I would definitely be arriving on Thursday if I went, might stay Thursday-Saturday or might stay the full weekend. I know the music would be up my alley no matter the lineup, but I have some questions about the festival culture before I make a final call. 1. Is it easy to socialize/make friends as a solo festival-goer or is it more couples and families? 2. What is there to do besides the music? Are there activities without an added cost? 3. Is it worth it to do one of the curated meals as someone into food? Is the food similar to a dinner of that price you'd get at a fine dining restaurant, or is it overpriced because it's at a music festival? And finally... 4. What's the vibe like in general? Dirty hippies (like myself)? Influencer Coachella type crowd? Families? Little bit of everything? submitted by /u/borzoi_boy to r/askportland [link] [comments]",

Also I haven't figured out the game logic behind this when creating new fleets. For example: Fleet #4 Fleet #2 Fleet #1 Fleet #3 So instead of being able to drag and drop fleets in the UI, I am left with the option of MANUALLY transferring ships to a different fleet and just changing their name. I saw that it was a good idea to separate your picket ships and artillery ships with their own fleets but halfway through a play-through I just ended up making all of my fleets to be all-rounded which ended up having ship behavior that I did not desire. This is a noobie asking the community on their thoughts and possible advice. P.S. This is actually my only pet peeve, I am pleasantly surprised by how mod friendly it is. submitted by /u/Level-File5949 to r/Stellaris [link] [comments]",

The way he justifies things are so warped, like talking about how “You left me Franklin”, as if Franklin had any choice about the fact that Louie went behind his back, and forced him out. Louie and Jerome would have done the work for Teddy if they didn’t have to go to war with Franklin. Like he can’t see how his actions might be what rubs people up the wrong way, instead he always says how “I can’t believe they’re behaving like this” and the behaviour is a very normal reaction to his cruel behaviour. And I think he gets this from his dad. Everything Teddy does, even the way he talks, it’s like he’s gotta make sure everyone knows “I’m the one in charge”, even proposing to Parissa seemed a bit premature.

They don't actually want to make a game, they just want someone else to make the game they want to play. This is someone you should call out. They'll probably be delusional forever if you don't actually give them a reality check. Games aren't made with wishes alone. Also, game development isn't this horrible thing you should avoid doing. They should be made to face their own self-doubt instead of hiding it behind their enthusiasm. I don't know because I have stopped making games a while.

      "title": "Does Islam's handling of slavery prove it's inherently misogynistic or supremacist?",
      "content": "I've been digging into classical Islamic rulings on slavery and it's left me genuinely confused. From what I understand: Quran 4:24 explicitly allows Muslim men to have sex with female captives/slaves (\"those your right hands possess\") even if those women were married before capture, the prior marriage gets overridden. Classical fiqh (across major schools) says the owner's sexual access to his female slave doesn't require her consent; refusal without \"valid excuse\" can make her disobedient and subject to discipline. Consent isn't treated as a legal requirement in the premodern texts, ownership itself makes it licit. Modern Muslims say slavery is abolished and these rules are historical, but the text itself permitted what we'd today call non-consensual sex with war captives (including married ones), which looks a lot like sexual coercion/rape by modern standards. So honest question: Does the fact that the Quran carves out these exceptions (without requiring consent) show an inherent misogyny or supremacist framework baked into the religion? Curious for perspectives from everyone; sources appreciated. Thoughts? submitted by /u/zarraf03 to r/exmuslim [link] [comments]",

You had to make yourself an account, kinda like in movie star planet and then you could go shopping on that big street where you could swipe to the right and there were more stores. It was 2d and had kind of a cool style. The characters didn’t have that cheap looking giant head style i think. I remember your character being kinda small but idk how much that helps. I think it had kind of a story to it and you had to unlock stuff but i’m not too sure anymore. I remember making many new accounts because I always forgot my login.
