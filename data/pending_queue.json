I kind of wanted to do direct through PSA this time just so I could better track the progress of my order. Without the membership it’s $27.99 a card. The membership at $200 for the year (might as well get CardLadder pro as well since I want to anyways) gets you $18.99 per card bulk submissions (minimum 20 cards per). I’m not sure how often I plan on sending in cards this year. I’m just trying to figure out the best value option. I’m not a dealer or anything I am just in the hobby for fun and if I make money, great. What does everyone think is the best grading option? submitted by /u/ORDinary_card_guy to r/psagrading [link] [comments]",

Instead, as a and b get closer to being opposites, the returned angle is closer to 0. The more a and b point towards the same direction, the closer the returned angle is to π. Why exactly is that? I have made sure the axis is tangential, and I am excluding cases where the vectors are exactly opposites. submitted by /u/Alezzandrooo [link] [comments]",

They pointed out: The game most likely stores which feather you've shot/\"taken\" down, regardless of how they respawn, and this game memory most likely reset once you've hit all of them. It then checks if you did it in the correct order, if not, no trigger. And this is precisely what I was wondering for the longest time. Shouldn't such game logic be relatively easy to find in the code? Why did none of the crazy Reddit RDR2 detectives find anything similar yet? Even before that, can we somehow infer from the code whether the spider webs or the feathers are triggers that change the game state in any way? submitted by /u/alasthennars to r/reddeadmysteries [link] [comments]",

Go for a sanctify. Affix replaced. Crit Damage turned into All Stats. https://i.imgur.com/RcFi4LS.png I originally wrote this post in anger. Today I am just sad. Sad that a game I was really enjoying now feels utterly pointless to play. Sad that I was finally talking my gaming buddies into joining to compete on the leaderboard. And now I don't even want to play. This is the second time an incredible item has been ruined this way. The second character that now feels dead. I took a 3 day break the first time. Now I just feel like: why bother playing? Players and content creators begged endlessly to remove temper bricking. When it finally happened, the game felt great and engagement BOOMED. Little did we know they slipped something worse in the back door: Now you brick your items after investing tons of resources into getting them to sanctification phase. Now you can actually make your items and your character WEAKER. Bad or useless sanctifications are fine. That's RNG. But ruining your gear, making it worse/weaker/useless is just terrible. I would literally be better off if I hadn't played Diablo at all yesterday. I logged in, played a few hours, and ultimately went backwards. That's a brutal, backbreaking feeling that isn't why I play ARPGs or games at all really. The dev behind \"Affix Replaced\" should be moved to the Overwatch team. This sucks and hurts bad. :/ submitted by /u/muckbeast to r/diablo4 [link] [comments]",
