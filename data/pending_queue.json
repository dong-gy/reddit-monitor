However, after 20 days I got my Steam page up, I only got 35 Wishlist. It seems it already become a failure. I am proud of what I have created but the business side looks dumb. I am rushing on making the demo but already feeling a bit of unmotivated. I post my intro video on other place and people critic my animation is not professional. Actually, I feel I can make good art assets but making a whole game is facing too much problems not only art assets. I just want to finish it. How do you keep the energy up?

The past few days, I implemented new animations, swimming, rolling and smooth transitions to jumps. I also made it so that when you attack, your character takes a small step into that direction (size of the step is depending on the weapon class). I also fixed some small issues with my camera, to fully make it so it doesn't clip with the solid terrain anymore. Next up, I will be implementing climbing, then charged attacks, and then more weapon types (sword & shield, daggers, spears, bows, magic wands) We will finish this month by improving the AI, because right now they aren't that fun to fight.

The game has an honor system, so finding a way to get away while saving people's lives should be rewarded. No, the game says, that's evil, you get an honor loss for killing those horses. People in town will look at you as evil for killing that horse. Shoot 1000 stagecoach guards? Fine. That horse is just an animal, at the end of the day, you kill plenty of animals for no honor loss. It kind of feels like the game is saying \"how dare you!\" for killing a horse (or dog for that matter) while having no trouble with the slaughter of anyone or anything else in my way.

Everyone’s brining everyone and trying to hang everyone for all of this bonobo bullshit. Like if you hang Trump and Clinton then bring your nooses to Chili next.

He was born rich into some yakuza shit and had concubines of his own like as part of that life. but he gave it all up and yeah he even gave up his scumbag crypto grift lmao more or less idk there’s this desire in people for more and more and more .

There are a lot of really talented mod creators in this community, and I respect the work they put in. That said, one thing I’ve noticed is that paid mods sometimes get reuploaded or shared for free. And in some cases, people might download them without even knowing they were supposed to be paid in the first place. Because of that, I’ve started to wonder about paid mods in general. In a game that’s built around modding, does selling mods really work long-term? Or does it kind of go against the nature of mod culture?

Still, I have some questions: Is it possible to beat a level whose enemies are higher level than you? How do I build accessories? I heard that speed is important but I also see that some tanks have increased shield with more attack, and I know in some games out there, some stats are completely useless. So how do you decide what stats to focus on? What’s a good general team make up? I’m running 2 attackers, 1 tank and 1 healer generally but i feel like I’m lacking in damage How to prevent my Merry from getting one shotted by spite enemies at the beginning of the match? Are levels or accessories more important? Finally, if you don’t mind, pls suggest some voidpets I should absolutely focus on now since I feel I’ve stretched my resources too thin already (out of frustration with floor element match ups…) so I don’t want to waste any more on the ones that won’t get value immediately Thank you! submitted by /u/Milwkwy_37 to r/voidpet [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Hi everyone, Lately, I’ve been feeling really overwhelmed by how relationships and dating are talked about online and in general. Everywhere I look, it’s about manipulation, situationships, “ignore them to make them chase,” creating lack, pulling back to increase attraction, power dynamics, and all that. I’ve personally gone through this mindset in my own experiences. What makes it more confusing is that I’ve actually manifested people and situations into my life things that once felt impossible did happen. Yet even after “manifesting” them, I still find myself constantly thinking about them, getting anxious, overanalyzing every interaction, and feeling emotionally overwhelmed instead of calm or fulfilled. Like its me questioning my authenticity. It feels like dating has turned into a psychological chess game rather than two people simply getting to know each other. wanted to ask: Have any of you gone through this phase? How did you let go of this toxic, hyper-strategic mindset? What helped you shift toward something more grounded, secure, and real? Would really appreciate hearing personal experiences or perspectives from people who’ve consciously stepped away from this way of thinking. Thanks for reading.

Purpose : GPUs are specialized chips used for gaming and AI model training, areas where Nvidia dominates. Leadership : The GPU effort will be led by Kevork Kechichian, Intel’s EVP and GM of the data‑center group (hired Sept. 2025), with Eric Demmers (former Qualcomm senior VP, hired Jan. 2026) also on the team. Status : Intel describes the initiative as early‑stage and plans to shape the strategy around customer needs. Context : While Nvidia did not invent the GPU, its GPUs are central to its success and give it a commanding market share. Intel’s move represents a notable expansion beyond its traditional CPU focus.

I could chill and do something else, but addicted as i am to my mmr I'm just gonna queue next game, maybe ranked to get back everything i lost, maybe normal game just to play something without pressure. And guess what, now i am easily triggered by any mistake i see from my teammate. Maybe there is a smurf or much better player on the other team. He wants to win, i want to win, finally, something. Being in this state of mind, i can already tell we gonna lose the game, so i give up at minute 10 and maybe gonna start troll a bit. Maybe my teammate said something. All of this is gonna provoke mass reports on my account. And here we are, i hate dota, i quit, i uninstall. But what if there was a mode for players who feel like they are gonna troll the next game and it's better to do it in a proper and safe environment, safe for your mental health, your mmr and behavior score.

      "title": "Review of \"The Girlfriend Project\"",
      "content": "This review is mostly spoiler free, with me commenting only on the themes and initial plot. Discussion about specific story points will be tagged as spoiler. The premisse of the web comic is the classic, pretend to be in a relationship and then develop real feelings. Julia is a working class university student, who doesn't know how she's gonna pay for her tuition after her scholarship has been canceled. Ryn is an aloof rich girl, and the black sheep of her family, and needs someone to bring home for Christmas, since she lied she had a girlfriend. Ryn proposes to pay Julia's tuition if she pretends to be her girlfriend to her family. As I said... this is a pretty basic premisse, but when well done, can be pretty enjoyable. And it is quite enjoyable. The art is good and the story and dialog are mostly very well done. But the most significant part of the comic, is how the protagonists' relationship to their families is portraited. And which it makes worth it reading it. Ryn's family is mildly putting horrible to her. All her mother does is belittle and insult her. Her father doesn't care one bit. She is bullied by her sister and cousins. But interestingly enough, her sexuality is basically a non factor. Ryn is out to her family... and even though they use every opportunity to mock and abuse her, she being a lesbian is not one of them. While, Julia has a very loving family, that truly cares for her, and she for them. She's very close to her step mom, but she's specially close to her father. And because of that, she feels the weight of his expectations for her to marry and have kids, and since she can't make herself fight them, she tries delay it while catapulting herself to Narnia in the process. It creates a very contrasting dichotomy, where Julia is accepted and open to her family about everything except her sexuality, and Ryn is unable to be herself and isn't accepted by her family, except for her sexuality. But what made me want to write this review is how the story tackles the subject of self discovery and coming out. At least for me... being used to yuri content and reading these stories, being gay becomes the world's default. Even when characters struggle with it, it's more as a way to delay they getting together, than an actual exploration of the issue, that makes you go \"Yeah yeah... you're gay, she's a girl, get over it and kiss already.\" And although this is also a delay tactic in this story, the way it covered the subject was very well done and emotional. It had me in tears, and hit very close to home, and I'm sure it will with a lot of queer people. This is what I think makes this worth a reading. It's not all perfect though, the story falls into clichés, and have some serious pitfalls. The writing quality really takes a dive in the last quarter, but I can't really discuss it without getting in spoiler territory. But one thing I can say is that in the last quarter of the story, they introduce a few queer characters that are, in my opinion, offensively stereotypical. It feels like what Ben Shapiro would come up with if you asked him to create LGBTQ+ characters. Spoilers: What a terrible ending. What happened there? It's bad... has no emotional impact... it makes no sense. I can't count the number of plot holes because it's all holes. After they finally get together... Julia for some reason has problems going out as her girlfriend, the thing she has been doing for almost a year at that point. So Ryn goes to the event alone, and Julia finds out it's a single's auction so she has now to find a way to save Ryn for some reason, instead of , I don't know, sending a text \"Hey... I changed my mind, can I still go with you?\", or even a \"I just found out this event has a single's auction, did you know this?\" Then they treat this as the most humiliating thing that can ever happens to someone. After years of being abused, bullied, belittled, controlled by her mother... this is her coup de grace. Being tricked into signing up of a date auction... a thing that happens all the time and no one bats an eye at it, as everyone knows it's just for fun and not like sex trafficking. Ok... then maybe Ryn can just say \"No thanks... I'm leaving\". They literally wrote that Ryn would not need to be protected anymore. She fought her mother for the first time. And then became a mumbling idiot that needed Julia to come and rescue her, when all she had to do is say \"Yeah... I'm not participating.\" And don't get me started on Julia... she needs an outfit for the event and suddenly has none. She has been going to events with Ryn and her family for a year. She used dozens of outfits. The literally showed them clothes shopping for Julia. What happened to all those outfits? No... the only thing Julia has in her wardrobe now is cliché lesbian flannel shits. Then her father comes to save the day... And I'm thinking \"Ohhh... he's gonna give her her mother's dress. Something him has been keeping up since she died\"... nope. He gives her his suit. His man's suit... made for him... a man's a foot taller and half as wider than Julia's. And magically the suit fits like a tailored woman's suit. And not happy with that... while pressed for time... she stops to cut her hair short, to complete the \"man of the relationship\" look. And then what was the point of Julia's whole public declaration? They had already gotten together. Sure Julia showed a bit of hesitance, but they didn't broke up, they didn't fight. It's the kind of thing a text can fix. Both already knew how the other felt. Both wanted to be together, and both knew the other also wanted to be together. Wouldn't be much more interesting for Ryn to still be dating June when Julia finally decides to confess. Have Ryn take June to the event, and unbeknown to both of them, Julia goes as a guest of her internship... that way you create conflict and drama. What was the point of Ryn dating June? If she would magically break a day before Julia decides to finally confess. It's not even like Ryn finally realizes she still loves Julia... no because she knew it all along. There was never a question of \"Maybe June is the right person for me...\" Again... wouldn't be more interesting if Ryn had introduced June to her family, and her mother loved June? Make her have the acceptance of her mother for the first time and realize it's hollow without Julia. No... let's just create a dumb nonsensical scenario and have Julia make a unnecessary declaration with no stakes and no emotion. And yet... that's not even the worst part about the ending. The worst part is that Ryn's conflict with her mother is not resolved. They literally interrupted Ryn's confrontation with her mother with someone saying \"Sorry to interrupt\" and had then take Ryn away. Are the writers self aware and lampshading it? Are they joking... or they didn't even noticed it? And I'm yet again writing fan fiction here... but have Ryn actually have to choose between being free, or the financial support of her mom. They alude to that, but again... the confrontation is interrupted and nothing comes from it. Have Ryn actually turn the tables on her mom and voluntarily reject her money. Being the sparkle that makes her mom start to respect her, while reinforcing the theme of Ryn learning to be independent and stop relying on other people. Any ways... I'm done. Such a good comic with the most disappointing end. There's so much more I can complain about it... but I those were my main points. Regardless... I'm glad I read it.

      "content": "I feel like everywhere I go it's politics. I always feel like I have to be careful about what I say around people, thinking I'm going to get chastised for saying the wrong thing. This post is a little ironic given that I think most of Reddit doesn't hold the same morals as me, but I hope you readers can see where I'm coming from regardless of anywhere you stand ideologically. I actually dislike both parties. I wouldn't ever say I associate with one, especially given how you can have totally opposite stances on different topics. But if you really must know, I'm actually about (-1, 1) on the political compass . I dislike how so much of politics today is just bickering, and a competition of who can reply with the more insulting meme. We could go on and on endlessly with this, and where does it get us? Nowhere. We make instant assumptions about people's entire character based off one statement, or just because they agree with one thing that one person did, without thinking about the nuances of their beliefs. Everything is political. Why? Why is it that everywhere I go someone mentions politics even when the topic has nothing to do with the sort. I think people have to understand something: life is so, so much more than politics. You know the saying \"Great minds discuss ideas; average minds discuss events; small minds discuss people?\" So many of us are stuck on events and people, when we are capable of so much more. It'd be cool to see us appreciate the coolness of humanity more in the world. I, at least, find it so hard to engage with others who differ morally with me; almost no one wants to engage in productive dialogue. I try to be as open-minded on manners, which is mostly how I've come to where I stand now, but people are so quick to anger when it comes to politics. And I could also rant about things I dislike about this and that person who's associated with that ideology, but that isn't productive either. It's just saddening to see how it's consumed so much of our minds. Overall I think we just have a broken nature. We cling onto these things because it gives us a sense of purpose. It helps us identity and categorize ourselves. But I deny that. I don't think we were meant to live this way. I think a lot of things, but this has been on my mind a lot recently. submitted by /u/buzzisverygoodcat to r/PoliticalOpinions [link] [comments]",

The hospital call me and question why he was there and I told them about his condition. They determine he is very sick and is now hospitalized due to all this conditions. He haven’t taken any medication in the last 3 years due to him refusing to take it. Hospital is making him take his medication and injections however we are worry that when he get let go of the hospital he will do the same thing again. I have talk to the doctors and they say they might give me a letter saying that he will benefit from having guardian. All I want is to get a letter from court saying that if we need to take him to the doctor we are allowed to due to his condition even if he doesn’t want to go. The issue is that he being getting lost and wonders for hours on the street without eating, he doesn’t take his medication and when we try to get him to the doctors they say he is an adult and you can’t do nothing onless he try to harm himself.

The setting: Aftermath of an 1800s Napoleonic zombie apocalypse in a reformed France that is apocalyptically and technologically saved through a dictator using divine Christian powers (The campaign is a 50/50 on both combat and roleplay) Requirements for the system (Yes i know all of these combined may sound a little unreasonable): - It can go in a long running game, im talking about around 60+ sessions or even a 100+ Homebrew compatibility with both lore and mechanics Combat that can be scaled with rules in place, im not a fan of free form combat, since I want to have my players feel powered up. I would want roleplay to be accounted for and having it be rules-light is preferred I want magic to exist but not intergral to a character, guns and physical capabilities are still the top. The rules are intuitive, easy to find and track. Im have horrible adhd so i cant really get through 700+ page pdf quite easily nor can my players keeping track of multiple mechanics at once. If a system doesnt have all of this, i dont mind suggestions for mechanics to incorporate No ai Context (Were anyone to ask): The reason for why I use a homebrew, because our og GM made the campaign using this homebrew bit he left preemptively.

Maybe I missed out on a dev blog.. or maybe some game lore about how it crashed explains the type of ship it is and why we can not fix it. To me it seems like a HUGE missed opportunity from space age to let that be the ship you fly to and from planets in. In a way it would be a challenge to not get it eaten/blown up by the biters to behind with. You could even add the possibility of it crashing again on other planets dooming you to being to process again. You could still have your point to point rockets for logistics and stuff but having that as an end game ship to fly between planets and land on them would be awesome. And has the developer mentioned anything as to why we don’t get planes in the game? After all we have bots, why not add a little gunship to fly around in. Worms can already spit acid into the air so not really game breaking if it’s balanced right. Tldr: We should be able to repair and fly the crashed ship from the start of the game.

Substance matters alot to me lazy replies \"hi how r u\" \"nm\" small talk with empty words thats a hard pass from me! Music is my lifeline K-pop J-pop R&B lo-fi metal rock metalcore indie anything that makes me feel something a good beat or meaningful lyrics. I sing I karaoke and very much enjoy a drink with friends while doing so a beer or some soju is perfect! I laugh way to hard when the jokes start coming out the more sarcasm the better if you can't take a joke that's your red flag not mine.

The HQ was moved to BLR for political reasons and avoiding legalities that Zepto might face is easier to handle in Bengaluru (things like founders being arrested and all like with an online gaming company purple-purple-fraud-fraud) so he’s hardly there he still lives in Mumbai so anyone wondering where he stations at it’s Mumbai He’s kinda not dating Amy, Amy comes from this elite escort service provider which give you “the girlfriend” experience, takes care of image management and and provides honey, Aadit is being a gentleman because he feels that’s how everyone should be treated and she’s only being a professional so he’s being extremely gentlemanly that’s how he looks at it and I think that’s graceful Amy is hoping that Aadit will “fall in love” like how it happens with Julia Roberts in pretty woman? Yea like that. Sohini’s arrangement was pretty similar but she got emotional when it was just a paid thing From what I have heard, Aadit is emotionally crippled (childhood traumas and underlying issues with parents and their choices i think) it’s not like he’s not tried to make genuine connections, he’s just not capable of them anymore, that would need him to fix his issues he has with his mom, start actually be taken seriously by his father and the consistent comparisons with the younger sibling needs to stop. Unless Aadit starts getting the real respect from his family specially his super controlling and “I’m always right” mom else he’s always gonna end up in these kinda situationships because somewhere his mommy issues come out like this and he thinks he deserves only this and main purpose is to achieve what his parents never could to prove some sort of point to them? TOXIC. Amy and Sohini circles don’t get along yes but Sohini changed her ways a bit to actually put in the work. There’s a friend of Sohini called Chandni Solanki who’s the same kind of services as Amy, you can tally this by how similar the profiles are. There’s this elite service in Mumbai that’s only for the ultra rich where either ppl like Amy are there or young girls from middle class families as well who wanna make some pocket money.

      "content": "Thesis: Min-ji and Mina Sue clash because they at their core are incredibly similar. Both are high ego, high self-esteem, but insecure with low EQs. I think that they're both transparent and have good intentions, it just...gets jumbled due to the insecurity and inability to \"read the room\". Min-ji has high ego and high self-esteem due to her career as an athlete. She HAS to believe in herself as a winner because that's how she can achieve success in her career. On the other hand, her athleticism translates as overly competitive and aggressive, which I think makes her feel more \"masculine\" to Korean men. I think she has perceived that men don't 'typically' go for her because she doesn't fit Korean beauty and gender behavior standards and that has left a bit of a 'chip' on her shoulders. Min-ji's strategy to get what she wants is to be aggressive. She trips herself up because of her aggression, she can't let things be and give it space. I think this aggressiveness was not the right approach when talking to Mina Sue. I also think that's why her conversations with Subeen & Sungmin may have been off putting for both of them. Mina Sue has high ego and high self-esteem because she's navigated being a minority in a western country. She fits Korean beauty standards some-what, but I'm willing to bet that hasn't always been the case growing up in the west. What probably helped is outside validation such as beauty pageants, academic achievement, & male attention ect. I think she's tried for things before and didn't succeed due to things that were not within her control. Mina Sue's strategy to get what she wants is to passively try and accumulate multiple options, then go for the more \"sure\" one. She self-implodes because she's passive aggressive and no one likes to feel \"accumulated\". Her mistake came from the bon-fire night, it was too apparently she had \"gotta catch em all\" energy. I think it could've been Her ego doesn't allow her to be vulnerable with Subeen, and now she's settling for Sam because he's the \"sure\" one. I think we've been watching their strategies play out to similar success tbd. Neither are really winners here, Go-eun really has finessed this game. Both Mina Sue and Minji think they're Queen's, but if you're the one saying it out loud about yourself...then the less believable it is. They are both their own worst enemy, and it's so transparent that it's holding up a mirror to us as an audience like a Rorschach test. I know it challenged me when I felt just visceral dislike for Mina Sue and such cringe for Minji - probably because I saw a bit of myself in them. Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk.

Video that made me happy recently: This is supposed to be a scary game Video note: Normally I post a cute animal video, but this is a streamer clip I first saw a long time ago. For whatever reason, when I first saw it, it made me laugh harder than almost any other video I knew of at the time. It might have just been the place I was in at the time though. Back then I didn't know who Jerma was... Previous videos playlist General update: At times like these more than ever I need to make these posts, but at the same time their effectiveness is greatly hampered by what I can and can't say, and by how much back-context needs to be explained to even explain what's wrong now. I considered returning to the other format for this post but since it's already getting late and I already copy/pasted this one into the new post, I won't. I have so much to do and more keeps getting put on my plate. My normal system of prioritization is failing due to a new deadline setup. To make things worse, I get so much anxiety I procrastinate, which means I stay up late to get things done, which creates a worse state the next day when I'm tired. That's why there are quotation marks in the title, because I plan to do that tonight, so this isn't as much of a winding down post as I'd like it to be. I've been promising to explain in the past few posts and though this is an explanation I know it isn't a very thorough one.

      "content": "First things first: I want to clarify that I am not a shipper neither I believe in any ship unless canon. This is just an idea that I wanted to share and did not know where. Please be kind. Brief and surface reasoning(just Sketch ideas): I want to clarify that I’m a Black Panther comic reader first rather than a Marvel Rivals player. But I found interesting the interactions that Hela and T’Challa share in the game. This interaction can be interpreted in different ways, either Hela being kind of flirty with him(which I discard taking in count her new interaction with deadpool) or just Hela being… well, Hela. But it make me question and think on how an actual relationship between them both would BE or even work to begin with. After hours of thinking, I realize that they actually can work pretty well together, but more as a flirty/platonic love rather than a long term relationship. I see them both having a complex secret situationship as lovers. I think that Hela can be a short chapter in a younger and more premature version of T’Challa’s life and journey as King of Wakanda. I like the idea of her toying with his beliefs and religion, accompanied by faith. I think that a strong part of their situationship would revolve around this side of both characters since Hela is the queen of literal Hel and T’Challa is the king of a nation with a strong belief in the afterlife and what comes after passing away. T’Challa is a noble king, and I see Hela as a reference and symbolism of falling into temptation, playing with guilt, faith, beliefs, and principles. Not as King. But as a Man. I see Hela as a way of breaking that image of unbreakable man, puting in doubt the beliefs and faith of T’Challa. I see Hela getting attracked to the fact of breaking the reasoning behind a man of strong integrity. Maybe because she want him to join her realm and try it by manipulation and seduction, which would be attached to breaking the man’s ideals. I do think there would be a natural or atleast hint of actual genuine emotional attraction, mostly by T’Challa, because let’s take in count that Hela is a the goddes and ruler of Hel, who’s principal interest are the souls of the death, so I think that Hela’s emotional aspect and attraction would be more complex but juicy to deal with. After this brief SURFACE explanation, I do think that this situationship would develop and benefit T’Challa as a character more than it does for Hela. Principally because I see it as a young version of T’Challa being king, a version that keeps learning and falling; and I think she would work for him as a lesson of temptation and inner responsibility as a man; religion and faith would be just a plot and addition to the complexity of the topic. I do see T’Challa falling in love or maybe getting some real appreciation for her. But I’m not sure about her. I do not know the character enough like I know T’Challa to really tell if she would really feel something or not. That makes me think the idea of a young T’Challa dealing with heart break and love disappointment while being a King tho. Lol. As you can see: I state this situationship as a way of developing a younger version of our favorite king in terms of love life. But I did not went that deep with Hela, principally because even if I know the character by the couple of comics I’ve read about Thor. I do NOT know Hela as much and deep as I know my favorite super-hero since kid such as The Black Panther himself. So I see her more as a villain rather than other. That’s why my vision and thinking kind of looks like she’s a villain here. I would love y’all to state your opinion and thoughts. Specially about Hela, I would want to know what would she gain from this in a more deep and inner aspect of the character rather than just something villainous. So if you think of something that can add to the ship in terms of deepness rather than just vibes, please do. I would love to read criticisms if it’s constructive or opinions on why this WOULD or WOULDN’T work. P.S: I am self aware that Black Panther is a character that tends to attract a lot of hate in the community. So please just be respectful. If you don’t like the ship: it’s fine and understandable. I would like to read your reasoning behind this. (The pics I posted are me and my girl btw. She ironically mains Hela and I main BP so I do think that kind of triggered me to elaborate the idea LMAO). submitted by /u/Away_Eye1036 to r/MarvelRivalsShips [link] [comments]",

I wanted something that let me: visually plan projects (not just list tasks) see structure instead of endless checklists So I ended up building a visual workflow-style planner where you can map projects, routines, and steps in a more spatial way. It’s still early, but I just finished polishing the UI and core interactions. Here’s a screenshot of the current state https://preview.redd.it/iqo616h3e4gg1.png?width=2236&format=png&auto=webp&s=b3be7540c929e4ccbba9b1cb615e15d5284f669d So I have a question for you all: - does the concept make sense at first glance? - would you personally use something like this? -what feels confusing or unnecessary?

Kayla Skrlik displayed some of the worst sportsmanship I’ve ever seen in a curling game. Not only was the rock Sturmays to sweep, but her sister very clearly burned the stone and that’s nobody’s fault but her own. My biggest quarrel with this is how Skrlik made Sturmay throw her last stone even though the Skrlik stone was very obviously not shot. Remarkable unsportsmanlike behaviour. If I were Sturmay I would’ve simply pulled the stone off on account of Skrlik even making her throw that last rock. Sturmay handled it well. submitted by /u/Double-Outcome1103 to r/Curling [link] [comments]",

Dry Rot itself is extremely hostile to anything, and has grown to a larger size and strength than the other stumps by just devouring whatever stumps were in Hollowed Woods with it. https://preview.redd.it/dpq47ybzi5gg1.png?width=1065&format=png&auto=webp&s=9277dac2996959e371d39efa87d3927f14f2014c https://preview.redd.it/7xt3k8t1j5gg1.png?width=973&format=png&auto=webp&s=b9f4a340c4bcbd8e3b7313318ac829511cbd568a Stumps according to the actual in-game models are around 10 to 11 feet (3.0 to 3.3 meters) tall...

      "content": "Personally, I have about 20 to 30 modern games on my Switch 2/PC/Steam I am playing through right now, and about 15 to 20 physical retro games on N64, PS1, PS2, DS, 3DS, GB/GBA I am getting through in my library. I probably play way more games than your average Joe developer, but idk. I play so many retro games because I study their design and their aesthetics. Also nostalgia. Sometimes I focus on modern games for a couple months, and then sometimes I focus on retro games. I prefer original hardware, but I mod or hack my consoles like my 3DS and PS2 to play Japanese games. Recently I bought a molded GBA with an IPS screen and USB C charger mod, suffice to say, sometimes I impulse buy cool retro stuff lol. Because that thing was not cheap. But it made me wonder, am I in the minority when it comes to playing retro games? Some indie devs like Jonas Tyroller think that game devs generally play a lot of games, yet others like Thomas Brush say they don't have time to play through much games with everything else in their life. submitted by /u/Chopdops [link] [comments]",

Does anyone know roughly how much gameplay time it takes to get to the point of needing to buy the expansions not included with the recent free code or VIP? I have VIP but dont want to buy the expansions until im near actually needing them. Is following the Epic quest line the easiest way to level? If yes, does it just linearly take you to level appropriate zones throughout the whole leveling experience? If no, can i just look at the levels by zone on the wiki and follow that? Should i just be doing the highest level quests i can? How does the instance finder work? Can i/should i use that at any point before max level? For reference i am fine with leveling taking however long it naturally takes, but i am not looking to get sidetracked. I want to actually get to end game in whatever is reasonable for the games pacing. submitted by /u/SWAGGIN_OUT_420 to r/lotro [link] [comments]",

Beelink mini, ryzen 5 6600u 16gb ddr5, built in amd 660m graphics, I know it's light, but it'll get me started. 43 and 32 TV's homemade controller out of my steam deck box w 8 buttons.. real high tech. Used baller installer So I set up as 2 screens. Put backglass, small dmd, topper, full dmd, music on 2nd screen. Baller doesn't say how many to set as \"visible\", both dmd's? Topper on disable, music off,sound only. Future pin games load ok, Only some actually show dmd and scoring. Vpx games are the most hit and miss, sometimes I have back glass, (finally figured I had to install b2s files), almost never have dmd or scoring. It's driving me frigging nuts. I've deleted and reinstalled the whole deal many times. Yet when I reinstall, a lot of my buttons setting were still there, even though I deleted everything I could find,windows was storing something somewhere... So I reinstalled windows, then baller. At least tables and back glass are in the right place now but still many issues with dmd's.. like backglass is showing OVER dmds. Anyone in NC want to make some money?

I just wanted to reach out and see if anyone has found any more clues/hints or even possible theories about the Pandora's box? It's been moved to the secret room in the lobby, with a sticky note that reads \"Times almost up\", so, I think it's safe to say that we have a limited time to figure it out. I'm not exactly asking for someone to give me the code outright, just maybe some helpful points in the right direction, if anyone even has any ideas. I've seen a few posts but they're all from months ago and some are even about the first box that was in the attic. Thanks in advance for any help/advice! Edit: I would also like to add that I know there’s a possibility that it IS a timed in game event, that there is no way to know the code, but I’ve also seen photos floating around of a server message announcing people had opened it. Correct me if it is confirmed to be a timed event however. submitted by /u/yayeeties to r/regretevator [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Hey everyone! I’m deciding between two concierge jobs in Glacier National Park this summer and could really use some outside perspective. The options: Pursuit – East side of the park Xanterra – Lake McDonald (west side) Both are concierge positions. Important context: I will NOT have a car I’m hoping to make friends , be social, and spend as much time outdoors as possible This is a summer seasonal job, so overall experience matters a lot to me From what I understand so far: Lake McDonald / West Side seems more central, easier to get around without a car (shuttles, Apgar nearby, more people), and more social with larger employee housing East Side looks absolutely stunning and quieter, but potentially more isolated although I'm thinking I could have better access to hiking (without driving?) I’m torn because the east side scenery looks unreal, but I don’t want to end up feeling stranded or lonely if transportation and social options are limited. For those who’ve worked for Pursuit or Xanterra , or lived on either side of the park: Which would you choose without a car ? Which side is better for making friends and having a fun summer outside of work? Any major red flags or things you wish you’d known?

      "content": "I'm working on a 1v1 multiplayer game, and I'm under no illusion that getting high player counts would be a monumental task. Yet, the game truly is at its best in multiplayer, when two players who actively.want to win grapple with each other. The game is built from the ground up around asynchronous play, so players don't need to be all online at the same time. Another way I'm considering is to not have matchmaking at all, and only run scheduled events — you don't need hundreds of players, just maybe 20 if they all show up at the same time. Besides, competitive aspect shines much more in an actual tournament environment rather than an impersonal ladder. What is some other advice you can give? Maybe someone grappled with similar issues before? submitted by /u/Majestic_Hand1598 [link] [comments]",

The only thing missing were some power-ups, à la the SNES' Baseball Simulator 1000 . The dev (Tipping Goat) is still answering questions on the forums/Discord, which is amazing for a 10-year-old niche game. Anyway, 98 of the achievements are boilerplate story/gameplay grinding achievements. 2 of them require some decent player skill along with a huge dose of luck to finish. (Double Rowdy and Pinball Wizard) The game never got in its way, and replayability is fun/easy enough to keep the hours reasonable and avoid a sense of tedium most of the time. (I left my game on a couple of times, so 48 hours is a gross overestimation of time needed. The hours take some time to figure out some of the pathways or cleverly hidden ones you need to track down.) submitted by /u/Zalym to r/steamachievements [link] [comments]",

Rookie 5 and 100 lifetime challenges also only take a week maybe 2. Basically its easy enough to get at least 7. My buddy got the game a week ago and has 10 already. This is basically a meta 6'8 that I set up to only absolutely need like 4 cap breakers to be quite usable online but still has useful spots for future cap breakers so you don't just feel the need to make a new build once you get them. First 7 go on the handle/SWB for 86/80. After that, 3 on 3pt for 92. After that, mid range and pass acc are both really solid options. submitted by /u/Himdoood to r/NBA2k [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Hello! I have a genuine question and I hope some of you could maybe help. I have been dabling into game dev for a few years now. I never got serious. And just made assets or concepts, I just did it as a silly hobby. Now I wanna get a bit more serious and make a small game to release for free. And maybe gradually get more and more serious with it. The problem right now for me is that I barely have any time after work to do it. And working on the Weekends is not really an option, as I usually work 6 days a week and need one full day for chores and to recover mentally a bit. I know discipline is important. But I genuinely come home from work and sometimes just \"pass out\" (Example: came home from work yesterday and I sat down on the couch to take off my socks and literally passed out for like four hours. When I woke up it was already kinda late to start working on anything. I only managed to cook dinner, take a shower and feed the cat) My 9-5 is more like a 6-6 situation. Where I wake up around 5 to get ready for work, then arrive home in the evening around 6-ish. Depending on the chores I have to do, I end up \"losing\" a bunch of time on cooking or cleaning or washing or whatever house related chore. And that without even spending time to \"unwind\" (like watching a video or reading something) So how would you approach this? Anyone in a similar situation? Getting a new job is sadly not an option for me rn. I imagine I'm not the only one in the situation. So besides the very obvious \"discipline\" is there a way to manage something like this? like maybe splitting up the chores? I already try to do the more time consuming stuff on the weekend? Do you, guys, have a specific way to do things or a schedule? I am very thankful for your answers. submitted by /u/Beef-n-goo [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Hello! I have a genuine question and I hope some of you could maybe help. I have been dabling into game dev for a few years now. I never got serious. And just made assets or concepts, I just did it as a silly hobby. Now I wanna get a bit more serious and make a small game to release for free. And maybe gradually get more and more serious with it. The problem right now for me is that I barely have any time after work to do it. And working on the Weekends is not really an option, as I usually work 6 days a week and need one full day for chores and to recover mentally a bit. I know discipline is important. But I genuinely come home from work and sometimes just \"pass out\" (Example: came home from work yesterday and I sat down on the couch to take off my socks and literally passed out for like four hours. When I woke up it was already kinda late to start working on anything. I only managed to cook dinner, take a shower and feed the cat) My 9-5 is more like a 6-6 situation. Where I wake up around 5 to get ready for work, then arrive home in the evening around 6-ish. Depending on the chores I have to do, I end up \"losing\" a bunch of time on cooking or cleaning or washing or whatever house related chore. And that without even spending time to \"unwind\" (like watching a video or reading something) So how would you approach this? Anyone in a similar situation? Getting a new job is sadly not an option for me rn. I imagine I'm not the only one in the situation. So besides the very obvious \"discipline\" is there a way to manage something like this? like maybe splitting up the chores? I already try to do the more time consuming stuff on the weekend? Do you, guys, have a specific way to do things or a schedule? I am very thankful for your answers. submitted by /u/Beef-n-goo to r/gamedev [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Breakthrough! I'm happy to share - after weeks of thinkering - that moments ago I've found the solution to the \"Error code 18\" for Epic Games Red Dead Redemption 2 installed with NonSteamLaunchers in SteamOS. Or basically the tweaks to be able to run RDR2 with NSL. The great news is that it allows to run RDR2 directly, or via both launchers, in Desktop mode and Gaming mode. Whatever is preferred. Cloud saves, share game activity with friends and steam performance overlay all work when running RDR2 directly from Gaming mode. Also this saves money having to buy RDR2 a 2nd time on Steam, and no need to deal with Heroic or Lutris separately for just this game. I'll report the solution on ProtonDB as well. Summary: Rockstar and Epic launchers need to be installed from NSL (in same prefix folder ofcourse), latest GE-Proton10-29 (download via ProtonUp-Qt app) needs to be set (check force compatibility steam play) for both launchers ánd RDR2 game in Steam library, WINEDLLOVERRIDES=\"vulkan-1=n,b\" command needs to be added in the Epic launcher's launch options in Steam (do not add in RDR2 launch options!!!), Rockstar Launcher's launch options in Steam need to be copied in full and pasted in the RDR2 launch options in the Epic launcher game settings/properties!!!, in the file ../user/Documents/Rockstar../Settings/system.xml change the value for adapter to 1 but leave API value to DX12, now run RDR2 for first time in Desktop mode from Epic launcher, login via Rockstar Launcher and done. Hope this finds another! :) Cheers I've posted the solution at NSL GitHub too: https://github.com/moraroy/NonSteamLaunchers-On-Steam-Deck/issues/869 submitted by /u/ScubyFlying to r/SteamDeck [link] [comments]",

I've already built the whole thing IRL and displayed it at a LEGO exhibition last month. Seeing how positively people reacted to it made me realise I should at least try submitting it. Now, it’s already close to 200 supporters which has honestly blown me away. I did discover there’s another Crossy Road project already up — and I genuinely hope both get support, because it’s a game that means a lot to many people.

      "content": "I've been wondering about the performance difference in games where enemies are constantly creating and destroying instances of their state classes, versus an approach where enemies cache their state and simply reset the values when jumping back to a previously used state. I haven't tested it myself since I'm very new at all this and haven't really got the time at the moment, but my best guess is the former is more cpu intensive while the latter uses more ram. So as usual there isn't a \"best\" solution and it all depends on the needs of the game and its bottlenecks. Either way I'd like to read the opinions of experienced devs on the matter, maybe the caching is a bad idea, period, and the traditional way is always better, but due to recent performance-related issues with modded minecraft due to the garbage collector I'm inclined to think otherwise (or maybe that's just java and/or mimecraft's code jankiness). submitted by /u/Y-oshirin [link] [comments]",

(If you happen to be curious about any of this check my profile here and find my twitter profile and you can see what my games are there) In this example I'm demonstrating death/destruction effects on enemies. This is in a test room with test objects around, so don't take it too seriously, but I always liked how swords cut enemies in half in mega man zero so I took that idea and ran with it. Blunt weapons can smash them into tiny pieces. Crunching up enemies should be intrinsically rewarding and that's what I'm hoping people find when they eventually play it. edit: I'm sharing because it helps stay motivated but I'm always open to feedback if anyone has any! submitted by /u/thedeadsuit [link] [comments]",

In that respect, for example, the Pixel, with its seven years of updates, is unbeatable. So, if you buy a OnePlus, it will work perfectly for many years (my OnePlus 7 still runs like a dream today), but after five years, you'll have a fantastic phone without updates or security patches, making it insecure and, for many people, useless. So, I don't understand the point of making these phones so great and then not providing better support for them. From 2027 onwards in Europe will be required that the battery be easily replaceable by the user, and I hope that Europe will also promote progress in the updates. Of course, no one from OnePlus or OPPO will read this. submitted by /u/omgletmeregister to r/oneplus [link] [comments]",

It has been developed by a very small dev team, so we appreciate anyone who checked out the game - it's a true labor of love for us and we hope you will have fun in I Hate This Place!

      "content": "Hi everyone, I've been working on a proof-of-concept web app that lets you play PICO-8 multiplayer games online with your friends. PICO-8 multiplayer games are designed for local play and you need everyone physically on the same keyboard or controllers. There is no native way to make online multiplayer games in Pico-8. How It Works With PICO Party, one person hosts a room and everyone else joins with a 4-letter room code. The host's browser runs the actual PICO-8 game and streams frames to all players via a peer-to-peer connection (WebRTC). Remote players see the game in real-time and their inputs are sent back to the host, where they're injected directly into the PICO-8 runtime as if everyone was pressing keys on the same machine. Will work even if users are on different networks. This means any PICO-8 game with multiplayer support works out of the box . No cartridge modifications needed if your game uses standard btn() calls with the default bindings. You can play multi-cart games and also use play any custom game as long as you have a link to the .p8.png url. Players can play on mobile with touch controls: a virtual D-pad and action buttons. Great for playing with friends who only have their phone. Try it at: https://picoparty.io Submit Your Games! The current library is pretty small. I've basically just been adding games I have been playing with my friends. If you've made a multiplayer PICO-8 game (or know of one that would work well as long as it is Creative Commons 4.0 or you have the author's permission), I'd love to add it to the library. Just open a PR at https://github.com/dwjiang/pico-party-games with: Cartridge URL (.p8.png) Game name, author, description Player count (min/max) A few screenshots Once the code is merged, the change should trigger a deployment and you should be able to see your game in the app within minutes. Future Feature Ideas If there is interest, I can continue to develop the app. Some ideas that I have: Audio streaming - Currently only video/frame data is streamed. Working on getting game audio to remote players too Public lobbies - Find random players to game with Cartridge discoverability - Allow users to sort by popular/newly added cartridges Saving progress - Saving cartdata so users can continue previous sessions. If there's a feature you'd want, let me know. Feedback Welcome I would love to hear what you think, any bugs you find, or games you'd like to see added.

I did it because I wanted to support the community — both on Wayfarer and in Pokémon GO — especially in smaller towns where there are very few PokéStops. I put a lot of effort into my submissions because I actually care about improving the game for other players. What I don’t understand is why people like me get punished for supposedly “small mistakes,” many of which I strongly disagree with or which are simply not true. In the end, you receive a negative mark, and all motivation is gone. It feels incredibly discouraging. What makes this even worse is that there are clearly people who ignore criteria completely, submit low-quality or abusive content, or otherwise misuse the system — and they often seem to be overlooked and not punished at all. That is extremely frustrating. Instead of focusing on those who clearly break the rules, the system seems to target players who genuinely try to help. Because of this experience, I’m honestly at the point where I don’t feel like doing anything for the community anymore. And that’s the real shame here: the people who put in the most effort to improve the game, especially in rural or smaller areas, are the ones being pushed away. I think this is something the Wayfarer community and Niantic really need to reflect on, because this approach drives away the very players who want to contribute positively. submitted by /u/ugartecard to r/NianticWayfarer [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Hello everyone, I’m planning my upcoming indie game and I’d love your suggestions. The game is a story-driven experience where you play as a character who is short on money and opens a small store with their savings. The store does not do well, things start falling apart, and one day a mysterious guy approaches and asks: \"Wanna be the guy?\" From there, your character gets involved in all sorts of shady and interesting activities. You clean up crimes, complete jobs, and eventually build your own empire. Unlike typical tycoon games, everything is scripted like a story-driven AAA title. Every action and event is part of a carefully crafted narrative. Here is the thing. So far, it mostly feels like a walking simulator. I really do not want that, so I would love suggestions for mechanics that make the gameplay engaging while keeping it story-driven. Thanks so much for any feedback. submitted by /u/Creepy-Ear-5303 [link] [comments]",

Added ranked ladder, seasonal rewards, cosmetic marketplace Solo project Tech stack for the curious: iOS native (Swift/SwiftUI) Cloudflare Workers backend D1 database Real-time matchmaking At launch: 70+ characters (all free from start) 6 factions with unique clan bonuses 8-card decks, 2-4 min matches Cosmetic-only monetization 📱 Pre-order: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/elarion-aetherfall/id6754101666 2 days out.

The code conan decipher is so challenging that it hard stops many smart character's of fiction. The code conan originally received was in Japanese but in English it translate to this- \"I'm a major league slugger. This is the beginning of extended inning game...? It doesn't matter if you prepare a good stopper... I will turn around the game in the end...\" So here is conan deduction P1- Major league refers to a American baseball league. C1- The entire code must be decipher in English. P2- A good stopper in baseball refers to strong earned run average statistics or Era. C2- The abbreviation of earned run average is Era. P3- Extended innings game in baseball can also be called extra inning games. P4- If you remove Era from Extra it leaves XT. P5- if you put XT vertically and move 180 degree then it represent the Japanese Kanji 文. P6- Kanji 文 represent schools. C3- The bomb is in a school. Now, conan cuts the wire of the bomb in the elevator 3 second before it blast. It result in conan to not get the whole clue but the part of it which was EVIT(unlike the letter this was English even in original translation). P7- Evit turned around will come out as tive. C4- The whole word is actually detective with tive being it's last part. P8- Detective in Japanese is 探偵(Tantei) P9- Reversing 探偵(Tantei) gives you 偵探(Teitan). P10- There are school with teitan 偵探 in it. C5- Mixing P10 and C3 it comes out that the actual place of the bomb is teitan school. P11- There are 3 teitan schools. Elementary, middle and high school. P12- The culprit behind the bomb is targeting people in it attacks intentionally. P13- In winter only teitan high school is active cause of there exam. C6- The bomb is in Teitan high school. Tge reason why this deduction is so hard or good is cause there are no guesses, induction or abduction. Each step follow necessarily from the pervious. And it is also very hard as conan has to realise many thing during the deduction process like- \"MAJOR LEAGUER\" → TRANSLATE TO ENGLISH \"GOOD STOPPER\" → ERA → REMOVE FROM EXTRA → VISUAL ROTATION INTO KANJI \"EVIT\" ON A BOMB LCD PANEL → REVERSE DETECTIVE → JAPANESE REVERSAL → TEITAN And also conan was in extreme pressure while also psycoanalysing the bomber and he correctly deduced 2 separate cipher joining them flawlessly with a countdown.

      "content": "I'm making a Dungeon Crawler Rogue-Like using structure blocks, trial spawners, vaults, decorated pots and utilizing Loot Tables for all of my rewards found in the dungeon. But to actually make the game play like a Rogue-Like I'd love to have unlockable items. To my knowledge there's no way to modify a loot tables without going into the file and directly editing it. But if there is a way, that would be amazing. I had an idea to pull it off where if an item that isn't unlocked yet spawns, I can detect that and kill the entity and replace it with an unlocked item before the player picks it up. I'm not using Chests anywhere in the dungeon, so items will basically always exist as an entity at some point. But ideally, actually modifying the loot tables would be amazing. I'm not all the familiar with Loot Table Functions yet, I know how \"set_count\" works but that's kinda it. If a function could check an in-game Score, or something of the like, and then completely change the item, that would be awesome. Alternatively if it can't change what item it is, maybe it can change the other item data? Like enchantments, custom name, and custom attribute modifiers? That wouldn't be as good, but still really helpful. Thanks! submitted by /u/BenManGinger to r/MinecraftCommands [link] [comments]",

      "content": "First it was the CnD ult that used to stack heals, then it was 12 seconds ult Luna ult and now it's Gambit's ult. Now Loki isn't the broken per say, but his very existence makes these ultimates even worse to deal with \"Oh you're having trouble countering insert the OP support ult that comes with every season how about you do it twice!?\" Now for how I would fix this issue I must first put up an amazing example that just happened to me in a match. Friend is playing Loki and in overtime the enemy CnD ults. Now it would seem like the only option is to copy your other support and stall the game. Except....this genius bastard copies the enemy MAGNETO and takes out the CnD and their Bucky with his ultimate. Then proceeds to help our tanks push the other team away, winning us the match. Noe THIS! this is the type of playmaking you'de from a GOD OF MISCHIEF!! So to keep encouraging these type of plays, I would simply make it so the Loki's that copy ults from their tanks or dps get rewarded with stat buffs if they manage to get off a kill. Like: you double ult with your Punisher and manage to wipe away the Luna ult? Congrats now for 30 seconds you have increased damage and lowered cooldowns! Oh You copied your Strange and stunned and killed the diving Magik and Daredevil? now You have 200 overhealth and your runes get 100 more hp for 40 seconds! Oh you copied your strategist!??? you get nothing and your copied ult starts at 95% instead of the normal 100% I don't want to take away the option to just copy your other support, but instead i want to increase the value in making risky plays! You know, make the character trickier! submitted by /u/MedusaSucks68 to r/marvelrivals [link] [comments]",

For example, if you have a single stick and want to convert it into left/right impulses: var input = new Complex( state.ly, -state.lx); input *= Complex.Exp(Complex.ImaginaryOne * Math.Tau / 8); left = input.Real; right = input.Imaginary; As opposed to a dual stick control mechanism like: left = -state.ly; right = -state.ry; This is most likely to help in physics-based vehicle controls.

      "content": "Created an UpdatePartComponent step to begin to separate the physics update from the internal vehicle update logic. Moved RocketCore and RocketNozzle update logic from the physics loop to Rocket.UpdateRockets. Moved ResourceManager from RocketNozzle to RocketCore to increase the separation between core (internal) and nozzle (external) association. Added propellant mass flow rate to nozzle and core readouts. Fixed very excessive propellant usage due to a sign flip in the consumption logic. Created FxTemperature part component to drive emission and thin film intereference maps. For the moment, this is driven purely from nozzle temperatures. Added FxTemperature component to SubParts with models and components that support it. Removed ResetState() method from PartComponentStateful as it was no longer needed. Fixed a few bugs with higher order symmetrical editing, added a few bugs with higher order symmetrical editing. Swapping between symmetry orders with multiple layers of symmetry inheritence is still a bit touch and go. All in all, going in the right direction. Use PartComponent.TryGetFrom() in a few places where it's less verbose and updated some related doc comments. Added a method to get mutable access to part component states for serialization and UI-context modification. Fixed a case where part components would incorrectly think that they couldn't be updated, leading to emissive maps not working. Improved behavior of temperature emissivity sim, especially for engines at low throttle. Increased maximum temperature for thruster emissive by 1.75 times. Increased thruster emissive intensity. Merged Part and SubPart classes. This should allow us to simplify quite a bit of logic doubling. This is not meant change the player-facing functionality of Part vs SubPart in the game. Quite a bit of clean up is still needed and given the wide reaching changes unintentional regressions should be expected. Return individual TStates and TFxStates by reference instead of by value from PartComponentStateful.StateList. Added individual component and state getters to PartComponentStateful.StateUpdater to match the interface of PartComponentStateful.StateList. Moved the Tank processing from the old TankList to the new PartComponent/State system. Made hot path initialization for type updaters infallible to avoid the infectious complexity of null checking in the vehicle update task. Removed the isEditorUpdate flag for vehicle updates which no longer has a purpose. Created an InertMass part component and shifted readers to use that instead of the template. Added in missing part components from top-level parts. Removed unused PartTree.TotalSubstanceStorageVolume. Moved one last mass template reader over to the part component. Converted engine and thruster controllers into part components. Created a GetSubtreeComponents() function to iterate over all part components of a given type for a part and its sub parts. Fixed a few accessors in PartComponent.List which weren't returning the concrete component type correctly. Return sub parts as a span instead of a collection. Removed thruster/engine controller properties on PartTree. Converted the subtree components generator into a ref struct enumerator to avoid allocation and used it in an additional place. Removed some redundant code left over from tanks moving to part components. Moved some PartTree functionality out of the Part class into the PartTree class. Added a Split function to the PartTree class. Tightened access to the Parts list in PartTree so that it must go through PartTree functions so we can eliminate logic errors where other code outside this class could change the Parts list in the PartTree without performing other related logic in the PartTree. Changed the public Parts collection in PartTree to be a readonly span. Made the static part list on PartTree private. Marked two PartTree lists as readonly. Use GetSubtreeComponents() for inert mass display. Fixed some pipelines being mislabelled as 'Byte[]' Fixed potential issue in Physics IntegrateVelocityVerlet where mass properties were not set for initial state causing a mismatch between first derivatives and half-step derivatives. submitted by /u/panic_in_the_galaxy to r/kittenspaceagency [link] [comments]",

It’s hard to tell what’s a bug or just me being stupid when I’m unfamiliar with so much. I will definitely upgrade at 4.6.1, but wondering if my concerns are valid or just yeet it? If the concerns are valid, what are some guidelines to follow and pitfalls to watch out for if I wanted to upgrade now? submitted by /u/hammeredzombie [link] [comments]",

En especial con noticias recientes de que hasta parches están dañando SSDs y la situación de seguridad y vibe coding en Microsoft está terrible. La vara es que yo uso mi compu 99% para gaming. Tengo un setup relativamente high end. De hecho ya tengo una pequeña partición de Ubuntu que uso para varas de desarrollo y tengo un boot manager que hace default en Windows. Quiero consejos para migración...cual distro es buena para gaming? Cómo está la compatibilidad (juego principalmente en Steam pero también tengo algunos juegos retro en GOG) con Proton? Uno puede usar Proton para juegos que no son de Steam? Tengo entendido que jugar en linea es casi que imposible. Solo jugaba BF6 pero ya casi no, y siento que para eso puedo preservar una partición de Windows. Lo que quiero saber es si es posible \"invertir\" mi configuración de discos duros sin borrar muchas cosas. O sea, en vez de 500 gb de Ubuntu y 5tb de Windows, hacer 5tb de Ubuntu, eso puedo hacerlo o tengo que volarme las 2 instalaciones?

However when trying to move the camera around the viewport I noticed that it gets stuck moving in one direction when I press the key a bit longer. It seems that it \"caches\" the input and keeps using it to move. When I release the mouse button and select any kind of text field, the cached characters get immediately pasted there and the issue disappears until I try to do more stuff in viewport and the whole scenario repeats. It makes any learning almost impossible and really frustrating, as - for example - I cannot press a key to change transform if there is already some input stored. Have you seen this before? Do you know how can I fix this? The issue can be seen in this video . I have released the W key around 2nd second of the recording and kept moving with only RMB held. At the end you can see that \"wwwww\" was pasted into the text field at the bottom just as I selected it.

I read that the deadline has been extended to June 30, 2026, and that the work submitted in 2024 shouldn't have been carried over to the 2026 edition. However, when I opened my gradebook, I noticed that it also marked the 2024 work as valid submissions. Is this a bug? Or does it mean that the work completed in 2024 is also valid and doesn't need to be resubmitted? I know that learning is what matters, but honestly, in a difficult moment in my life, I'd like to be able to hold a concrete result in my hands as proof of my efforts, even if it's just a certificate.

It's got the standard 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi (no 5 GHz listed, which is interesting) and the label diagrams seem to show a top-loading dustbin, which would be a nice little convenience. Based on the 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi, I'm guessing this might be a new Q-series refresh or a mid-tier model rather than a new flagship S-series. Where do you all think a bot like this would fit into Roborock's current lineup?

      "content": "No links yet, just want some honest feedbacks. More about the game: Hundred Nights DIFU is a Chinese hell management simulation indie game where you get to manage how souls live in their afterlife. At its core, it has a lot of humor, some sense of cozyness, and a pure build & management gameplay. We take some gameplay inspirations from Two Point series, Prison Architect, and even Dyson Sphere Program. We are a small indie team of friends who share the same passion for game dev and simulation games. The game is still way too early in development stage but we do hope steam page and playtest will be up within this year (follow me for more updates!). So, what do you think of the capsule art we are preparing? 1 or 2 and why? If you have other ideas/feedbacks, please let us know! Much appreciated for all your feedbacks! submitted by /u/LeofromDiFu [link] [comments]",

Videći da su RAM cene otišle u kurac i moj trenutni laptop koji sam uzeo prošle godine (R5 6600H, RTX 3050, 16GB DDR5) dosta koči u većim projektima, mislio sam da uzmem upgrade. Razmišljao sam da uzmem Macbook Pro M4, sa pro M4 čipom, 512/24, našao sam neki od 2050e na KP. Pošto macbook apsolutno nije upgradable, mislio sam da se fokusiram na pro čip i više rama a za storage da uzmem barem neki eksterni SSD kasnije. Laptop koristim kao sekundarni/poslovni uređaj, imam računar kod kuće. Voleo bi takođe savete koje alate da koristim. Kontekst, radim game dev samostalno (Godot, Blender, FL Studio, itd) a u firmi radim C++ (Visual Studio), ponekad kotlin/javu (Gradle) pa me zanima da li ima neke razlike u alatima koje se koriste?

I've created a health component that handles health given/taken and death, and a health interface to handle communicating between characters. Basic stuff. I implemented the interface on the health component itself instead of on the characters. The idea being that any character I add the component to will already have the interface implemented. It works great, but (and maybe I'm over thinking this..) it feels slightly wrong somehow. In order to apply damage to a character, I need to [get components by interface] because the target implementing the interface is the health component of the character, not the character itself. Example in the comments as I couldn't add an image here. So basically my question is, does using the [get components by interface] function defeat the purpose of using the interface? submitted by /u/ShmodyP [link] [comments]",

As someone who is trying to get into the industry and having worked on short films, I can only imagine the amount of work this took. Hearing about it all on Distractiable and through videos doesn't compare to going through it and with the behind the scenes coming out, we all can tell how much love and creativity went into this. Audiences know when you've put in the work and you've tried your best for a project you love. The sound design, art, costuming, vfx, lightning- everything about it made me feel what I feel for movies when I was growing up. Real sets, seeing an actor engage with real props and the hard thing of writing something surrounding \"one location\". Really cool stuff. It's really inspiring seeing someone go from playing video games at their desk to making a feature length film, especially one that's self funded and is backed with so many people who support it. Just thought I would put it out there that this has really inspired me to go for things and make them happen. I loved the film and hope others also feel that spark of inspiration. submitted by /u/FijianGecko to r/Markiplier [link] [comments]",

Like all this time we basically had one less accessory slot because of the boots and now that accessory is free for more build customization. This feels especially good as a summoner because we have multiple basically obligatory accessories to wear because they offer minion slots. Even if making other items obsolete is the reason I dislike finch wings so much, this time it feels warranted because of the absolute grip hermes boots had on accessory builds all the time. Not only that, but they made me care about a mechanic I never even thought about up until now: ice slime block slide. It is so insanely fun. Now, they are a bit overpowered and I dread the day when they will probably be nerfed to the ground. submitted by /u/Poisson18 to r/Terraria [link] [comments]",

I put out a demo last year just to see how people would respond while I was still working on the full game. It didn’t turn out exactly how I imagined at the start, and I definitely ran into my own limits as a developer, but I’m okay with that. Maybe I’ll come back to it someday and see what I can improve. I hope someone out there has fun playing it. On to the next one! submitted by /u/DAMStudio_BR to u/DAMStudio_BR [link] [comments]",

Close to nill. We have tested for colorblindness, non-issue. We can match colors, put the red ones here (if we have a red one there). If we ask, where is the red one, he guesses every time, this applies to all colors. Sometimes working with letters, and given 3 choices, he will get them right... For instance which starts with g... \"Green\" and point to it. He knows black, and white, sometimes brown. Other than that, he pretty much never gets it right and instantly guesses a wrong color. Without questioning he would say \"pink!\" or \"the red light\" or \"blue and red make purple\" Any suggestions? Am I just over thinking it? I feel like he should know them by now. Chatgpt suggested working on just red, which we have been doing for a week and I still feel if I asked him what color \"some red object\" is, he'd get it wrong. submitted by /u/ctarb to r/homeschool [link] [comments]",

I want to expand my zoo, but I have exhibits where there are way too many animals, but I can't sell them or release them because they're almost all new babies. I can only put them in the trading post, so the trading post is clogged with animals. I can put the animals on contraceptives, but then they all die out unless I'm paying really close attention and then I have empty habitats. Even if I don't put ALL the animals on contraceptives. Is this it? Is this the game? Just monitoring the breeding of your zoo and trying to balance the population?

The scholarship and total debt I would be taking on is about the same at both. I'm from the northeast and have no problem settling in PA/Philly long term. I am currently leaning towards Temple due to its location in Philadelphia and its slightly higher ranking/reputation. Since I would already be living in the city for school, I imagine it will be easier to network and secure summer internships/work in Philly, and I know that Temple has great connections in the city. But there are things that make Penn State attractive (a major university, an extensive alumni network, a more secluded location to focus, and, to be completely honest, football/basketball games/being a BIG10 school). I know both are pretty close in the rankings (#50 v. #59), but University Park is kind of the “second campus” for Penn State. I am planning to visit both soon, but this sub has been a great resource throughout my process, and I would appreciate any input or thoughts! submitted by /u/Icy_Tourist6609 to r/OutsideT14lawschools [link] [comments]",

Working on an unannounced roguelike autobattler we keep running into the same dilemma with Slay the Spire 2 announced for March. When to announce the game? When to push your demo?

It is a roguelite with soulslike inspired combat, where you will play as a knight, an archer and a mage, each with their skills, strengths and weaknesses. My ideia for an engaging combat is to apply some rules I personally learned from playing some souls games, like no cancellation animation, stamina management, lock-on on enemies, well-timed parries, dodges and skill activations. In the efforts to make the combat work with multiple enemies, it ended up with some free flow flavor. Hope you enjoy it, any feedback is welcome, specially on the combat itself. submitted by /u/John_X_MacTaviX [link] [comments]",

Seems some people draw shadows and put them on a layer so they can toggle them on and off but then confuses me how they can make the shadow adapt to different surfaces. Other method I saw was duplicating the asset, flipping it and using a shader to turn it into a shadow so they can rotate it for a day cycle but that seems rather complex to make it look good. Anyways sorry I know this has been asked but couldn’t find much info if the latest Unity engine can speed up this process. submitted by /u/owlsmoke [link] [comments]",

      "content": "So I am making a game that is in 3D, but needs to look like a 2D top-down viewpoint (currently achieved with an orthographic camera at a 45-degree downward angle, plus an altered camera projection matrix courtesy of huwpascoe's pull request. The sprite is y-billboarded towards the camera. Because the game is viewed from a top-down angle, I drew the sprites in that manner. However, for animations like the one pictured (walking south), the feet moving forward in space is visually represented by the pixels being drawn lower on the sprite, which makes them clip through the ground. https://preview.redd.it/rh5fcr2dnjgg1.png?width=292&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ff2c9fbec530d301621d42689ce7adba0461219 In this picture, I show this clipping along the edge of a floor, so you can see both the sprite clipping through the floor and the edge of the floor revealing the underside of the sprite. I need to find a way to allow the part of the sprite that clips under the floor to still be visible, without causing the sprite to become visible through other objects that SHOULD block the view, like walls. For a while, my solution was to make the sprite be offset towards the camera equally along the Y and Z axes, which wouldn't appear in the camera view, but long-term, I think this workaround could still come back to bite me, like if I wanted to ever include proper shadows and lighting, it would reveal that the sprite is hovering. https://preview.redd.it/8mm8ke7rnjgg1.png?width=384&format=png&auto=webp&s=313703c9fb49b406ebec97802186646db39001a2 https://preview.redd.it/eqbsyygrnjgg1.png?width=687&format=png&auto=webp&s=a5ba5be8a84cd85bf12c3c7a8a862eb05f9645db Pictured above are screenshots of the full 128x128 character pixel canvas being filled with a test texture so you can see the extent of the sprite canvas on the AnimatedSprite3D, as well as what the player object looks like in the engine viewport.

The kind of response that smooths things over and keeps everything comfortable. I felt it form automatically. The right words, the reassuring tone, the version of myself that makes things easier for others. This time, I didn’t say it. I stayed quiet longer than felt polite. The silence was uncomfortable, but it was honest. Saying what was expected would have meant setting aside something I wasn’t ready to dismiss. Eventually, the conversation moved on without the reassurance I would usually give. Nothing exploded. Nothing broke. What stayed with me was realizing how often I trade honesty for harmony without even noticing. I’m still figuring out where that balance should be, but choosing not to perform that moment felt like a small boundary I hadn’t known I was allowed to have. submitted by /u/Rich_Outcome8649 to r/self [link] [comments]",

I worked for my daughters first year and have been home the last year and a half. Recently I’ve really realized the flow of the home, weather the house is happy and flowing or chaotic if really down to me as the wife, mom, and home maker. I have an incredibly helpful husband but he goes in to weekend flow mode because that’s what he knows. He’s been home the last 10 weeks with me and new baby. The magic of Christmas and making memories is down to me as mom. It all feels a little intimidating realizing that it feels like I always have to be a step ahead, on my A Game , getting up early, and planning ahead to be a good present mom who has the time play with my two little kids. It’s a constant crazy balancing act and if I’m not always on and going the systems fall apart. How are other moms handling this?? For reference we live in a very small old space and we cloth diaper and cloth paper towels to save money, no paper plates. So there is always laundry, dishes , always fighting old house smell, constant pick up due to no play room. Toys are in strategic bins all around our small house. submitted by /u/SMFKT_99_17_21 to r/CatholicWomen [link] [comments]",

In Persona 5 I guess this would translate to how much of the compendium could you fill via recruiting persona's and fusing them together before you send the calling card for each palace? I know technically it's possible to reach level 99 in kamoshida (o7 to YourBudTevin for the grind) so hypothetically is there ever a point in which you would run out of fusions to make only having the pool of kamoshida to work with from the start? submitted by /u/Alex_Drewskie to r/Persona5 [link] [comments]",

      "content": "I’m looking to get a fitting at club champion (due to gift card there specifically). Initially I was only planning to use the driver fitting in order to get shaft specs that fit my swing more. The current promo lets you use the fitting price as a credit towards a club. I have 3 year old fitted irons currently, but feel like I would benefit from a fitting as my handicap has dropped from a ~18 > 9 at this point. I’ve never had a driver/wood, hybrid, wedge, or putter fitting. The gift card I have is $180, enough for a driver fitting without the promotional sale ($50 if buying a custom club). The fitting price for a full bag, with the purchase of a new club, is $100. An idea I had was the use this promotional period to get a full bag fitting for “cheap”, and then use my $180 gift card to buy the cheapest club that would make me qualify for the promo. So my question to the community is, how much do you think the cheapest custom club purchase would be? I’ve read that they have all those extra costly fees like the build fee and the “puring” fee. I’m just trying to weigh the difference in pricing and whether to just use the gift card for a normal driver fitting without the discount and paying for a club, or taking advantage of the full bag fitting opportunity. TLDR- what’s the cheapest custom club purchase that I can make at club champion in order to take advantage of the full bag fitting promotion for $100 submitted by /u/Solid-Drop-2780 to r/golf [link] [comments]",

I know Mikan feels like she would be a waste of a survivor slot so if they were thinking of making her a survivor, I feel like they might have to make her more useful throughout the game and build more confidence for herself throughout the trials and potentially help our protagonist out as like a support of sorts In summary: Im PRAYING for mikan being a survivor but something is telling she might be a victim. leaning towards Survivor Most upvoted character gets to be talked about tomorrow Make your predictions for Mikan, too if you so please. submitted by /u/OneDragonfruit8042 to r/DanganAndChaos [link] [comments]",

I've run into a problem: my assets are 1.4 MB, but when I convert my project to an APK, the size jumps to 25 MB. I know it's small, but it's the first version and has almost nothing. I've seen games with many more features that are only around 3-5 MB. Also, I can't use the library optimizer because I can't use Gradle (if you ask, I only used 8 ARM, and my game's APK is 25 MB). My game code is only 99 lines long, and I only use 2D; I didn't use a character body in the project. Note: I developed it in Godot 4.5.1 on a mobile device. submitted by /u/t_l_h_anonny [link] [comments]",

A lot of speculation has surfaced about this ending, such as you needing a perfect performance to complete (or the complete opposite, a terrible performance), attempting to romance Malevola, or aceing every single hacking sequence (including the optional ones). I was wondering if anyone had tried just not choosing any responses when you're able? Not sure if anyone knew this, but if you let the decision timer run out, it just picks a decision for you, and though I haven't tested it, I think it might be possible this isn't random, which leads me to think a possible way to get the ending is literally do nothing.

      "content": "In the mid-long term future, I plan to leave my job in a western studio and start a western-style indie PC games studio in Asia. Not sure what's a best investment until then, learning Chinese or Japanese (traveled to both). As for China: Future stability . Risk of war/economical-visa restrictions/ possible VPN law changes for the Great Firewall. Easier chinese visas, less starting capital required. Harder to get visa-free residency. But Japan's future leans right-wing and anti immigration. Content restrictions are only an issue if selling to the Chinese market (same restrictions for a company in the west selling to Chinese citizens). Much easier to hire/fire talent in China (bigger talent pool, applicants more open to small remote-first studios, lower cost of life/salaries, much much easier to fire a bad hire that would kill the company in a small japanese bootstrapped indie project). Japan talent pool has a worse demographic future. Worse opportunities for outside investment for games. I'm planning to bootstrap with savings, but don't want to close doors to future investment. Chinese publishers invest first in mobile/multiplayer (at least now), not my focus. Western publishers avoid Chinese companies due to worse intellectual property/legal protections. This is usually handled by keeping intellectual property and cash in an empty US Holding Company that outsources development to the Chinese one, but might be too much friction/risk for western investors. China is worse for selling the company. For a western publisher looking to acquire, even if the intellectual property is in the US holding company, it seems like a risk to buy a Chinese dev team that can go dark with a VPN law change. Long-term life/culture. China feels easier to integrate into. Prefer the bustle and hustle rather than the japanese zen with slow grind. Immigrants in Japan struggle to feel \"accepted\". Should I learn Chinese or Japanese during these previous years? China looks better for bootstrapped indies and lifestyle, Japan better for established/publisher focused big companies. submitted by /u/SavingClippy to r/AskAChinese [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Hey everyone! I'm trying to create a compositor effect in 4.5 that processes the color buffer based on stencil buffer values (doing custom highlight and outline effects). I've followed the 'The Compositor' tutorial in the docs, and got things set up the color buffer. So for the next step I've tried to add the depth buffer(1.) and it isn't going well. I thought I could follow the same pattern as using the color buffer in my shader. So in the glsl code I declare my buffer uniforms like so: layout(rgba16f, binding = 0, set = 0) uniform image2D color_tex; layout(rgba16f, binding = 1, set = 0) uniform image2D depth_tex; And in the script I fetch the buffers create uniforms/set as follows: var color_buffer = render_scene_buffers.get_color_layer(view) var color_uniform: RDUniform = RDUniform.new() color_uniform.uniform_type = RenderingDevice.UNIFORM_TYPE_IMAGE color_uniform.binding = 0 color_uniform.add_id(color_buffer) var depth_buffer = render_scene_buffers.get_depth_layer(view) var depth_uniform: RDUniform = RDUniform.new() depth_uniform.uniform_type = RenderingDevice.UNIFORM_TYPE_IMAGE depth_uniform.binding = 1 depth_uniform.add_id(depth_buffer) var uniform_set = UniformSetCacheRD.get_cache(shader, 0, [ color_uniform, depth_uniform ]) The shader compiles just fine. But when I run the script I get a few errors repeating every frame, the first one being ERROR: Image (binding: 1, index 0) needs the TEXTURE_USAGE_STORAGE_BIT usage flag set in order to be used as uniform. Now I'm not sure why I get this error for the depth buffer uniform and not the color buffer. I tried bitwise or'ing the TEXTURE_USAGE_STORAGE_BIT (so depth_uniform.uniform_type = RenderingDevice.UNIFORM_TYPE_IMAGE | TEXTURE_USAGE_STORAGE_BIT ), but that gave me an error stating that the uniform_type value was out of bounds. So I'm not really sure where I am going wrong. Clearly I am misunderstanding something. Is anyone able to point me in the right direction to figuring this out? submitted by /u/FernwehSmith [link] [comments]",

SFA is constantly insulting me and my intellect, so is the post-burn timeline which never should have picked up in another series. I see 2 options: either we come together and pull off some kind of blitzkrieg legal battle, which eventually forces Paramount (or whichever subsidiary is on charge right now) to never release another episode of that clusterfuck of emotional molestation. This might be hard to do, given the fact that they already dared to release 4 episodes, with a fifth one due for next week. Even if we hire the most slaughter-ready lawyers it might be to late to make them stop. The other more sane, more effective option would be to have someone on the inside who identifies all digital copies, production files and master images of that show and make them go away without a chance of restoration. This would need some kind of administrative access, and of course a person with lots of honor and selflessness. There are times when people are implored to act by their fellow civil brothers and sisters. This time is now. Only Paramount superusers can stop the destruction of our franchise. Yes if we delete all SFA copies now, there’d be still the 4 episodes floating around but they can always be considered to be a tragic example of selfish corporate media frenzy, an attack on fandom itself.

Not mechanically but I am going to delve into some pretty reprehensible topics. Vile darkness etc.... I always ask players to let me know what is off limits. I do not wish to make people uncomfortable as I have very few limits myself. Most my players are the limit. I have no issues with really abhorrent things if it's done for the right reasons and not just shock value (Though sometimes that is a good thing). I find myself running into too many players saying they have no limits then going. HEY! That's too far!. It's too far I get it. We won't pursue this. Why did you not tell me this before? It would not have come up? Does anyone else have this problem? I run games about violence and its consequences among other such things such as power dynamics. This shit is dark and I refuse to glorify it. Why can't people just be honest? So many problems can be avoided. I am not talking about the really obviously avoided things. It's the smaller stuff that is setting them off. Players if you have a problem with a topic and the GM and you are asked PLEASE be honest and say so that way it does not come up. I am not a fan of X-Cards or even doing these kinds of checks ins since people lie but I don't know what to do at this point. No one seems to have a problem until they do. When asked \"Why didn't you say I would have happily avoided it?\" They go this shit is disturbing why would you go there and I am like I am using it BECAUSE it's disturbing. I want to face this. All of my writing is very personal and my last game I wrote essentially consisted of a me writing about coping with suicidal ideation and moving through it and never say those words but the professional health workers I played with picked up on it immediately. Tell the DM if you can't handle the topic. Don't lie and say you can. Please... I know some times we thinkwe can but discover we cannot but I have heard too many times now.

Bonus points for making her relevant in the NEXT patch, thus making this argument kind of obsolete. What if they randomly decided to give Vivian a swimsuit skin in OCTOBER, but NOT Miyabi, who as an ice character would (probably) be able to resist the cold. Bonus points if they acknowledge the fact that it was weird for them to do that since it was no longer summer time. What if they gave literal NPCs, characters that you literally CAN'T PLAY AS and thus won't be able to see as much, a skin, but NOT the VERY playable Hoshimi Miyabi. Bonus for giving them to NPCs that are actually popular, which would give this point less traction. What if they gave PAN FUCKING YINHU, a character who probably has like 5 fans, a skin, but NOT Miyabi, who is one of if not the MOST popular character in the game.

Australium Weapons are reskins of weapons to look like solid gold (technically Australium but it looks like gold.), and needles to say they look extremely cool. How would you get one you ask?

All for at best a 5% chance per TOUR to get an Australium Weapon. Yareli (Warframe). Yareli was a Warframe in the game that while not necessarily optimal, was very fashionable and unique. How do you get it? By completing an hours long quest line requiring you to perform extremly difficult tricks on a K-Drive, a rather Niche mechanic that (up until then), no one had any reason to use. I heard that it was made much easier, but I still will never get back the hours I spent on that quest. Characters in any any HoyoVerse game. The characters in all hoyoverse games often have very unique character designs, backstories, and great voice actors. However, to get these characters you either have to spend absurd amounts of money, or grind the most tedious, insanity inducing tasks for weeks on end to save up enough of whatever in-game currency to get any reasonable chance of getting ONE character. This is completely ignoring all the things you have to do to make the character optimal, which requires more grinding and oftentimes spending even more on gacha to get the character's weapons and other characters for good team composition. submitted by /u/WHATISREDDIT7890 to r/TopCharacterTropes [link] [comments]",

On top of that, a lot of Taobao or Alibaba links either bug out or don’t show up at all, and even tracking and QC pics have been hit or miss. It’s getting pretty frustrating to deal with. I decided to try Hipobuy after their recent site update, and it’s actually way more convenient than I expected. You can use cnfans links directly on Hipobuy without converting them, and cnfans spreadsheets seem to work fine too. The whole site just feels smoother and more reliable overall. They also brought back 30% off shipping coupons, which is nice. On top of that, if you forward your packages from the cnfans warehouse to Hipobuy, they pay for your domestic shipping, which is kind of crazy. I haven’t really seen another agent offer something like that before. With all the issues going on with cnfans, switching to Hipobuy honestly feels like the logical move at this point.

Use NordVPN normally for up to 30 days. If you don’t want to keep it, just request a refund & they process it without hassle. That’s how people are getting both the lowest price and a risk free trial. I wasn’t sure at first, but I tried it myself and it worked fine. Important Note: Skip “coupon code” sites.

This also allows them to leave the dark world and enter different ones without turning to stone, and it works like yinyang, the knight is yin, and ralsei is yang (alot of people make the mistakr of thinking that yin is the white).

      "content": "Some time ago I brought my plan for a Pokémon Fanfic, and I'm here to talk about another topic. I'll leave the link to the post for you to read. This time I want to say that I intend to adapt the two Pokémon Legends games, and I wanted to show my proposals. Legends Arceus: The story will tell the origin of the Fujiwara Family, and of the one who started it all, Christopher Fujiwara. He was a character of unknown origin who was chosen by Arceus and as a bonus received a natural gift for Aura, something that his descendants would inherit and improve. And in the future it is revealed that Christopher married Akari. Legends ZA: This one is still in the planning phase, but the biggest difference is that the game will take place 20 to 25 years after XY, to show my characters older, married and with children, including my OCs, and the protagonists being precisely those children. But it's also an idea that I might apply to the Tenth Region, but that may depend a lot on how it turns out. Soon I intend to make a post talking about the love interests of my OCs, but for now I would like to know what you thought of these ideas for the Legends Saga. submitted by /u/UsualWishbone4416 to r/pokemonfanfiction [link] [comments]",

      "content": "About three years ago I was making a music video and found I really liked environmental storytelling and world building. I decided my next project would be a video game. Since I already had quite a bit of experience in Blender and virtually none in any game engines I decided I’d figure out a development approach that lets me do most of the heavy-lifting in Blender. That’s how I ended up with a game that is 90% pre-rendered. The overworld backgrounds, the cutscenes and even the turn-based combat is all pre-rendered. It’s a bit of a nightmare to work with at times but I’m really happy with the result. The way I’d describe the game itself is a mix of Disco Elysium, Fear and Hunger, Look Outside and Bioshock. For the Disco Elysium inspiration, I wanted to create a world that felt truly lived-in with lively dynamic characters who are shaped by the world they inhabit. It also has a similar system for handling skill checks and there being multiple solutions to quests. For Fear and Hunger and Look Outside, this is the exploration, scavenging and combat elements of the game. I was especially inspired by the unique encounter design in Look Outside. Bioshock is a huge inspiration for the setting. I’ve wanted more games set in doomed underwater cities so I decided to go out and make my own.

      "content": "Hi! We’re a tiny team making a cinematic psychological horror game: Untold Memories: Potter’s Field. You start as a cemetery night watch, monitoring CCTV for “anomalies” — but the more you watch, the more it feels like the cemetery is watching back. What begins as a job slowly turns into punishment. What to expect: • CCTV/surveillance loop + investigation (you eventually have to go outside) • Story-first psychological horror (guilt, memory, revenge) • Atmosphere over cheap jumpscares Demo is live. If you’re into slow-burn horror, a Steam wishlist helps us a ton. Steam page + demo link in the comments. Question: do you prefer CCTV-style horror, night-shift horror, or story-driven psychological horror? submitted by /u/Barisimsi [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Good tidnings, everyone! I'm new to gamedev and Godot and trying to learn gamedev by breaking down some mechanics from different games. Here's the question: How do you change gravity vector of a CharacterBody3D? I know that RigidBody3D can do so via collision with Area3D, but I want to make it independent , so I can stick my character to any wall I want. I thought about this kind of a solution: When change-gravity-button is pressed, a collision sphere gets first collision and its normal and sends it to gravity component, where it then interpolates character global position to collision point global position, counts difference between floor and character in angles and rotates it so player is perpendicular to the floor, and whenever we change walking surface the algorithm repeats submitted by /u/murdered_ronin [link] [comments]",

      "content": "I had an experience in Warzone that honestly crossed a line for me, and I think this is something the developers need to look at from a design perspective. A player used the hostage/carry mechanic in a way that visually resembled a sexual assault scenario, undeniably. I know the intent of the mechanic is tactical and gameplay-driven, but the way character models animate and how players can position themselves makes it very easy for someone to create something that looks extremely disturbing and inappropriate. Player downed me, took me hostage and took me to the corner of the wall simulating rape action. It triggered my PTSD! This isn’t about trash talk or normal toxicity — this is about how a gameplay animation can be misused to simulate something horrific. It caught me off guard and genuinely made me uncomfortable. I’m not blaming the game for player behavior, but I do think this is an unintended visual outcome of the mechanic that should be reviewed. Small animation or positioning restrictions could prevent this from happening without affecting gameplay. Has anyone else seen this? And how can we get this in front of the devs so they can adjust the mechanic? I’ve reported the player, but I think this is a design oversight that deserves attention. submitted by /u/Aggressive_Bill_2822 to r/Warzone [link] [comments]",

How do you manage financially while working on your games? For you, is game dev a side hustle/ hobby, or are you trying to make it full time?

For the last year and a bit, I shifted into working on a major project and I am finding that instead of playing the game to look for bugs/improvements, I have been playing for the high score/ to experiment with builds and just for fun generally. It's a really cool feeling getting to enjoy a game and realizing that it's something you made yourself and any ideas you have can be implemented. I've never experienced something like it before and I'm wondering if this feeling stays after you release your games or if this is a feeling that is consistent with every major project you work on? submitted by /u/BeesAreCoolAlsoAnts to r/gamedev [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Hi everyone. I’ve been working for quite a while on a platform called Homespace ( https://store.steampowered.com/app/2508170/Homespace/ ). The core idea is that players build virtual homes and then play mini-games inside them. Recently, I decided to make a key focus of the project the idea that Unreal Engine developers could create their own mini-games, publish them, and sell them within our platform. It seems to me that creating mini-games is much easier than developing full-fledged games — even small indie ones — and if we already have an audience, this could be a very low-barrier entry point for developers. Moreover, we could provide an additional source of income for level and mini-game creators. And on a broader level, even if hardcore Unreal developers aren’t particularly interested, we’d still be lowering the entry barrier to game development for regular users — encouraging them to start experimenting with Unreal and even coding if they want to do so within our ecosystem. What do you think about this idea? Am I right in this assumption, and does it make sense to implement something like this at all? submitted by /u/General-Lock-1079 [link] [comments]",

After I conquered my video game addiction in my mid teens and started actually socialising they were dissappointed in me and continued to pressure me to do IT courses which I hated. I told my father that he basically enabled my video game addiction which ruined my childhood and early teens and yet hes still in denial. Well at least I actually did became a video editor/camereman at a local TV station but obviously the pay isnt as great as software devs but I'm happy and I get to meet interesting people, also being an attractive man sorrounded by mostly female colleagues feels great to say the least, haha.

Right now, it’s hard to build any plan tactics with club members. Adding a dedicated chat space would help players mentor each other and stay active. It’s the one missing piece to making clubs feel like a true community rather than just a list of names. Any chance this is on the roadmap?

If a Magician is shot while deflecting, the bullet will be deflected back at the shooter and deal damage! This makes it great for deterring the aggressive playstyle of the Mule, and can create strong opportunities to get a free reload off when down in the count. I'm super excited to keep showing off more of the game when the time is right. I've put a lot of heart into this game, so I want to make sure I give it a proper launch. 😁 Let me know if you have any other class ideas you think would be cool to see in game! submitted by /u/Calm_Salamander_2447 to r/rblxoutlaws [link] [comments]",

It's a horrible map in that regard. I avoid it. Your modding community has shown more love and care for the game than you do. You just rake in the money and let them make the game for you. You should be ashamed of yourselves. Genuinely consider giving the game to the modding community. You clearly have done so in a less literal sense. You take suggestions(which are insanely easy to code and take little to no effort), and put them \"under consideration\" for years. It's depressing. Please get your s*** together. I've never had this many issues with a game in my LIFE. Not even THE SIMS 2 ON A MODERN PC has given me this many issues. It's easier to reinstall the Sims 2 from the ground up than to run POT.

I don’t mind supporting the game, but this doesn’t feel very player-friendly. If you agree, I’d encourage sending feedback in-game about the event and pass prices.

For the card game, I used opposing and matching elements instead of numbers. There's also a round element, and whoever has the most of that element's icon on the board at the end of the round gets a bonus. Tried to make it as self-explanatory as I could while still providing multiple avenues for points and victories.

I needed to destroy the object but to leave the PS for all of the particles to die beforehand. I tried destroying the model first, and then particle system, however it was not possible because while trying to destroy the children of cloned object I got an error telling me that I am trying do destroy prefabs. But doing so with the parent object (which was instantiated) works. I tried unparenting the PS as the tutorial showed, using transform.parent = null. But the error popped up saying the parrent cannot be null. I will try to just make two separate objects one with model and one with particle system and instantiate them. But it feels a bit clanky? Is there any other solution and am I missing something? Thanks in advance :) P.s.

In the winter, instead of the power station, I connect the LED lights directly to the truck’s starter battery using an always-hot cigarette outlet that I installed in the truck bed. With this setup, I’m not getting any power to the lights, and I’m not sure why. I know the cigarette outlet itself works because I use it to charge my portable power station. That makes me think the issue is either: • a voltage incompatibility, or. • the cable I’m using to connect the LED lights to the outlet. The LEDs are connected using a 5.5 × 2.1 mm (5521) to male cigarette lighter cable. This cable works in other setups and outlets, but I’m wondering if there’s something about this specific outlet, connection, or voltage that’s preventing the lights from powering on.

      "content": "Sharing two pawns I made based on the Vermundian Soldiers we see roaming about. I shared the Fighter before, but the Mage one I completed just awhile ago. Took me awhile, but I'm quite happy with how they turned out. They are both low level and equipped with gear from the early game that I believe some Vermundian Soldiers use, but it's all fully upgraded so they should be able to handle even Battahl and Volcanic Island given the chance. Here are their \"specs\": ---- -Vernia Female Figther (level 21) Calm Inclination Skills: Burst Strike, Cloudward Slash, Hindsight Sweep, Full Moon Slash ID: 7RHJ1Z18M2H4 ---- -Baenlin Male Mage (level 20) Kindhearted Inclination Skills: High Halidom, High Celerity, High Palladium, Lightning Affinity ID: JLC5D7QYUXX4 (Vermundian mages usually only cast Flagration and Fire Boon, but I don't think that would make a very fun pawn to have around, so I gave him some different skills). ---- If anyone fancies having some Vermundian soldiers for pawns, here they are. In case you hire any of them, hope it's to your liking! I also want to, eventually, create an Archer Vermundian Pawn, but creating these, even with the help of a late game safe file, is a bit time consuming, so maybe an idea for another time. In any case, if you feel I can improve them in any way, I'm open to suggestions too. Cheers! submitted by /u/m8-wutisdis to r/DragonsDogma2 [link] [comments]",

I'm talking about youtube content creators that play tons of games and highlight the best parts. They have not only a love for playing games, that many of us do, but also of sharing and building community around it. They are a crucial part for games to get out there in hands of people that may like them. When I reached out to them, they were more than helpful, kind and appreciative.

Now normally I wouldnt even be mad and sad cuz it's just a game, but those pets were all gifts that my girlfriend made to me. She sacrificed many pets in her account, even things she loved Just for getting me some pets i likes. And now, all my pets, all her sacrifices: GONE. I dont even know this guy/girl. I dont even remember playing with him in a server. I dont even wake up at 6 AM, I wake up a 7 AM. Now i feel mad, and sad, and most of all, i feel like i broke a promise, and despite all the times She told me \"it's not your fault\", i still think it's my fault. Maybe if i decided to login earlier something would've changed. Maybe if i decided to transfer my pets to another account this could've been avoided. I Hope that my report will be seen and that this story will be ready, and that this scum of a human being Will be banned, over and over and over and over and over. Thank you for your time. -Qbic (AKA Fakeranni) (NOTE: I never asked her for pets, She just gave them to me, not even knowing if i wanted them or not, and this makes me even more mad.

      "content": "There seems to be an obsession with adding online multiplayer to every game. At this point, it feels like every game is expected to have online features, but honestly, I think a lot of players struggle to find people to play with, and many of us don’t want to sit in a lobby listening to a horde of screaming kids. Making VR games is already difficult for indie devs, and supporting online multiplayer makes it even harder, and most importantly, it often results in less overall content. I could give many examples, but take Battle Talent for instance. It’s one of my favorite VR games: it has tons of systems, lots of enemy types, lots of weapons, etc. The devs have been pushing updates for a long time, which is great, and those updates are genuinely impressive. But over the past year they’ve been focusing heavily on online features, and personally I lost interest, while still thinking adding more core content could really transform this indie title into something totally unmatched in VR. Another example is Undead Citadel, which had a relatively lukewarm launch. Many people were disappointed by the amount of contents (not the gameplay itself), and now it looks like the team is working on a “multiplayer update.” Honestly, I just hope they add more than multiplayer (and from what I’ve seen, it seems they will). Online play, sandbox modes, mod support… all of that is nice to have. But to me, it’s more like the icing on the cake, not the cake itself. How do you guys feel? Is it just me coping because I have no friends, or do you also miss content-heavy single-player games? submitted by /u/Enculin to r/VRGaming [link] [comments]",

I'd like to avoid this. My first instinct would be to put an underscore before the parameter, e.g.: func _init(_character: Character) -> void: character = _character But, using an underscore on a parameter is the indicator to Godot to ignore unused parameters... so I don't want to use an underscore here. My next instinct would be to put a $ before the parameter, e.g.: ``` This is NOT valid code func _init($character: Character) -> void: character = $character ``` But $ have a special meaning in Godot and are not valid characters in a parameter name. Unfortunately, the official style guide also doesn't mention anything about this. Anyone have any clever, clean, universal approaches to this problem? submitted by /u/samanime [link] [comments]",

      "content": "I’ve always found this take that Luka would have multiple rings if he was on the Celtics to be flawed for many reasons: Preventing player development: Luka Doncic, a player that’s very ball dominant would likely mean the Celtics guard duo of Derrick White and Payton Pritchard wouldn’t have been able to develop into the players they are today because of Luka’s usage rate. Defensive liability: The Celtics built their championship team around the idea that their starting 5 players could switch onto an opposing player and defend them to a decent degree. With Luka on the court teams would have an immediate weak link to hunt on offense. Disrupts the Celtics balanced attack: The Celtics championship run consisted of multiple players that could get 20 points a game and with Luka’s usage you would’ve definitely seen less games where Porzingis or Jrue would’ve been able to showcase their offensive talent. It would’ve also made the five-out offense less reliable as most of the three-point shot attempts would be coming from one guy making the Celtics a more predictable team. This is further shown by the struggles he had playing with Porzingis. Similarly, would Jalen Brunson take the jump to the next level if he was still playing with the mavericks and Luka. This is not me arguing that Jayson Tatum could’ve taken Luka’s 2024 mavericks to the finals but I believe people often try to use this argument to prove that one player only wins because of their roster rather than understand how a player is able to fit and adapt to a system which matters more in determining the success they’d have on that team. submitted by /u/Majestic-Web-367 to r/NBATalk [link] [comments]",

That’s insane. The little fuckers are impossible because only dismemberment seems to do the job, but given most weapons at man-at-arms and above are focussed on bludgeoning - this becomes an absolute chore. Not to mention even when all their bones are broken and they’re just lying there, they still don’t count as a kill, even if they can’t get up or do anything. This, on top of the fact that the larger weapons all feel like wiffle bats and are terrible at cutting now - makes the abyss by far the worst part of the game. What are your opinions on the abyss?

You can use cnfans links directly on Hipobuy without converting them, and cnfans spreadsheets seem to work fine too. The whole site just feels smoother and more reliable overall.

Problem is, I have zero industry contacts and honestly, no time or interest in becoming a marketing expert. I just want to write and build. In 2026, is it still possible to get visibility for a high concept narrative game based solely on the quality of the 'Hook' and the story?

      "content": "In episode 16 of Gnosia, Remnan worries about being caught running away unlawfully and being captured if the D.Q.O. goes to a base. I've finished the game too, so I know that in it, his concern is rather about having to \"see\" someone. I'm curious about any theories/reasoning for the reasons for his concern in the anime. Is running away unlawfully really that big of a concern? Even if he left a planet without going through the correct process, this is because he escaped slavery. Wouldn't an exception be made? Or is he simply worried about the process of having to clarify this? Alternatively, if he ran away illegally, this could imply that slavery is legal in Gnosia, or has different legalities depending on the planet. However, I always figured Manan kept Remnan secret from anyone outside of her trusted circle. In the game, his worry about having to see someone is very vague, but from his events and general demeanor, the player is naturally made to think about Manan. It would make sense that, if he reported to a military base, she could possibly find out and track him down, at least in his POV. What do you all think? I'm open to discussion regarding this. Either way, it was nice to finally have a Remnan and Raqio moment adapted to the anime. submitted by /u/proboty to r/Gnosia_ [link] [comments]",

I've been developing a game for a few weeks now and releasing regular free, playable versions (though they're pretty rudimentary) and promoting them on x and bsky. I'm getting some engagement on both platforms, but so far nobody has downloaded my game to play. I'm honestly not expecting in-depth analysis of the game or anything, just some basic stuff like \"it feels slow\" or \"it's frustrating\" would be helpful. Or even just to catch bugs I may have missed. I understand asking someone to download and run an exe from a stranger on social media is a big ask, so is there a better place to ask for that kind of thing? Can I host my dev builds somewhere more trustworthy than a google drive link, distributed via a discord server? submitted by /u/Cudabear to r/gamedev [link] [comments]",

No matter what settings I use there's this ghosting on the item I'm holding and everything becomes blurry whenever I move and it's making me dizzy and hurting my eyes. The only time the ghosting and blur when moving is gone is when I use FXAA. But now I have a new problem where everything is too sharp. The clip I uploaded is just me showing the blur and ghosting I'm talking about but I've tried doing dlss on and off, full screen, windowed etc. I tried limiting fps, turning the motion blur on and off, global illumination on and off, going from low to ultra settings. But nothing changes. It's still blurry and has that ghosting effect except for when I use fxaa which makes everything too sharp and still makes my eyes hurt. Outside the settings I've also tried the compatability mode I've seen people suggesting in the forums but still it has this same effect. I tried searching for solutions but not much people seem to be having the same issues as me. Thank you for the help in advance.

Any advice on the difference between these 2?Exactly the same specs so I guess it comes down to MOBO, BIOS etc. The optional external liquid cooling for Erazer is tempting, but I know HP is super reliable (upgrading from an Omen 17 2060 which has lasted amazingly well with no issues since 2019). submitted by /u/Maxijak1 to r/GamingLaptops [link] [comments]",

      "content": "I'm not super knowledgeable on Godot so I apologize if this comes off silly. I'm currently making a pool game and I'm trying to make it so that the game will show your ball's trajectory, and if it collided with a ball it'll show the direction of where the hit ball would go. Originally I tried getting the direction like this but it wasn't super accurate var target_direction = (hit_position - self.global_position).normalized() bounce_line_2d.add_point(collider.global_position) bounce_line_2d.add_point(hit_position + target_direction * 200) Using the normal is closer but still inaccurate if shape_cast_2d.is_colliding(): var hit_position = shape_cast_2d.get_collision_point(0) var normal = shape_cast_2d.get_collision_normal(0) var collider = shape_cast_2d.get_collider(0) trajectory_line_2d.add_point(self.global_position) trajectory_line_2d.add_point(hit_position) collision_preview.global_position = hit_position collision_preview.visible = true if collider.is_in_group(\"balls\"): var target_direction = -normal bounce_line_2d.add_point(collider.global_position) bounce_line_2d.add_point(collider.global_position + target_direction * 200) The balls are rigid bodies and to detect collision im using a shape cast that's the same size as the ball. If anyone has any insight on this please let me know I'd greatly appreciate it. submitted by /u/_Abox [link] [comments]",

I’ve been recording and mixing for a while now (I can track 10+ live instruments in my studio), but I’m looking to diversify my portfolio specifically in the indie game and media world. Since I’m focused on building a solid \"reference list\" right now, I’m offering high-quality mix and mastering services at a very flexible/entry-level budget. Whether it’s a single track, a podcast, or game SFX, I’d love to help your project sound professional. I’m obsessed with getting that \"punchy\" sound right. If you have something that needs a professional touch without the high studio costs, let's chat! Cheers! submitted by /u/selcukhantras to r/Music [link] [comments]",

There are plenty of things they could do or could've done to prevent this but it's more than obvious they had no intentions of saving this game otherwise we'd have seen that effort. submitted by /u/PhotosByZane to r/OnePunchManWorldGame [link] [comments]",

Frankly, I don't see any other game series that would be so good and so frequent with their releases (although frequent releases arguably became an issue lately, but still) You may consider it a toxic positivity, but I'm aware of all the flaws of the series for the past six or so months, and I don't like any of that as well. It's just that RGG Studio is still the best dev team in my eyes, as they have set the bar quite high, hence I'm still excited for new releases How do you feel about Yakuza series regardless of its state right now?

However I noticed with the \"process call : physics\" my character was not having problems but the other elements moving (the cars in this case) were jittering a little when my character (thus the camera) were moving. When I put the process call to Idle, my character was jittering since I use the physics process, but the cars werent. Is there a way to fix the issue other than using physics process on the cars since they don't really need physics ? Thank you ! https://preview.redd.it/2m213jiyyxgg1.png?width=961&format=png&auto=webp&s=d888b3e09ee74d240d79cec68e8cf3c86db051fc https://reddit.com/link/1qt9li8/video/fpmo37uuyxgg1/player submitted by /u/Xayou [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Idk who needs to hear this but: I know we all roll our eyes at the “I can fix him” thing when it comes to women trying to rehabilitate toxic men, but I think a lot of us are still susceptible to the notion that if we just love our female or nb partners hard enough they will finally, eventually treat us right. …Sorry to say but, they probably won’t. If your partner consistently does things that hurt you or make you feel insecure or undervalued, *love will not change them.* If your gut tells you they’re maybe just kind of with you until they find someone “better,” you cannot love them into loving you fully. If they rant to you about how horrible all their ex partners & friends are — *you are not a break in the cycle, you’re just on the next loop-de-loop* — If it’s that many people, it’s not their exes, it’s not you: it’s them. I know we all want to believe that people can change, and trust me - I know how difficult it is to cut the cord when someone alternates hurtful behavior with lovebombing - when you keep seeing flashes of the person you wish they’d be. That’s often enough to keep people trapped in bad relationships for years. But if any part of this resonates with you, please try to take it to heart that you deserve better. You have to be a kind and patient person in order to want to help “fix” a broken person, but you may be breaking yourself in the process without even realizing it. You’re not a bad person for walking away from a toxic situation. I promise there is a better relationship out there, with someone who will actually appreciate and return the love and kindness you are currently pouring into ((whoever they are)) submitted by /u/uta_refson to r/actuallesbians [link] [comments]",

Rule #1 - only 1 suggestion per person and comment Rule #2 - no downvoting Rule #3 - we won't limited ourselves to just clowns, jesters, mimes and the like are all welcome Rule #4 - NO HORROR OR KILLER CLOWNS!!! Rule #5 - with your suggestion, make sure you add their name and franchise they're from (you'll get a bonus upvotes if you include an image or gif) Rule #6 - evil clowns, are welcome, however! if you want to add an evil clown, make sure to ask yourself \"why are they a clown?\" do they like to perform? do they like to make others laugh? do they enjoy smiling? Rule #7 - a friendly clown is always welcome, even if their reason for being a clown is questionable Rule #8 - groups are welcome, just make sure that the group itself has an official name Rule #9 - if there's a tie, a wheel will be spun (yesterday, Keheheh Kekerakera and Piedmon had the same amount of votes) Rule #10 - fan made clowns aren't allowed ---------- side note: everytime I mention clown in the rules, I also mean jesters and mimes tip: this entire roster idea, is based on the video, \"Top Ten Video Game Clowns\" by The Green Scorpion, so you can watch that video to get a better idea submitted by /u/MinimumPotential6468 to r/createaroster [link] [comments]",

This is what happens when you grew up in 80s NYC clubs: Area, The Tunnel, Visage, The Palladium - - - and you refuse to settle for algorithmic bullshit. This is me spanning 50 YEARS of music (yes, fifty) because I'm genre agnostic and I don't care what decade it came from if it makes me FEEL like a woman, not a demographic. You won't find force-fed \"empowerment anthems\" here, no drunk-girl-screaming playlist everyone makes, nothing that sounds like it came from a focus group. What you WILL find is Blondie's \"Call Me\" from 1980 sitting right next to Peggy Gou's \"(It Goes Like) Nanana\" from 2023. You'll find Basia -- BASIA, because who the heck remembers her? I do. You'll find Laufey's \"From The Start\" making you swoon before Purple Disco Machine makes you move. Grace Jones, Donna Summer, CHIC—the queens who taught the game. WAR and Earth, Wind & Fire because sometimes you need funk, not feelings. Chappell Roan and RAYE because good music doesn't have an expiration date. This playlist is for the women who know that Fleetwood Mac's \"Everywhere\" from 1987 still hits you different every time, who can dance to Sheila B. Devotion's French disco , who appreciate that Lianne La Havas and Jessie Ware exist, who remember when Madonna made music that mattered, who understand that Dua Lipa's \"Levitating\" belongs right next to Michael Jackson's \"Rock With You.\" This isn't a nostalgia trip and it's not a \"new music\" playlist.

While I did put good time into it, I positively do not want to even look at it anymore, it is like a child I am ashamed of. Anyways now I just kinda sit here with a blank unity project thinking \"what next?\". I want to make something small so enough I can finish but not too long that I lose interest. Any suggestions for getting started or workflow? submitted by /u/zueM [link] [comments]",

I am wanting to play something that isn't the lightest wargame in the world but would be alright for someone interested in strategy but new to the concept. I really want to get 2 sets of travel battle and combine them to make a 40 inch length 10 inch depth field of battle, since it works for my space. My question is, I understand that the native rulesets are very light, and that it is the rules that really make the war game and not the pieces. What, if any, are good, but not grognard complex, rulesets appliable to travel battle and this scale?

Even though it's early access, it's an amazing game that seriously has infinite potential. As someone that has loved playing games all his life and never had anything giving me the feeling that Skyrim and Minecraft gave me back in the day, Hytale comes pretty darn close. In fact it is so good, I really want to put my life into its progression! I started to learn coding/ modding a bit, created the first 2-3 mob/npc designs with animations and already created several Al's for ingame behaviour. Sadly I have no qualifications on paper whatsoever, only my work that's been done. Does anyone know, how the Hytale/ Hypixel team could see me? I have infinite ideas, infinite time and an infinite desire for this project. Even though I am nothing special obviously. I don't even need nearly the salary they promised to employees, I'd be happy with less than half of what people earn there. Just want to be a part of something amazing for once I'll add pictures of the creations below, I made them completely from 0, no templates, no help. (Please keep in mind, I started modding, designing, blockbench and animating on blockbench 3 days ago..)

As we journey through life, it's crucial to have a roadmap and milestones to guide us toward success. This month, we're drawing inspiration from the book that has sparked many transformative journeys - \"The One Thing\" by Gary Keller and Jay Papasan. ​ **The Power of Focusing on \"The One Thing\"** ​ In \"The One Thing,\" Keller and Papasan emphasize the importance of clarity, focus, and prioritization when it comes to achieving your goals. They advocate for finding that \"one thing\" that, when accomplished, will make everything else easier or unnecessary. This concept can be a game-changer in our quest for success. ​ **Monthly Challenge: Define Your \"One Thing\"** ​ Here's our challenge for this month: Take some time to reflect on your goals, whether they're related to your career, personal life, or health. What is that one thing that, if accomplished, would have the most significant positive impact on your journey? ​ - Write it down. - Break it into actionable steps. - Create a timeline. ​ By doing this, you'll have a clear, actionable plan for moving closer to your goals, step by step. ​ **Share Your Insights** ​ We encourage you to share your thoughts, experiences, and progress throughout the month. Have you read \"The One Thing,\" and if so, how has it influenced your approach to goal-setting and achievement? ​ Remember, every journey begins with a single step. Let's take those steps together and support each other in making our dreams a reality. 🚀💪 ​ Stay tuned for more inspiration and motivation as we work toward our \"one thing\" this month! submitted by /u/AutoModerator to r/MarketingOneZeroOne [link] [comments]",

I already finished the game and unlocked the Goat content. However, in the in-game tarot list it still shows 66 out of 85 tarot cards, and the trophy for collecting all tarot cards hasn’t unlocked yet. There os no ??? Card slot, all show some tarot card. I’m playing the base version from PS Plus (no DLC purchased). I dont known what I missing. Maybe some specific tarot cards that have special unlock condition. I’m also missing the last two follower forms in the list, I’d really appreciate clarification where to get them. At this point I just want to make sure: What exactly counts toward the 85 tarot cards? What cards até mandadory for the trophie? Is there any known PS5 / PS Plus version issue I should know about? Any guidance would be hugely appreciated — I’m so close to the platinum and don’t want to miss it before the game leaves PS Plus.

I mean every Call of Duty or Battlefield, Medal of Honor or other current shooters can be seen in so many different YouTube compilations that show how sound effects always vary a bit from sequel to sequel - even if is the same weapon type. But why? Is it a copyrights thing, is it for the sake of the sound designer's creative approach to always make new alternative sounds for every follow-up of a shooter game? Has this topic been discussed anywhere or is there a documentary about it? What do you think why this is?

It's a slightly different backroom than usual: the levels, some of which are very similar to those of Backrooms' creepypasta, but others have never been seen but imagined by me or inspired by movies and series or events that actually happened. It's a horror platformer, inspired, you have to look for keys and take coins (the latter is currently a beta), with monsters or levels where you have to overcome some platforms or with puzzles and much more. It's still in early access, but I'd like to make it perfect, and that's why it's in early access, so I'll listen to advice and improvements. The game currently has 10 levels, but I estimate that it will reach 50 or a maximum of 100 levels. Also, for now, the game is in single-player, but I'm already working on multiplayer. I'm also working on a new mode that will be one of the few backroom games that allow you to do this, I don't want to do spoilers, but it will be cool and I want to create a real community about my backroom game. I'll give you a preview of the first level, I want to assure you that this game is a platformer, but it's not just a platformer, we'll also have to solve puzzles, run away from monsters and much more, because I don't want a static game that's dynamic and full of things and choices.

      "content": "I have played so many shooters over the last 30 years that I find it fascinating how often the sound designers tend to create always variations of a gun shot sound effect for firing a gun of a specific type (like an AK47 or Glock). I mean every Call of Duty or Battlefield, Medal of Honor or other current shooters can be seen in so many different YouTube compilations that show how sound effects always vary a bit from sequel to sequel - even if is the same weapon type. But why? Is it a copyrights thing, is it for the sake of the sound designer's creative approach to always make new alternative sounds for every follow-up of a shooter game? Has this topic been discussed anywhere or is there a documentary about it? What do you think why this is? I find it highly fascinating how you can see AK47s in 10 different games and each one sounds slightly different. submitted by /u/GAME-PHYSICS-by-DNMN to r/gamedev [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Hi, I’m currently working on a ghost function. In my game, the player only moves along one axis (X). What I’ve done is: on Tick, I store the X location each frame in a float array. Then I load that back on the next run. What I’ve noticed is that if the FPS drops in the first round, then the playback won’t be accurate on the second. I’m pretty sure this is because Tick is FPS-dependent. So I’m wondering: is there any way to do some sort of multi-threaded tick that runs independently from FPS? Is “Set Timer by Event” the same as Tick, or would that solve my problem? Or would it help if I only stored the X value every half a second (like calling it every 0.5s)? submitted by /u/Efficient-Regular-30 [link] [comments]",

My problem with most of them is that they are goals, but they are given in the form of advice, like \"put your own needs first\", \"learn to say no\", \"set boundaries\", \"learn about who you are and what you want\", \"focus on yourself\", etc. I hear these and some other ones a LOT and they already make me feel horrible for not being capable of doing them. I haven't gone a full week without shutting down for days, there's absolutely no way I can take care of myself or do basic household chores (or even get up and walk to the bathroom). I'd just be doing chores in a terrible state, with nothing changing, eventually feeling worse. \"Put your own needs first\" is a good goal, but actually doing that leads to more small traumas for me. Absolutely none of these do anything for me. I feel like the emptiness has taken over too much. I've never been able to function. I saw an EMDR therapist for the first time today (just the assessment) and we're starting the work in 2 weeks. I shut down as soon as I got home for unrelated reasons (people in uni). I need something to WORK and make me feel a little better until I see some results from EMDR. submitted by /u/Voroojac to r/emotionalneglect [link] [comments]",

New Vegas is basically supposed to be the Wild West so why would you live in there and want to be bossed around and taxed by some jarhead liberals? Do you even need the protection/extortion? The Mojave is full of extremely powerful guns basically lying around everywhere in the open. You do not need soldiers to protect you. The NCR npcs are also extremely annoying and aggressive and demand you submit to their fake government authority. At least The Enclave are actually descendants of the original USA government. They have a sort of more legitimate authority even if it is evil. NCR on the other hand are just some libs from California who all of the sudden decided they have a right to rule the entire wasteland. Who made you God? I don’t think anyone voted for the NCR. The game shills them so hard even the devs wore NCR shirts at E3. NCR is obviously a self insert of the devs WOKE libtard ideology and if you choose not to side with them you will have EVIL karma. “Oh but what about the Legion? They are more evil so you have to side with the NCR.” Exactly the same logic the fake left uses to just supporting the democrats every single election. At least the Legion is trying something different from the same ideology that destroyed the entire planet. “but the legion r fascist!!!!1” Oh and NCR are not? Nope NCR are just as much fascist Nazis. They want to bring back the same imperialism usa does. Also it’s clear the devs made the Legion as comically evil as possible to try and force you into supporting the NCR. Nice try libtards. I always side with the Legion anyway. It is more fun to LARP as Juba the Sniper and pwn imperialist NCR skkkum. Now on a another note aesthetically they are also objectively the worst faction. Their uniforms look absolutely hideous. Also forgot to mention Boone is such an overrated and terrible character. He is basically Chris Kyle The American Sniper. A pathetic emo who never shuts up about his stupid wife. lol so edgy, cringe, gross, hateful and vengeful nasty character. He tries to portray himself as some sort of poor ptsd vet hurt by war yet he obviously is a psychopath who just loves violence and killing. Like if you were so morally good you wouldn’t choose to be a sniper merc and follow the courier around killing as many people as possible. This is a character made for people who have a punisher skull on their F150. Boone SUCKS. There are absolutely no redeeming qualities whatsoever about the NCR they are the worst faction to side with for the wasteland. The only faction that comes close to being as bad is the Followers of The Apocalypse who are basically like IRL radlib anarchists who shill for the NCR/Democrat party. The Followers are basically useful idiots for the NCR and do everything they want. WOKE libtard nazis DESTROYED with FACTS and LOGIC. submitted by /u/Sweet-Ad-7887 to r/TrueAnon [link] [comments]",

      "content": "My game features 1 scene of consensual choking where a person asks to be choked. Since my game has been released UK law has changed or is changing to ban depictions of choking. Steam are no longer letting adult games update after their release. This means you cannot go in and change content that isn't bug-fixes. Their justification is that they have to review adult games to ensure they are compliant. Devs could sneak in non-compliant stuff through updates. My problem is that I'm not being permitted to remove the choking scene from my game which could break UK law. What am I supposed to do here? Do I really have to take my whole game off Steam? Am I liable to get in trouble over something I produced before the law changed? If I remove my game from Steam I'm going to be losing tens of thousands of dollars in sales. submitted by /u/IllUniversity9595 to r/LegalAdviceUK [link] [comments]",

What we’re suggesting is not “ unnecessary” it’s the bare minimum for realistic college football equipment in 2026. And before anybody starts crying “gameplay first” we AGREE. Gameplay glitches need to be fixed and on field gameplay should be elite. But let’s stop acting like it’s one or the other. EA uses different dev teams for different aspects of the game. The people working on gameplay aren’t the same ones handling player models, uniforms, accessories, and customization. Both can be improved. It’s honestly weird how some of y’all think immersive customization “takes away” from the game. Nobody trashes gameplay suggestions so why force hate on customization requests? It makes no sense. If you want your players wearing outdated or basic gear, cool. That option will still be there. But what’s wrong with letting the people who actually care about customization have the freedom to use newer, more realistic options? Choice doesn’t hurt anyone it only makes the game better. Right now we can’t even equip half the stuff real college athletes wear every Saturday. In a game that’s supposed to be a realistic college football experience, that’s unacceptable.

      "content": "I have been developing a single player offline fitness game for Iphone were you level up by walking in real life. My game functions alot differently than the other options currently as it is casual freindly. It's probably similiar to Melvor Idle. Im going to be having an open beta soon join WalkWorld for more info . Features: 5 skills (2.5 million steps worth of content which will always be free) Should work with Apple watches immediately (reads Apple Healthkit for step data) Inventory, leveling, and progression similiar to Runescape No inventory limit, no traveling, and you spend steps like a currency after your walk. Feedback appreciated. https://preview.redd.it/ig73l2gz9bhg1.png?width=323&format=png&auto=webp&s=ef38d40a13535f13cf300f3f8c9ac7becbae596e https://preview.redd.it/zpf5fax0abhg1.png?width=322&format=png&auto=webp&s=3d8ed9638bd58a8e8a5c75b82c3ddbe76e8bf456 https://preview.redd.it/uvxxvsu1abhg1.png?width=327&format=png&auto=webp&s=f625571251114c0810242c4fe7d9ca10d0ae3111 submitted by /u/GreenWizard56 [link] [comments]",

People here often criticize others for wanting better graphics, saying the graphics are “fine.” I’d be totally fine with that if they actually added anything else that was meaningful. Road to the Show, Franchise, Stadium Creator, etc. have been stagnant for years. What exactly are the devs spending their time on? Adding a few Diamond Dynasty cards and college teams? Is that really it? I would be more than happy to accept a trade-off of better graphics in exchange for fewer new features, or new features at the expense of graphics. The problem is we’re getting neither. They’re a business. They obviously want to maximize profits. So stop rewarding them with your $80 for what is essentially a roster update. submitted by /u/Remote_Plastic_8692 to r/MLBTheShow [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Hey everyone, we’re a small indie team working on a grim dark roguelike, and we’re getting close to our vertical slice. Which is exciting, but also the moment where every decision starts to feel permanent… and slightly terrifying. Before locking ourselves into choices we might regret later, we put together a short survey to get some outside perspective. It touches things like difficulty, punishment, narrative weight, atmosphere, and also the less fun but very real side of indie dev like marketing, discovery, and why players actually trust or wishlist a game. We don’t have a publisher or safety net, so this kind of feedback genuinely helps us avoid shooting ourselves in the foot. The survey is in English, anonymous, and doesn’t take forever. Link here: https://bewdbros.studio/forms/helpusbuildourgame If you feel like helping a fellow indie team make slightly fewer bad decisions, we’d really appreciate it. And if anything interesting comes out of it, we’re happy to share what we learned. Thanks, and good luck surviving your own vertical slice.

I am making a Qi2 Wireless Car Charger to replace the current wireless charger in my car. Since most smartphones nowadays have a large camera bump, I wanted to have a plate that will be pushed down when the phones camera bump is pressed on it, and pushed back up when the phone is removed. The reason I'm posting is because I want to figure out a way to lock the plate in place when the wireless charger is off. This is a nice-to-have since this way, if the wireless charger is off, the plate being locked allows the user to place whatever coins, car keys, or whatever on there without the plate sinking down. I need some kind of electrical mechanical mechanism for this, but I wasn't sure what would be the best one for the job. My first thought was servo motors, but I wanted to ask else I should consider using if I didn't or couldn't use a servo motor. submitted by /u/ThePeacefulOne to r/MechanicalEngineering [link] [comments]",

I had been interested in starting a game development side project for a few months and had recently built a flappy bird clone in Unity. Then I saw a tutorial series on youtube by HeartBeast about creating an ARPG in Godot 3. After watching that amazing series I decided to choose Godot as the engine. We started developing the game on Godot 4.2 and upgraded to 4.3 and then 4.4 which is what we are currently using. Our studio consists of one full time developer (myself, the founder), a part time developer (my co-founder) as well as a few of our friends who helped with ideas, play testing and some world design. The art assets we used were all sourced from asset packs or commissioned from artists found on Reddit/Itch/Fiverr/Youtube. If you enjoy games like Classic World of Warcraft or Diablo and enjoy pixel art aesthetics then check out our store page!

      "content": "Hello guys, So my current setup is that I have an animation one shot that as the in parameter has the locomotion blend tree and as the shot parameter an animation state machine. The state machine is used to make the following actions for example: Jump -> Fall-> Land or Jump -> Fall -> Idle (If fallen from low height). My problem is that in the animation state machine, I have the transition from Fall directly to End of the state machine and it has a condition \"ended\" that i set true when in the Fall animation which is looping i want to immediately end the animation to get back to the locomotion. The condition is then reset to false when the animation state machine gets to the End node using the state_entered signal. But then, when adding an Xfade time to the transition, the character seems to have a delay based on the time put there before going back to the locomotion blend tree. Has anyone ever encountered the same problem as me and fixed it?

The buffs don't seem that impactful, and I don't think the game is very generous with skillpoints either to have players waste a turn just to fix this second HP bar. I'm also not sure how I feel about the specificity of guides. Like, in other games, it's usually more of a system where they are separated based on their class, and then designed to synergize with their intended holder, while others can still make use of them. But here, they just completely remove a guide's passive if you don't match them. I know story-wise they are couples with the esper, but it feels a bit weird. And then I pull a 5\\ guide, and then suddenly I feel pressured to get the esper because its just a guiding effect and a stat stick without them?)

We can hold hands (like I do with all my friends) and hang out and support each other through life without kissing or weird feelings or other gross stuff.
