      "content": "I broke up with my boyfriend 151 days ago. It was not a healthy relationship for both of us and he treated me poorly however I wasn’t much better than he was — although I personally feel he was significantly worse. Since then, I hopped around guys assuming that would let me forget him and move on because if he was out of sight, he was out of mind. But it truthfully has made my mental health worse. I have lost my romantic touch everywhere, and I am someone who has always loved love. I can’t imagine myself in a relationship, I can’t even try to look for other people. I see good looking guys but the thought of being with them makes me nauseous and timid — something I’ve never had to deal with before. I’ve been in contact with my ex for the last month and a half. It’s been good. He’s been good. We hooked up twice, more so because we have and had really good chemistry all around — he knows me, I know him. We talked about us, but we agreed we couldn’t be together right now — also because he needs to catch up in body counts to consider dating me. But I can’t shake this feeling that we just aren’t going to work out at all. Now or in the future. I want him, but not him . I want how he knows me and loves me and fucks me in a different guy. I can’t look at him and consider him without thinking about what I’ve done to him and how he treated me before. I have an appointment with my doctor next week to talk about antidepressants because I have genuinely never felt lower in life, not even when my mom was in the hospital twice in the same week. Unlike most people with depression (stereotypically), I look forward to my uni classes because that’s all I have right now. I am going to talk to my dad about it I think this weekend as he has always been there for me and deserves to know. submitted by /u/Fickle-Tomorrow-5575 to r/depression [link] [comments]",

The dev loses the money and pays the chargeback fee, while the keys are still out there What are the best ways to protect yourself from this as an indie dev? Any proven practices (platform choices, key distribution rules, verification, etc.) - especially when selling keys directly (outside of Steam) or distributing keys to influencers/press? Which platforms/payment processors are the safest? Any rules you follow when giving out keys? Is this mostly unavoidable and just needs to be \"priced in\"? I'd really appreciate any insight.

This week, we’ve been focusing on the items you can equip to support the heroes during combat. The idea is that they offer small advantages without overpowering the deck or the turn-based strategy. Nothing final yet — we’re still iterating on how they should look and how much personality they should have without getting in the way of readability. Always open to feedback from other devs, especially around visual clarity, utility, and presentation. Thanks for taking a look! submitted by /u/Champion_of_Lore [link] [comments]",

I know the music would be up my alley no matter the lineup, but I have some questions about the festival culture before I make a final call. 1. Is it easy to socialize/make friends as a solo festival-goer or is it more couples and families? 2. What is there to do besides the music? Are there activities without an added cost? 3. Is it worth it to do one of the curated meals as someone into food? Is the food similar to a dinner of that price you'd get at a fine dining restaurant, or is it overpriced because it's at a music festival? And finally... 4. What's the vibe like in general?

Also I haven't figured out the game logic behind this when creating new fleets. For example: Fleet #4 Fleet #2 Fleet #1 Fleet #3 So instead of being able to drag and drop fleets in the UI, I am left with the option of MANUALLY transferring ships to a different fleet and just changing their name. I saw that it was a good idea to separate your picket ships and artillery ships with their own fleets but halfway through a play-through I just ended up making all of my fleets to be all-rounded which ended up having ship behavior that I did not desire. This is a noobie asking the community on their thoughts and possible advice. P.S.

      "content": "I feel like everyone around Teddy can see it but him. He’s really really messed up from his bad relationship with his dad, and he takes it out on everyone around him, like if anyone in the show needed a therapist, it was him… Taking ALL Of Franklin’s money was purely a power trip game, I had the exact same questions as Franklin, why did he take the whole 73, why didn’t he just leave him enough to transition, he WANTED Franklin to fuck his life, he could have left him even 10-20 mill. The way he justifies things are so warped, like talking about how “You left me Franklin”, as if Franklin had any choice about the fact that Louie went behind his back, and forced him out. Louie and Jerome would have done the work for Teddy if they didn’t have to go to war with Franklin. Like he can’t see how his actions might be what rubs people up the wrong way, instead he always says how “I can’t believe they’re behaving like this” and the behaviour is a very normal reaction to his cruel behaviour. And I think he gets this from his dad. Everything Teddy does, even the way he talks, it’s like he’s gotta make sure everyone knows “I’m the one in charge”, even proposing to Parissa seemed a bit premature. Teddy had daddy issues man…. submitted by /u/ArmzLDN to r/SnowFall [link] [comments]",

Basically, I understand what an idea's guy is and why it's a bad thing. It's just a guy who is stuck in the \"consumer\" mindset and has no plans of entering the \"producer\" mindset. They don't actually want to make a game, they just want someone else to make the game they want to play. This is someone you should call out. They'll probably be delusional forever if you don't actually give them a reality check. Games aren't made with wishes alone. Also, game development isn't this horrible thing you should avoid doing. They should be made to face their own self-doubt instead of hiding it behind their enthusiasm. I don't know because I have stopped making games a while. I couldn't actually get into it due to personal issues. It's just the flow the universe, it's not some evil thing. Making games should be fun. submitted by /u/Motherfucker29 [link] [comments]",

      "content": "I've been digging into classical Islamic rulings on slavery and it's left me genuinely confused. From what I understand: Quran 4:24 explicitly allows Muslim men to have sex with female captives/slaves (\"those your right hands possess\") even if those women were married before capture, the prior marriage gets overridden. Classical fiqh (across major schools) says the owner's sexual access to his female slave doesn't require her consent; refusal without \"valid excuse\" can make her disobedient and subject to discipline. Consent isn't treated as a legal requirement in the premodern texts, ownership itself makes it licit. Modern Muslims say slavery is abolished and these rules are historical, but the text itself permitted what we'd today call non-consensual sex with war captives (including married ones), which looks a lot like sexual coercion/rape by modern standards. So honest question: Does the fact that the Quran carves out these exceptions (without requiring consent) show an inherent misogyny or supremacist framework baked into the religion?

I've had this same issue with another mesh from a different seller so I guess its some importing shenanigans. Any ideas?

That silly concept slowly evolved into a full mobile game.

      "content": "The actual reality, people are too dumb to realize that legendary rarity doesn't matter more than gun effects... Also reality, quest rewards and unique items used to be legendary quality gear that was easily refarmable and had a 100% drop chance as it was a quest reward... Third reality, there's nowhere to reliably farm purple items in BL4. The world events should be this place as they are easy to spawn and are all mobbing content... The removal of unique items in BL4 is what starts the legendary grind and intensifies it, as they removed the alternative legendaries you got as quest rewards (uniques /blues-greens with legendary effects)... BL2 had pretty damn low drop rates for alot of items but guess what? Nobody cared because sandhawk, pimpernel, lady fist, fibber...i can easily keep going... Even BL3 had some unique items that were fire, they just got power creeped out of relevance therefore making the endless legendaries of BL3 the obvious better choice... If they actually had fire ass blue weapons as quest rewards then this whole legendary grind shit wouldn't even be such a big deal, but since legendaries are the only option now it *feels* like that's what you need to casual players.... Casuals aren't gonna be making DOT stellium builds or testing out new tech, which sucks because there's aloooot of insane purples in BL4 but it is what it is... I think since they've basically removed an entire section of legendaries by removing uniques, they need to compensate that automatically by having the legendary drop rate be way higher... This circles back to my original point that I made in a random comment days ago, but bl4 would benefit from bl3s legendary drop rate even better than that game did... At least that's my opinion...thoughts?... submitted by /u/WhoIsEnvy to r/Borderlands4 [link] [comments]",

If the players sit facing each other around the table, they'll have difficulty reading it (since it's upside down). This could also confuse them. I thought about making cards with the staff in both directions, but that would make the card too bulky (since it would be upside down, the card would have to be very large). I considered having the players sit side-by-side on the same side of the table, but that limits the number of players (otherwise their arms would be too short to reach the central draw pile). Do you have any other ideas? Thank you for your help. submitted by /u/Visual-Wave-9245 [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Whatever designer did this is an absolute moron. “wide open” means there is zero defensive pressure, and on top of that, there is no imminent defensive pressure. The shooter has all the time they need, and they know it. “open” means there is zero defensive pressure, although the defense is nearby. There might not be a hand in the shooters face, but there’s the threat of one on the way. “contested” means a defender is having SOME impact on the shot. Maybe their body just being a little too close for comfort would give you 5%; very makable. A hand darting towards your face, maybe 15%, and makable. Jumping with you during the layup and forcing you to use the rim to protect the shot? Maybe 25%, and you can still make it, tho a few might bounce off the rim or backboard awkwardly. Closing on you with hands up and getting uncomfortably close? Maybe 30%, and you’ll miss some shots. Shane Battier sticking your hand in Kobe‘s face? Maybe 85, and unless you are the 2k version of Kobe, it likely isn’t going in. I don’t know why this is so hard for the makers of this game. You can have low contests that don’t have a wild impact on shooting. Everything doesn’t have to be open. submitted by /u/TheLordAshram to r/NBA2k [link] [comments]",

      "content": "I used to spend days trying to rig and animate 3D models, tweaking bones, fixing weights, and re-exporting over and over. Half the time, the result still looked stiff or broken. Then i created a webapp that lets you upload a 3D model and instantly apply motion capture animations to it. No complex rigging, no messy setups, no learning curve. Now I can create animated 3D content in minutes instead of days, from formats like .glb, .obj, .stl.

That was lifted directly from vamp survivors with no real effort, and it shows. Probably also the reason why most of the modes allow you to select your full loadout before you start. No, what I was enjoying about the game was it's grindy little out of game progression. Collecting pets, and gear, and tech parts and all the other bits and bobs, and cleaning them up in my inventory. Merging in to better ones, basically playing invently zooma. But it's all held together by gameplay that, lets be honest, was never good, and the devs did nothing to make it better. So I was thinking, do you guys know other games with fun long term progression, but also primary gameplay loop that is not an afterthought? Oh, and I don't spend money on mobile games and use adblock dns, so f2p experience can't be held together by spamming ads. submitted by /u/myhv to r/AndroidGaming [link] [comments]",

They are the ones most often used in switches and the ones most likely to guard almost every position on the floor. They both play extremely hard and never take plays off. Kon especially for a rookie not only plays solid d but has understood right away all the hard to get stuff when it comes to switching, positioning, etc when running an nba defense.

Yes we won the first two games while chasing but the moment there is scoreboard pressure this batting lineup is completely falling apart. There is no intent no partnerships and wickets keep tumbling every few overs. What makes it even more frustrating is the decision making from the dugout. Sending Radha Yadav at number 5 is already a red flag and makes absolutely no sense while Georgia Voll sits on the bench despite being someone who can actually handle pressure and build an innings. Instead we persist with Linsey Smith who is clearly not required as there are multiple bowling options and I don’t understand what the coaching staff is thinking by not bowling Radha and not using an over or two by grace. They keep persisting with the same 11 and still keep losing wickets regularly. That is not Gujarat bowling something extraordinary that is RCB gifting them the game. Malolan has to take responsibility here because this is not a lack of talent issue it is about how that talent is being used and right now it feels like we are losing matches in the selection room rather than on the field. submitted by /u/cosmichero18 to r/RCB [link] [comments]",

      "content": "I was going through the Crystal Guardians set from 2006 the other day and reminiscing how cool it was Pokémon centered an entire set theme on Crystals. The Celebi gold star is of course a banger but there are a lot of cool cards in that set. The next set release Dragon Frontiers also was theme specific. Stacked with dragon pokemon. We actually got Charizard & Rayquaza in the same set! Unheard of nowadays. Now I know you can point to recent sets like Destined Rivals and 151 and say those have themes. Sure, but the themes are what I would consider abstract. I just wish Pokemon would return to making sets about something concrete. Like an awesome Dragon focused set. Instead we get an underwhelming Charizard-only release like Phantasmal Flames. I know everything has to tie into the video games anymore but you’d think they could do a better job of giving us solid theme releases. Instead of Abstract sets like Journey Together, Perfect Order, Twilight Masquerade, Temporal Forces, etc. It would be refreshing to see a return to a more vintage era focus on types of Pokemon and cool artwork. I also think it helps people understand the Pokemon universe better. So many newer people to the hobby have no idea what the types of Pokemon even are. They just know the name. Which undercuts a big chunk of the game and hobby itself. Types matter and bring a richness to the overall experience. That’s missing from modern releases and something I wish would return. submitted by /u/LegoRedBrick to u/LegoRedBrick [link] [comments]",

Today i was supposed to work at 6:30 am and from the outside looking in i had prepared efficiently for the work day ahead; except i couldn’t fall asleep. i was in my bed and my whole day (which was a good day; i drove myself to the park, treated myself to lunch, watched a movie, did laundry, showered, had therapy) was replying in my head in a form of song. There was music that filled my day at each step and things i did, and those songs were repeating in my head all night along with memories of the things i did; i saw. I called into to work because i did not sleep, i think the anxiety of work but also the anxiety that filled my day because it was soooooo busy lingered all night. I think i understand how even though the stress was “good” it still amp’d up my anxiety and made it difficult for me to sleep. Maybe because i liked my day so much i felt like i was buzzing all night? I never understood before that good feelings can affect my sleep in such a way; and even if i may feel sad about staying in the house all day and playing my fav video game, thats literally what i need to do to be able to do at least the day before i go back to work so i can sleep well enough. Hyperarousal and the delayed REM sleep that autism causes affects me in this way and ive just realized that. Im glad i know now. submitted by /u/Lenabugsss to r/AutismInWomen [link] [comments]",

Curious what you think of it. I guess there's a quiet a bit emphasis on the \"DO ask questions\" part, but that's mostly because most players I've played with just. won't. freaking. ask. any. questions. And it's infuriating to me that they never interact with pretty much half of the game, simply because they don't ask any questions and thus don't even know that it exists. Also, fyi, the last part is specific to my games. I usually tend to play homebrew games, and, while I have a general draft and timeline of events, I create maps and encounters in between sessions. So, If my player don't share their plans with me, and I prepare everything for Place A, only for them to decide they'll head to Place B, we'll have to cancel the sesssion, because I don't have anything ready for Place B, submitted by /u/FutureNo9445 to r/DnD [link] [comments]",
