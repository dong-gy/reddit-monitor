I can grind competitive for a bit, but eventually I get tilted or go on a losing streak or I want to practice a particular mechanic/style/strategy that's not ready for \"prime time\" without trashing my rank. So I grind casual. Often enough my teammate wants to ff, sometimes its like 50 seconds into the match because the score went from 2-1 to 2-2. I feel like if I ff I'm wasting time, I'm not gonna get better 1/5th of a game at a time, and I learn less if I only play the winning games to completion. Some games I end up in a lobby where everyone is a full rank higher than me (according to bakkes). These games are usually a blowout but there's a lot to learn. I don't want to forfeit but I feel kind of like a jerk for dragging my teammate through a losing game. And if I don't forfeit they start throwing, trash-talking, owngoaling etc. What would you guys do? Play through at the expense of your teammate?

      "content": "I am planning to make a turn based RPG game in unity, but the problem is i have not used unity(or any game engine) . The problem that i have encountered is that of how do i \"attack\", the thing is I already made the game in VS(C#) in console and it worked perfectly and my battle logic was: You have a maximum of 5 characters and the enemy also, for each turn i make a array of all the characters(enemy + player) and i sort it descending according to the \"initiative\" and according to this array is the \"turn order\" and when technicaly is your turn you just write 1,2,3,4,5 to select the ability then 1-5 to select the target. So back to unity, i thought that was done in \"update\" in my battleHandle-monobehaviour but did some research and also asked chat and came with the same answer : i need to make the buttons and on press to check the condition if i can attack(the condition is intuitive) BUT when the enemy attack it is done in update. Why is that, do I miss something ? Is this \"button\" that i can always press(but will not do anything if the \"state\" is not my turn) the way to go or to check in each frame ( in update) if the player had a input(if the state is player turn ofc, cuz i have 2 ifs \"if state==playerturn or if state==enemyturn) I am lost all help will be useful! submitted by /u/LunchLeast809 [link] [comments]",

      "content": "I broke up with my boyfriend 151 days ago. It was not a healthy relationship for both of us and he treated me poorly however I wasn’t much better than he was — although I personally feel he was significantly worse. Since then, I hopped around guys assuming that would let me forget him and move on because if he was out of sight, he was out of mind. But it truthfully has made my mental health worse. I have lost my romantic touch everywhere, and I am someone who has always loved love. I can’t imagine myself in a relationship, I can’t even try to look for other people. I see good looking guys but the thought of being with them makes me nauseous and timid — something I’ve never had to deal with before. I’ve been in contact with my ex for the last month and a half. It’s been good. He’s been good. We hooked up twice, more so because we have and had really good chemistry all around — he knows me, I know him. We talked about us, but we agreed we couldn’t be together right now — also because he needs to catch up in body counts to consider dating me. But I can’t shake this feeling that we just aren’t going to work out at all. Now or in the future. I want him, but not him . I want how he knows me and loves me and fucks me in a different guy. I can’t look at him and consider him without thinking about what I’ve done to him and how he treated me before. I have an appointment with my doctor next week to talk about antidepressants because I have genuinely never felt lower in life, not even when my mom was in the hospital twice in the same week. Unlike most people with depression (stereotypically), I look forward to my uni classes because that’s all I have right now. I am going to talk to my dad about it I think this weekend as he has always been there for me and deserves to know. submitted by /u/Fickle-Tomorrow-5575 to r/depression [link] [comments]",

Any proven practices (platform choices, key distribution rules, verification, etc.) - especially when selling keys directly (outside of Steam) or distributing keys to influencers/press? Which platforms/payment processors are the safest? Any rules you follow when giving out keys? Is this mostly unavoidable and just needs to be \"priced in\"? I'd really appreciate any insight.

I'll be in the area already after a family wedding, so I would definitely be arriving on Thursday if I went, might stay Thursday-Saturday or might stay the full weekend. I know the music would be up my alley no matter the lineup, but I have some questions about the festival culture before I make a final call. 1. Is it easy to socialize/make friends as a solo festival-goer or is it more couples and families? 2. What is there to do besides the music? Are there activities without an added cost? 3. Is it worth it to do one of the curated meals as someone into food? Is the food similar to a dinner of that price you'd get at a fine dining restaurant, or is it overpriced because it's at a music festival? And finally... 4. What's the vibe like in general?

Also I haven't figured out the game logic behind this when creating new fleets. For example: Fleet #4 Fleet #2 Fleet #1 Fleet #3 So instead of being able to drag and drop fleets in the UI, I am left with the option of MANUALLY transferring ships to a different fleet and just changing their name. I saw that it was a good idea to separate your picket ships and artillery ships with their own fleets but halfway through a play-through I just ended up making all of my fleets to be all-rounded which ended up having ship behavior that I did not desire. This is a noobie asking the community on their thoughts and possible advice. P.S.

They also say they provide a guarantee on all purchases. I think normal price is about 7-9 bucks on there so it’s a steal no matter what when compared to PSN price. Super fun game!

He’s really really messed up from his bad relationship with his dad, and he takes it out on everyone around him, like if anyone in the show needed a therapist, it was him… Taking ALL Of Franklin’s money was purely a power trip game, I had the exact same questions as Franklin, why did he take the whole 73, why didn’t he just leave him enough to transition, he WANTED Franklin to fuck his life, he could have left him even 10-20 mill. The way he justifies things are so warped, like talking about how “You left me Franklin”, as if Franklin had any choice about the fact that Louie went behind his back, and forced him out. Louie and Jerome would have done the work for Teddy if they didn’t have to go to war with Franklin. Like he can’t see how his actions might be what rubs people up the wrong way, instead he always says how “I can’t believe they’re behaving like this” and the behaviour is a very normal reaction to his cruel behaviour. And I think he gets this from his dad. Everything Teddy does, even the way he talks, it’s like he’s gotta make sure everyone knows “I’m the one in charge”, even proposing to Parissa seemed a bit premature.

They don't actually want to make a game, they just want someone else to make the game they want to play. This is someone you should call out. They'll probably be delusional forever if you don't actually give them a reality check. Games aren't made with wishes alone. Also, game development isn't this horrible thing you should avoid doing. They should be made to face their own self-doubt instead of hiding it behind their enthusiasm. I don't know because I have stopped making games a while.

      "content": "I've been digging into classical Islamic rulings on slavery and it's left me genuinely confused. From what I understand: Quran 4:24 explicitly allows Muslim men to have sex with female captives/slaves (\"those your right hands possess\") even if those women were married before capture, the prior marriage gets overridden. Classical fiqh (across major schools) says the owner's sexual access to his female slave doesn't require her consent; refusal without \"valid excuse\" can make her disobedient and subject to discipline. Consent isn't treated as a legal requirement in the premodern texts, ownership itself makes it licit. Modern Muslims say slavery is abolished and these rules are historical, but the text itself permitted what we'd today call non-consensual sex with war captives (including married ones), which looks a lot like sexual coercion/rape by modern standards. So honest question: Does the fact that the Quran carves out these exceptions (without requiring consent) show an inherent misogyny or supremacist framework baked into the religion?

You had to make yourself an account, kinda like in movie star planet and then you could go shopping on that big street where you could swipe to the right and there were more stores. It was 2d and had kind of a cool style. The characters didn’t have that cheap looking giant head style i think. I remember your character being kinda small but idk how much that helps. I think it had kind of a story to it and you had to unlock stuff but i’m not too sure anymore. I remember making many new accounts because I always forgot my login.

      "content": "The actual reality, people are too dumb to realize that legendary rarity doesn't matter more than gun effects... Also reality, quest rewards and unique items used to be legendary quality gear that was easily refarmable and had a 100% drop chance as it was a quest reward... Third reality, there's nowhere to reliably farm purple items in BL4. The world events should be this place as they are easy to spawn and are all mobbing content... The removal of unique items in BL4 is what starts the legendary grind and intensifies it, as they removed the alternative legendaries you got as quest rewards (uniques /blues-greens with legendary effects)... BL2 had pretty damn low drop rates for alot of items but guess what? Nobody cared because sandhawk, pimpernel, lady fist, fibber...i can easily keep going... Even BL3 had some unique items that were fire, they just got power creeped out of relevance therefore making the endless legendaries of BL3 the obvious better choice... If they actually had fire ass blue weapons as quest rewards then this whole legendary grind shit wouldn't even be such a big deal, but since legendaries are the only option now it *feels* like that's what you need to casual players.... Casuals aren't gonna be making DOT stellium builds or testing out new tech, which sucks because there's aloooot of insane purples in BL4 but it is what it is... I think since they've basically removed an entire section of legendaries by removing uniques, they need to compensate that automatically by having the legendary drop rate be way higher... This circles back to my original point that I made in a random comment days ago, but bl4 would benefit from bl3s legendary drop rate even better than that game did... At least that's my opinion...thoughts?... submitted by /u/WhoIsEnvy to r/Borderlands4 [link] [comments]",

If the players sit facing each other around the table, they'll have difficulty reading it (since it's upside down). This could also confuse them. I thought about making cards with the staff in both directions, but that would make the card too bulky (since it would be upside down, the card would have to be very large). I considered having the players sit side-by-side on the same side of the table, but that limits the number of players (otherwise their arms would be too short to reach the central draw pile). Do you have any other ideas? Thank you for your help. submitted by /u/Visual-Wave-9245 [link] [comments]",

The shooter has all the time they need, and they know it. “open” means there is zero defensive pressure, although the defense is nearby. There might not be a hand in the shooters face, but there’s the threat of one on the way. “contested” means a defender is having SOME impact on the shot. Maybe their body just being a little too close for comfort would give you 5%; very makable. A hand darting towards your face, maybe 15%, and makable. Jumping with you during the layup and forcing you to use the rim to protect the shot? Maybe 25%, and you can still make it, tho a few might bounce off the rim or backboard awkwardly. Closing on you with hands up and getting uncomfortably close? Maybe 30%, and you’ll miss some shots. Shane Battier sticking your hand in Kobe‘s face? Maybe 85, and unless you are the 2k version of Kobe, it likely isn’t going in. I don’t know why this is so hard for the makers of this game.
