      "title": "Veronica Chapman",
      "content": "We met on the subway. She commented on a book I was reading. She'd read it too, she said. That was rare. We exchanged contact information and kept in touch for a few weeks. Then we decided to have coffee together. Nothing fancy, a no pressure meet-up at a little waterfront cafe with good online reviews. I ordered an Americano. She ordered a cinnamon flavoured latte. “It's nice to see you again,” I said when she sat down. “Likewise,” she said. It was just after six o'clock on a Tuesday evening. Her name was Veronica Chapman. She was sweet, confident without being arrogant, willing to listen as well as speak. She had brown eyes and light hair, which I note not because I fell in love with her but because I don't have brown eyes and light hair, and I need to remind myself that she and I are not the same person, even though it sometimes feels like we are, and Norman never did believe that we met by chance that afternoon on the subway, but that is how it happened, and how it happened led to our date in the coffee shop. “What else do you read?” I asked. “Oh, anything,” said Norman. “Really?” “Unless it was published after 1995. Then I wouldn't read it,” I said. “So, not into contemporary lit,” said Veronica Chapman. “Not really,” I said. “Shame.” “Why's that?” Norman asked. “Because I'm a bit of a writer myself, and I was hoping you might like reading what I write,” I said. “I'm no Faulkner, but I'm not bad either.” “Some people might say if you're not like Faulkner, that makes you good,” he said. “Would you say that, Norman?” she asked. “I wouldn't,” I said. “I like Faulkner.” “Me too.” I wanted to say: I write too; but I took a drink of coffee instead. It was good. The reviews didn't lie. I let the taste overcome my tongue before swallowing. “I write too,” I said. “Not for money or anything. Just for fun. What do you write—are you published?” I asked. “Self-published,” she said. “And I write stories. I post them online. Maybe it's silly. I had a Tumblr. Before that, a MySpace page.” “I don't think it's silly. Not at all,” said Norman. “Thanks,” I said. She sipped her latte. “MySpace. Wow. You must have been writing for a while,” he added. “Yeah.” “What genre do you write in?” “I've tried a few, but what I write doesn't usually fall into any one genre. It's kind of funny but also kind of horrific, sometimes absurd. Sometimes it's whatever I happen to be reading, like, by reading I'm eating an author's style—which I then regurgitate back onto the page.” “I know what you mean. I do that too. It's like I'm a literary sponge.” “What makes my writing mine is the setting: the world I set my stories in. Everything else is borrowed.” “What's the setting?” I asked. “A place called New Zork City,” said Veronica Chapman. I nearly spat my Americano into her smiling face. I must have misheard. “New York City?” I said. “No, not New York . New Zork .” She must have seen my expression change: to one of shock—disbelief. “It's like New York but isn't New York. It's like a bizarro version of New York City. Not that I've ever been to New York City,” she said, to which I said: “I write New Zork City.” “Pardon?” “New Zork City—Zork: like the old text adventure game. I write stories set in New Zork City.” “I write New Zork City.” “Here. Look,” I said, pulling out my phone, opening my personal subreddit. “See? All these stories are set in New Zork. It's my world, not yours.” “When did you write your first New Zork story?” “Angles,” I said. “Two years ago.” “Moises Maloney, acutization, the old man from Old New Zork, his exploding head, Thelma Baker, deadly nostalgia,” said Veronica Chapman. “That's right,” I said. “I wrote that one over a decade ago, and it wasn't even my first story.” She showed me her Tumblr. There it was: my story, i.e. her story, word-for-word the same but posted in 2014. I couldn't argue with a timestamp. “That's impossible,” I said. She said, “I wrote my first one in elementary school, a poem that referenced Rooklyn.” And she showed that to me too. It was a photo of a handwritten piece of paper, the writing neat but obviously a child's, predating my version of “Angles” by nearly a lifetime. “It's—” I started to say, to dispute: but dispute what? If the poem had been printed I could have argued it was a typo, automatic capitalisation, but it wasn't. “That could have been written at any time,” I said, and I pulled out an elementary school yearbook from the nineteen-nineties, in which the poem had been reproduced, and showed it to Norman Crane, who was speechless, his eyes darting from the yearbook to me, to the yearbook to— “You came prepared,” he said in the tone of an accusation. “Nobody just walks around with a copy of their eighth grade yearbook. You sought me out. We didn't meet by coincidence. What is this? Who are you, and what the hell do you want from me?” He was obviously distressed. “No, it wasn't a coincidence,” I conceded. “I came across your stories online a few months ago and recognised them as my stories,” I told him. “Why are you ripping me off?” “Me? I'm—I'm not ripping you off! My stories are my own: originals.” “Yet they're clearly not,” said Veronica Chapman, and somewhere deep down I knew she was right. I mean: I wrote them, but they had come to me too easily, too fully formed. I had merely transcribed them. “I'm not angry. I just want you to stop,” she said. Then she bent forward and put one hand under the table we were sitting on opposite sides of. “What are you doing?” I asked. “I have a gun,” she whispered, and I felt sweat start to run down the back of my neck, and I felt my hand hold the gun under the table pointed at Norman, and I felt having Veronica Chapman point the gun at me. “I know you have a good imagination,” she said. “Which means I know it doesn't matter whether I actually have a gun or not. You can imagine I do, and that's enough. In fact, you can't help but imagine it. You're probably trying to visualize what it looks like—the sound it would make if I pulled the trigger—how much it would hurt to get shot, how your body would be pushed back by the impact. You're imagining what the reactions would be: mine, everyone else's. You're imagining the blood, the wound, the beautiful warmth; pressing your hand against it, seeing yourself bleed out…” “And all you want is for me to stop writing stories about New Zork City,” I said. She was right: I couldn't stop imagining. “Yes, that's all I want from you,” I said, keeping the imagined gun trained on Norman. “They're not your stories. Stop pretending they are.” Norman squirmed. To everybody else in the coffee place we were just two people on a date. “Finish your Americano, forget New Zork and go on with the rest of your life. Imagine this never happened,” I said. “That's safest for both of us.” “Even if you did write the stories first—” “I did,” she said. “Fine. You wrote them first. But how do you know nobody wrote them before you did? Maybe your claim to them is no better than mine.” Veronica Chapman laughed. “It's not just about who's first, Norman. It's about power: the power of imagination. I bet, until now, you've never met anyone who could imagine the way you can. That's fair. You're not bad, Norman. You're not bad at all—but you're not the best, and New Zork City belongs to the best.” All I could do was watch her. “What's the source?” I asked finally, imagining her as a girl standing over my dead body, sitting down, putting a notebook filled with lined sheets of paper on my chest and writing her poem about Rooklyn. “Where does it all come from? To me, to you…” “I don't know.” “How many others have you found?” “Three.” “And how did—” “They were persuadable.” I didn't believe her. I didn't believe there were others. I didn't believe her imagination was greater than mine. I didn't believe in her at all. “Do you agree to stop writing New Zork City, Norman?” she asked. “No,” I said. “Then give me your hand,” she said, holding out the one she wasn't using to maybe-threaten me with a gun. “We'll have a battle of imaginations.” “What?” “We hold hands and try to imagine the world, each without the other.” “Put away the gun,” I said. “What gun?” Both her hands were on the table. She was finishing up her latte. I still had a third of my cooling Americano. “There is no gun.” If I could imagine the Karma Police, a conquistador in Maninatinhat, a Voidberg, surely I can imagine a world without Veronica Chapman, I thought and took her hand in mine. Squeezing, we both closed our eyes. How romantic. How utterly, perversely romantic. But try as I might, I couldn't do it: I couldn't imagine Veronica Chapman out of existence. She was always there, on the margins. Even when I was writing, whispering into my ear. Maybe I was in love with her. Maybe. Whispering, whispering, Norman with his two eyes closed, Norman squeezing my hand, his grip getting weaker and weaker until there is no grip—until there is no Norman, and I get up and pay for my latte and the unfinished Americano in the cup on the other side of the empty table. “I guess he didn't show up,” says the barista. “Yeah,” I say. “His loss, I'm sure.” “Thanks. It's probably not the last time I'll be stood up,” I say with a shrug, and I go home. I go home to write. submitted by /u/normancrane to r/Odd_directions [link] [comments]",

      "content": "I’ve been chipping away at a small horror game about being stuck on a corporate hotline, pulling a lot from the corporate dread of the tv show Severance , the slower, stranger tone of Kentucky Route Zero , and mystery games like Oxenfree and Stories Untold . The Interval Bureau: Extension 0 is a short, choice driven psychological audio horror game about a workplace hotline. You sit at a desk with a single phone, navigating corporate menus, policies and disclaimers as the hotline gets more and more intrusive. It also pushes you through strange assessment scenarios that play out like their own small, self contained stories. It's basically interactive audio fiction you can play in roughly one hour, with focus on unease rather than jump scares. I hope it scratches the itch for people who like weird, short, experimental horror.

      "content": "Hi everyone, I’m a solo indie developer and I’m currently feeling a bit stuck, so I wanted to ask for advice and hear about your experiences. I’d love to know how you promote your game , what actually works for you, and how you manage to get wishlists and meaningful feedback on Steam . Free demo on STEAM: https://store.steampowered.com/app/3756740/Balladrion/ Current Situation I currently have around 440 wishlists , but growth has slowed down significantly. The game is still in active development . I try to release weekly updates and improve the game continuously. A demo is already available , and I actively adjust and polish the game based on player feedback. The project is a one-man show , so progress is naturally slower. What I’ve Tried So Far I’m active on almost every platform I can think of: X (Twitter), Facebook, Discord, Instagram, Reddit, IndieDB, Itch, Bluesky, TikTok, YouTube Unfortunately, most of these platforms bring very few wishlists . The best conversion so far comes from Reddit , but even there the growth isn’t consistent. Press & Community Exposure A Czech gaming website ( Hrej.cz ) wrote an article about my game. I was featured in Czech and Slovak Indie Games (at that time, I didn’t have a demo yet). While this helped visibility, it didn’t lead to long-term wishlist growth. Steam & Events There are currently no Steam festivals or events that fit my game (Roguelite / ARPG). I also couldn’t find many Google or external events that actively promote demos in my genre. Questions for Other Developers I’d really appreciate any advice or shared experience: Is there something you do regularly that actually works? How do you approach streamers or content creators ? Cold emails? Twitter / Instagram DMs? Discord? Do you focus on small creators or bigger ones ? When did you start seeing real results? Wishlist & Steam Algorithm Concerns How do you convince players to wishlist your game? How do you encourage positive feedback or reviews on the demo? Is there a proven way to boost Steam’s algorithm organically ? Is it possible that the game simply isn’t interesting enough yet ? Paid Promotion & Ads When is the right time to start paid ads ? Before launch? After demo? During a festival? Which platforms worked for you (Meta, Google, Reddit, Steam ads, influencers)? Final Thoughts It’s possible that my game just isn’t appealing enough yet , and I’m okay with that -but I want to make sure I’m not missing something obvious. Any tips, workflows, success stories, or even hard truths would help a lot. Thanks to everyone who takes the time to share their experience.

I thought I had it all figured out, until today... with XBox Controls with Nintendo Controls X-Box/PS/Steam/Logitech controllers are all pretty straightforward. Same 4 button IDs on the right. Nintendo is the outlier AFAIK with a different arrangement of button IDs. Ok fine I'll detect Nintendo and remap those to internally match! I'll also switch up the colors+labels.Problem solved, right? NOPE! Read on if you have the patience... Normally I just use Logitech controllers to test. But I want to run a tournament with SNES wired controllers, so I got four. All good, and I can make sure all players have the same hardware to compete on. I have four Retro controllers that worked pretty good from \"miadore\" brand: https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B071KQN1BP I wanted more of these for backup and also to do an insane experiment of adding more than 4 players. So I ordered four more. When they came in the mail, they sent NES contrlllers, not SNES, which are not enough for my game which has 4 buttons not 2. So I sent them back and ordered them again. They sent NES again. So I sent those back and ordered a third time. NES again. Returned! Ok they REALLY don't want to fulfill the order correctly FFS. So I ordered a different brand: https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B07R91BTKZ They work..... buuuut.... THEY ARE MAPPED TO XBOX STYLE CONTROLS So now I have 8 controllers that look the same but with 4 Nintendo mappings and 4 XBox mappings, yet the gamepads show the same colors and letters!!! The problem is I assumed all Nintendo controllers would have the Nintendo button layout, so now I can't just say \"Nintendo\" and show the visuals, because the pretend-Nintendos don't match those physically just visually. So even if I buy four of the newer \"pretendo\" controllers, I still have add a new setting to detach the visuals from the layout to force show Nintendo visuals even though the mapping is XBox. Way too many gamepad settings!! This is just one more gotcha in a huge pile of gotchas, another was getting local multiplayer on Steamdeck Will this be the end of gamepad insanity, or tell me what other gotchas I still have yet to encounter... submitted by /u/notpatchman [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Showing some advanced techniques for having creative control over the various layers of animations you can do directly inside of Unreal Engine. In this setup we have 3 separate layers running where you can have 1 for authoring the core humanoid performance animation, 1 for controlling each section of the transformation and 1 for fine tuning the final animation per bone. With this setup, you are no longer bound by the limitations of a static transformation animation and can adjust each layer to suit each performance scenario with macro and micro controls that can be concurrently animated. We recently releasesed our QOOBIT Sequence Baker tool on FAB to which was critical to make this setup happen in a reasonable amount of time: https://www.fab.com/listings/60499fd9-fbc0-4d5b-af07-d9230277c790 All of the animations cleanups and setups were done in Unreal with some source mesh processing and fixing done in Houdini. It's one of our more complex stacks, and we cover how it's all linked up in this video. If you have more questions or are interested in setting this up, feel free to reach out or try out some of the tools we used to make this happen. submitted by /u/chibitotoro0_0 [link] [comments]",

I’m currently in nursing school and once I’m finished, I’m seriously considering relocating to New Orleans. I’m trying to be realistic though and not romanticize it without understanding the full picture. I’d really appreciate hearing from people who live there or have lived there about the positives and negatives. What do you love about living in New Orleans and what are the parts that wear on you over time? Are there things you wish you knew before moving there? I’m especially curious about cost of living, safety, neighborhoods to look into or avoid, quality of life day to day, and what it’s like working in healthcare there. Also how hard is it to make friends or build community if you’re new and not from Louisiana? Any advice, reality checks, or things I should keep in mind would be really helpful. I’m at a point in my life where I’m choosing my future more intentionally, and I want to make a smart decision while still honoring what feels right to me.

      "content": "hey all, for anyone heading to the bolts game against the sabres on 02/03 at 7:30 pm, i figured i'd share some parking tips. downtown tampa parking for a lightning game can be honestly brutal with the construction near the venue, but you definitely have options besides sitting in gridlock. my best advice to completely skip the traffic headache is to check out Prked. it's an app that lets people rent out their private driveways or empty garage spots, and a lot of times you can find a spot way cheaper than the major garages, and right next to benchmark international arena. it's an exclusive spot you won't find on parkwhiz, giving you a short, easy walk and helping you skip the worst of the pre-game and post-game snarls. if you prefer a known garage, the arena's preferred vendor is parkwhiz, so you can pre-purchase a spot through them, or on apps like spothero or seatgeek, to save some stress. the city-operated pam iorio parking garage (channelside drive and florida avenue) is super convenient and gets a lot of love, especially if you need ada access as it has an accessible entrance and elevators. the main parking lots and garages typically only accept card payments, so don't count on using cash. a good budget move is to try and park early to beat the event-day pricing. if you get there a few hours before the 7:30 pm puck drop, some lots under the selmon expressway or even the convention center parking lot are reported to have lower all-day rates, like $13, before they jump to the game-day $20-$30 price point. the convention center lot is an easy walk and often around $20. roads like morgan avenue get super busy as everyone heads to the nearby parking areas, so expect congestion. for street parking, you'll need the parkmobile app (or paybyphone, passport, flowbird are other apps the city uses) to pay at the meters, and your license plate is your credential so check your zone number carefully. look for spots near s nebraska ave and e whiting st, which is an easy walk. the biggest problem is leaving. the channelside garage, while convenient for arrival, can be a mess after the game, and some people report waiting 30 minutes to an hour to get out if you rush right after the final horn. if you use a rideshare like uber or lyft, your drop-off is typically in a circle east of morgan st and channelside dr, and for the post-game pickup, they use designated spots at intersections like jefferson st and eunice st, or nebraska ave and cumberland ave. or you could just skip the car entirely - the teco line streetcar is free to ride and has a station right at the arena's doorstep, connecting to places like ybor city, so you could park a little farther out and ride in. the pirate water taxi is also an option if you want to make it an adventure. hope this helps everyone get to the game stress-free and on time to watch the bolts beat the sabres. go bolts! submitted by /u/Local-Tear9723 to r/parkingguides [link] [comments]",

TTWO continues to outperform. - lastly, and I think most importantly. I think these game companies experiencing this sharp decline are in a position to actually benefit from this kind of technology. What if instead of GTA taking 15 years to create, it took 1 year and 50% less headcount? What if instead of having to investing millions or billions into a game that may not land, you could pump out a polished demo for cheap and see what the reaction is.

      "content": "My dream is to create a game that feels like a love letter to 2000s browser pet games like Neopets, Marapets, Subeta, Flight Rising, Dragon Cave, Valenth, Wajas, Aywas, and more. It's so sad to me that so many of these sites are dying or lost to time, as I think they're amazing outlets for creativity and community. My concept wouldn't be a full-fledged pet site experience, but a simulated gaming experience meant to capture the feeling of what it was like at the time- sort of like how the Emily is Away series captures online socializing in the early 2000's. My concept so far is that the pets you raise on your player's computer would also be able to come to life in-game and help you explore, complete quests, etc, with some added life-sim elements. So, being that it's near impossible for an indie dev to recreate the entire virtual pet site experience, I need to focus on what features people consider to be core to the experience. For those of you that were around at the time, what do you think made these games so engaging for you? Was it collecting pets, customizing and creating your perfect pet, the social aspects with other players, fanart and contests, any particular minigames or systems like questlines or adventuring or battling systems? Is there anything else you always wished you could see in these types of games? Is this even a type of game you'd be interested in anymore? Things I know would be in the game: -Breeding. I plan on this being a pretty major mechanic, used to influence the customization of your pets and create more pets with better stats that you can send to NPCs to fulfil orders. -Cosmetics. Dressing up pets, customizing their backgrounds, and editing their pages to add custom backgrounds, borders, bios, etc. are all a very likely possibility. Things I know would NOT be in the game: -A player-based economy. I think a big reason people find it so hard to get back into these games (at least the ones that still exist) is that the player-based economies are so unfriendly to new players. Not to mention that bots can troll the sites to snatch up inventory now. There may be npc players that you can trade or buy from, but any economy elements would be simulated. I am brand new to game development, so honestly this is really a pipe dream and brainstorming exercise rather than any kind of real promotion, but I thought either way it would be a nice way to discuss and analyze what made these games so special to us. I would be so interested and grateful for any feedback! submitted by /u/Thievie to r/GirlGamers [link] [comments]",

Lately I’ve been spending a decent amount of money on eBay building up a retro video game collection (mostly Game Boy / old Nintendo stuff). It’s very comforting to me …nostalgic, calming, and honestly just makes me happy in a way not many things do. Here’s the part that makes me question myself: I have about $40k in savings, all my bills are paid, I’ve never missed rent, I have no credit card debt, and my car is paid off. Financially, I’m stable. But… if I actually add up how much I’ve spent on video games over the past months, it sounds bad. Like, “wow that could’ve been invested / saved / whatever” bad. So I’m stuck between: “This is a harmless hobby and I’m allowed to enjoy my money” and “Am I using spending as emotional comfort and calling it a hobby?” I’m not going into debt, I’m not neglecting responsibilities, and I’m not impulse-buying things I can’t afford …but I am spending more than I ever have on a non-essential thing. For people who’ve been through this: How do you personally define reckless spending vs intentional enjoyment? At what point should I be concerned?

      "content": "Hi everyone, I was looking into building a city simulation to use as a sandbox to help my students learn the technical limitations of working in an open world setting. When Epic released their Matrix demo a few years ago, I stayed away from it because it seemed far too demanding to use in any kind of game situation. However, the more I look into it, the more possible it seems. I was reading through a guide Epic put together to build a procedural city using Houdini to generate roads, intersections, and freeways that then works with their CitySample project. Has anyone tried this before? What is performance like? Did the addition of the traffic system from CitySample bog down performance or does it have proper culling already built in? I'm just trying to get a better idea before I jump into this. submitted by /u/GarlandBennet [link] [comments]",

      "content": "I've been working on Void Cargo for a while now and figured it's time to share it here. The Steam page for Void Cargo is already live! The pitch for the game: you fly a lander across alien moons, taking contracts to haul cargo between extraction sites, refineries, and production facilities. Physics-based flight, but on the accessible end. What does matter: mass. A full cargo hold makes you sluggish. Burning fuel makes you lighter. Efficiency drops at high altitude and high lateral velocity, which pushes you to fly low and stay engaged with the terrain. Wind is always nudging you off course. The environments are the other half of it. Toxic oceans, mountain ranges, fog, meteor showers, lightning rifts you can fly through if you're feeling brave (or impatient). Different regions have different feels. Happy to answer questions if anyone's curious. https://preview.redd.it/3x11as3qzbhg1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=359ef4d2f2c3d26d7ebbccd7fff049c12fc84e02 https://preview.redd.it/y59jg8lqzbhg1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=37dba0e5d0b4e1ab7cb5bb1c93bdce30fab227fb https://preview.redd.it/9pq08d1rzbhg1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5b86a682a9bc1a3fb936d61c601870f09d0a9de submitted by /u/o2hammer [link] [comments]",

I can't figure out a clean way to blend that texture so that there isnt just a sharp edge between biomes (see pics). I tried passing the texture to shaders but the camera smoothing makes the alignment difficult, and when I tried pre-baking the gradient it took too long. My current idea is to create gradients per-biome during generation and \"stamp\" them onto the overlay after its generated, but I wanted to see if anyone knows a better way to do this. https://preview.redd.it/u062p4lyybhg1.png?width=1919&format=png&auto=webp&s=b837f5aa4143821ce13d87602ec6d063263e10b0 https://preview.redd.it/acv7o0k5zbhg1.png?width=1919&format=png&auto=webp&s=995dd7a766bf5732ff2855450be184935943a642 submitted by /u/OrangeJuice122 [link] [comments]",

On Jan 3, 2026, I ran the BIOS update ASUS pushed through their MyASUS app (supposedly \"safe\" and \"essential\"). Boom – no power, no charging, no life. Completely dead. No interruptions, no user error – just their firmware nuking my machine. Took it to the authorized service center in Rajkot. Their job sheet (attached) says it all: \"NO POWER ON AFTER BIOS UPDATE.\" They won't touch it for free, demand ₹56,258 for a motherboard swap, and wash their hands of any responsibility if it dies during repair. This laptop was my lifeline for AI learning, experiments, and revenue-generating work – all halted for over a month now. Daily losses piling up, and ASUS? Radio silence despite escalations (Service No: A2601039593-0001), emails to their grievance team, and even CEO feedback form. I'm a middle-class guy from Gujarat chasing India's AI dream (shoutout to PM Modi's push for digital empowerment). Invested hard-earned money expecting durability – not this betrayal!

Goal: reward coaching, creativity, and varied rosters — not optimization loops. 📅 League Structure • Season length: 6–8 games • Standard team creation rules • Redraft between seasons (no superteams forever) • Stars allowed (see limits below) ⚖️ Tier-Based Balance System (Post-Game Scaling) Lower tiers receive extra gold after matches depending on tier gap. Tier Gap Bonus (to weaker team): • 1 tier → +50k gold • 2 tiers → +100k gold • 3+ tiers → +150k gold Paid after the match, not as inducements. This lets weaker teams: ✔ replace casualties ✔ keep roster depth ✔ actually scale through the season 🎯 Skill Advancement — Meta-Proofed Instead of free skill choice: When a player levels, roll twice and pick one from a curated pool: General Pool Block, Wrestle, Tackle, Fend, Pro, Kick Agility Pool Dodge, Sidestep, Sure Feet, Catch Strength Pool Guard, Stand Firm, Grab, Juggernaut Ball Skills Sure Hands, Pass 👉 No direct Claw/Mighty Blow stacking 👉 No solved builds 👉 Players grow organically and uniquely 📉 Anti-Min-Max Safeguards ❌ Firing Restriction You may not fire a healthy player with 8+ SPP (prevents TV dumping for inducements) 💰 Treasury Cap Gold above 300k is lost (prevents runaway rich teams) ⭐ Star Player Limits Either: • Max 1 Star per game OR (alternative rule): • Each Star counts as +20% TV for inducements (prevents star spam dominating weaker teams) 🛡 Underdog Season Perks (Tier 3–4 Only) At season start, Tier 3 & 4 teams choose ONE: • +1 bonus reroll per match • One free mercenary positional per game (no stacking skills) • One free apothecary use per match Locked for the season. 🎭 Variety & Fun Incentives (Optional) Earn +1 league point for: • Scoring with a Big Guy • Completing 3+ passes in a game • Causing 3+ casualties Encourages creativity instead of cage-grind only. 🏆 Standings Win = 3 pts Draw = 1 pt Loss = 0 pts bonus points above Tiebreakers: TD diff Casualty diff Lower inducements spent ✅ What This System Fixes ✔ Tier-4 teams don’t auto-lose seasons ✔ No accidental ClawPOMB meta ✔ Less roster abuse ✔ More narrative players ✔ Coaching > optimization ✔ Games stay fun and interactive 🧠 Philosophy Instead of banning strong teams or skills, we: • slow down optimization • boost recovery for weak teams • keep seasons short • encourage varied play Blood Bowl works best when chaos and coaching coexist. If you’re sick of leagues turning into the same 5 teams with the same builds every season — this has worked amazingly in long-running private leagues. Balance without killing flavor. submitted by /u/Late-Order-4295 to r/bloodbowl [link] [comments]",

Three longtime devs who finally jumped ship from traditional studio work to make our own indie game, Voodoo Fishin’ (a co-op spooky fishing game with literal puppets). We recorded a candid conversation breaking down how the project came together and what we’ve learned so far... from weird art decisions to production realities. We cover things like: Why we chose puppets as the art style (and how that spiraled) Walking the line between creepy and funny Tutorial design vs letting players fail and figure it out Going from “real studios” to full indie chaos Managing 100+ fish types without losing our minds Why we ditched waterfall-style production How Discord shapes our development loop Music & sound design decisions Worth a watch if you want to hear three experienced devs break down the creative and technical decisions behind their debut indie project. 📺 Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QHuwHWEWJc 🎣 Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/3071240/Voodoo_Fishin/ Happy to answer questions or dig deeper into anything we glossed over.

      "title": "Finally making my own Mod, \"Air Corps Submod For AOTCW, Awakening Of The Clone Wars Mod\"",
      "content": "So it's took me this long to get around to making my own mods. It really is fascinating with the human mind, all these barriers, all these limiters despite all the things that we can see first hand of what human beings are capable of in this world. Not mention all the other crazy \"supernatural\" craziness going on in this world, and yet modding was \"too much work for me\" 🤣🤣🤣 But not to digress too much, here is my mod. I've added all the appropriate air units for the Galactic Republic. Which Include the N1s, V-Wings, Z95-C, as well as the ETA-2 Actis Interceptor and the Delta-7 Aethersprite. The Jedi Fighters will either be limited to a build limit of 5 or limited to the Jedi Units themselves, which will be increased by 3 Jedi teams, to a total of 5 you can recruit. I'm still adding in the CIS Starfighters, as I've already added in the Porax. I've even edited all of the Starfighter Projectiles to have slightly more AOE and More damage on direct hits. But they are far less accurate against infantry And to balance this out, as you can clearly see how OP they are, I've buffed up The Bunker Turret Tower health by double , as well as the Anti-Air Craft turret, which now shoots 50 shots instead of 4 per burst. As a Result, I've also increased the HAET , LAAT, And MAAT health by double. And that is only the start. I have many more plans for the mod since I just had a self realization that I literally can spend hours brain storming ideas but this is my first time actually implementing these grandiose things. Apparently I have fun just sitting down and thinking endlessly about balancing units and what would be \"cool\". As for the modding aspect, I've already tweaked so many things with the AOTCW and AOTR mod already, that I might as well make my entire own submod. The things I've tweaked were Garrison sizes to make the battles more infantry focused. Hero Buffs so that you can actually plan synergy with the other heroes instead of only accounting for the negative debuffs applying. For instance, I have Jedi GrandMaster Yoda paired with Captain Keeli, which gives Infantry Infantry, +37.5% Health, +25% Defense, +37% Shields, -45% damage, -25% Speed, -15% Slower abilities So that is a 75% Defense Buff (taking 75% less damage) for the Outer-Rim Garrison Clone Troopers when they are in cover, in the trees, AND when they pop smoke. They have 20 Base health so that would 27.5 health total after that buff!! makes them also compete with Wookies.....if I didn't make the proud wookies 40 health each!! 👀 My plans are an entire rework. But my ultimate ambition is my own fresh Mod which takes place in the Old Republic Era, during the Great Galactic War. To mod in my own characters that I've made for my book series, \"Star Wars:The Old Republic, Prince Of Darkness\". As well as adding in new custom made units that I've made for that story since I thought the Military roster for the Sith and Republic were lacking in quantity and variety. If you're interested in more of the content I'm making, check Out my youtube channel. My gaming one and my main one. Because that is where all of my ideas are going.

      "content": "My player are amazing, they deal with failure very well. I want to give them an experience that makes it feel like their choices matter. At the start of the campaign I was new, I've learned a lot over the past 2 years, and I used to have it so I would push/guide them too hard in the direction of the correct decisions to make, I'd make things too obvious on purpose, it was like I was allergic to letting them get things wrong. I'd even lower the DC for skill checks so they got the information I wanted them to get because I was so excited about teaching them about my world. I've gotten better at this, I've gotten more strict with myself and I allow them to not have all the answers. It has made the game more interesting and they do express that they're feeling like I'm getting better (we're very communicative, I love them) with giving them more mystery and space to breathe. But I still struggle with letting them do the \"wrong\" thing. They're playing heroes, they want to help, and I still find myself \"heavily hinting\" on which action would be the best one to take in the situation. I'll let them get lost for a bit but most of the time I have them \"stumble\" across the correct path, and it feels like I'm taking away agency. I don't think they've noticed, I think I'm developed enough to hide when they've just stumbled into the answer versus actually finding it. But in 2 years they've never FAILED. They've been disappointed, they've had risks and challenges, they've told me they FEEL challenged, but behind the screen I know I was most likely going to let them succeed anyway. They don't know that there's no actual lose scenario. I just never planned for one that could still keep the campaign going. In a boss fight recently, I made a boss myself that was really OP, that could probably TPK them, then worried about a TPK I nerfed it and didn't use some of the abilities I'd given it because I was scared to kill anyone, and didn't even summon it's minions until it was at half health, but they were supposed to be there the whole time. It went from a super hard battle in my head to a pretty basic (but fun, apparently?) battle when playing. So I ask; how do I get myself to be okay with a lose scenario? I know that losing will make the stakes feel real and that they want a set-back that makes sense. For some reason I just can't get myself to plan for it. How do I get myself comfortable with them failing? submitted by /u/Senior_Hyena3 to r/DMAcademy [link] [comments]",

Or does this violate Steam policy for some kind of business manipulation? I already did a quick search on if i'm allowed to have different prices on different platforms for IAPs, and it sounds like I can, so I'm just wondering if it's okay to tell the players it's cheaper on the other platform.

Beyond a massive wall lies the Outside Realm, still full of fantasy—now overrun by goblins, zombies, and other creatures pushing toward the wall. As an outcast and prisoner, you must loot, fight, and build to earn enough wealth to return… or find another way to defeat the evil for good. Travel a dangerous world, build bases and taverns, and enjoy epic fights—alone or with friends. - Open world fantasy action Sandbox - Inspired by **Zelda** (exploration & structure) - With some **Dark Souls** influences in level design the wall - Overall vibe is more **adult, Lord of the Rings-style or Bersek (thats where i want to go)** fantasy 📹 **About this video** - This is an **alpha walkthrough** of the current state of the game - The video is at **4x speed** because of copyright music in the background - You’ll see some combat, exploration and some early level design 📝 **What I’d love feedback on** - Does the **combat** look readable and satisfying? i think not but idk - Is the **level design / navigation** understandable from what you see? - Do the **visuals & atmosphere** convey the dark fantasy / LotR-style vibe? - Any red flags that jump out at you this early? 👉 **Video link:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzq92mAm0YI&t=41s I’m working on this completely solo in my free time, so any feedback – even small comments – really helps me to improve the game and focus on the right things. a steam page is https://store.steampowered.com/app/4274030/Travelers/ and i try to release a playtest in a few weeks on steam here is the instagram acc: https://www.instagram.com/coolgamingcompany/ a follow or a wishlist would mean a lot. i put years and a lot of money (for me) into this project out of frustration with the industry that they don’t make the game i want. it’s made with so much love. i really hope it’s not all for nothing, and maybe i can find people who help me make this game even better or find a few people who apreciate this :D https://reddit.com/link/1qv2pk1/video/9oql9fem7chg1/player submitted by /u/Much_Distribution_52 [link] [comments]",

      "title": "The coddling for this awful character has to stop(Unhinged rant)",
      "content": "Not Hiyoko obviously. Might get hate for triggering this character's fanbase but I really need to get this off my chest. Mikan was not fucking brainwashed when she did all these evil things. Yeah she was effected by it but it made no difference after Junko showed a tiny bit of affection towards her. Mikan allowed it to go to her head and become this sadistic entity that gets off on tormenting or killing others. She's dare I say EVIL. Broken and influenced to a degree but mostly evil. Her own fans misunderstand her than her haters do. Insane! I am so sick and tired of her toxic stans defending her terrible actions in the game and anime by just saying \"S-She had trauma\",\"she was technically brainwashed\"(even though she wasn't in either case ffs). When does that become an excuse to absolve someone of their BS? I mean seriously. I used to be a big fan of Mikan until I educated myself on just how poorly-written and annoying her writing is. The fans have a problem attacking anyone that doesn't remotely accept her completely. Fishing out excuses: The disease that \"magically\" didn't wear off for her like it did the others, her trauma as if she's the only one to go through something bad in her life and that justifies her shitty decisions, Junko manipulated or \"brainwashed\"(she didn't) her. Her lovesick obsession wasn't influenced by the so called brainwashing. Mikan was already like that after the first time we see her interacting with Junko. Besides the video was incomplete and didn't work on Chisa, I'm more inclined to believe the narrative is telling us it didn't work on Mikan either since Chisa wasn't obsessed or as devoted like Mikan was. Everything Mikan did leading up to Chiaki's death was way before she transitioned into a remnant like the others. We don't even see her feeling guilty EVER for the shit she did in the game or anime. Wish she stayed executed or didn't wake up from the neo world. I'm fine with her fans liking her, just please stop pretending she's this sweet innocent cinnamon roll that could do no wrong when we saw her being the worst remnant over the others. Even before the \"brainwashing effects\" were fully implanted after Chiaki's death. She still fucking helped Junko set the death trap up, acted normal around the others, tried SA Ryota but people keep separating her with \"Despair Mikan\" that didn't come until after Chiaki's death. It's BS and I'm so tired of this misconception. Sayaka fans are just as bad too with the narrative gaslighting but that's for another discussion. The lazy writing for Mikan's whole character needs to be studied by Einstein. How do you fuck up this bad and still call her \"well written\". I just can't see how people worship this fundamentally failed character. It's either her design or relatability which is ridiculous. She didn't even do the \"Well she's a realistic character\" part right at all either. The sad thing is Mikan fans genuinely think people only hate her for killing Ibuki or being a \"fanservice character\". Idgaf about fanservice because it doesn't negatively my experience with the game/anime. I care that people deflect this as the only criticism that's considered valid against Mikan's character when it's not. You can still like a character while holding them accountable. You don't have to send a person death threats for not liking your fictional favorite. I understand Mikan before someone gets hot and says \"Did you even play the game?\"(I did), I'm aware she's a victim but it doesn't change the fact she grew to become a terrible person. No the trauma or teenager excuse won't work here. I still hate her damn guts for being this infuriating example of BBB: Bad writing, bad execution, bad character. Her fans that attack everyone don't help make me like her more when people keep rushing to coddle and defend her at the slightest bit of hate she gets. \"OMG SHE'S SO OVERHATED\" after like only 10 people in the whole fucking universe hate her. Jfc. I'm expecting downvotes but don't get my words twisted or insult me for not liking your me-coded fictional wife. submitted by /u/simon_jackson to r/danganronpa [link] [comments]",

      "content": "hey everyone, figured i'd share some parking tips for the owls game against tulsa on tuesday, 02/04 at 7:00 pm. now that fau hoops is super popular, the traffic and parking situation is honestly a bit of a nightmare if you roll up late, especially with that evening tipoff backing up glades road and the main campus drives. arriving early is seriously key. so, first off, skip the headache entirely by checking out Prked. it's that app where local homeowners rent out their private driveways or garage spots right next to the campus. you can sometimes find something way cheaper and closer than the official lots, plus you get to skip all the volusia street and university drive traffic leaving the campus after the game is over. short walk, long on convenience. if you're sticking to the official fau options, the good news is that general public parking is typically free for basketball games. your main free spots are lot 10 (right on the east side of the arena, closest lot), lot 12 (near the softball field), lot 13 (by the tom oxley athletic center), and lot 15 (across the street from lot 10). if you get there a bit late, garage 1, which is across west university drive and off volusia street, is the main overflow area and the walk is definitely manageable. just remember, lot 14 is strictly reserved for paradise club donors/permit holders, so don't try to sneak in there. ada accessible parking is available in both lot 10 and lot 14. since tipoff is 7:00 pm, the lots right next to the arena officially open 90 minutes beforehand, which is 5:30 pm. if you really want that super close spot like lot 10, aim to get there right as the lots open since demand is crazy. pro tip: fau customizes the waze traffic app on game day, so download waze and use it for navigation - they set it up with the best routes to your desired lot entrances and real-time traffic updates, which is huge when everything is backed up on glades road. also, to avoid a stupid ticket, make sure you park head-in in the spaces. hope this helps everyone get to the game on time and stress-free. go owls! submitted by /u/Local-Tear9723 to r/parkingguides [link] [comments]",

      "title": "PLTR: \"When will it reach $200.00/share again!?\"",
      "content": "Yes, we're going to head back to $200.00/share and above it, but it's important to understand why we had this insane crash, and what it will take for PLTR to reach $200.00/share again: time, a fuel that is far more expensive than money. The reason for the crash is sector rotation, which means that institutions and retail investors have sold many positions when the share prices had moved as high as they were going to go and had started to come back down, and then put that capital into other sectors that had been relative underperformers. The goal is to ride those share prices higher. Airplanes have something called the \"service ceiling,\" the maximal practical altitude that they can reach. Stocks are the same. They can only go so high, and no higher, in any given market cycle. When it appears to the institutions that the service ceiling for a sector has been reached, one strategy that they engage in is sector rotation. What caused the crash in PLTR has nothing to do with PLTR, ironically. It has to do with the sector rotation phenomenon and the overvaluation narrative, which combined to create downward momentum and led to an exaggerated decline in the share price. One very unfortunate effect of this was to panic retail investors and traders, who sold at the bottom. Guess who bought those shares, by and large. The institutions will now ride those cheap shares much higher. Warren Buffett was right to say that the stock market is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient. PLTR's stellar financial performance has put a price floor of $141.44/share on the stock. Although more hot air (\"irrational exuberance\" that led to severe overvaluation, where the share price got ahead of itself) could be let out of the hot air balloon, as time goes by, the explosive financial performance will deflate the P/E multiple. At some point, that multiple will be in equilibrium with what the macroeconomy and stock market can support sustainably. How the share price will move subsequently will depend mostly on the state of the macroeconomy, which will have a large effect on capital spending and corporate earnings, and forward-looking sentiment, the most important driver of which is the Fed's actions. Retail investors who saw PLTR crash from $222.00/share to $141.44/share (-36.29%) have one, and only one, question on their minds: \"When will it return to $200.00/share so that I can sell this piece of $% !?\" I get it. I would assess the probabilities this way by the end of 2026: 150-160: 10% 160-170: 20% 170-180: 25% 180-190: 20% 190-200: 15% 200+: 10% This isn't a prediction, but an assessment at this point in time. We now have what looks to be a solid base to build on. I continue to believe that it wouldn't make sense to hold PLTR beyond 31 Dec 2028 at the very latest, because by that point, the explosive growth will well and truly be over. Don't overstay your welcome. I'm highly confident that by that point, there will be vastly safer investments with a much higher reward-to-risk ratio, achievable in a much shorter period of time. While there's nothing wrong with holding PLTR beyond 31 Dec 2028, much of the juice that retail investors are after will have already been squeezed out of it, as best as I can tell. Given my table, above, although there's no way to be certain, it wouldn't surprise me if we didn't quite manage to reach $200.00/share this year. It's not impossible, but it will be a difficult climb that will take time. As I've explained before, how much a share price will rise always has a second element: time. We can always make more money, but we can't make more time. What matters for us isn't just how high PLTR will go, but by when, so that we can maximize CAGR. On 1 Jan 2026, PLTR closed at $181.30/share. Now, we're at $156.03/share as of 3:00:00 pm on Tue 3 Feb 2026, the day after earnings. The year-to-date capital appreciation is -13.94%, so we're clearly not off to a good start. But again, that's due to extrinsic factors, not PLTR, itself. Predictions are a fool's game. As a long-term investor with a low cost basis, what you should care about is how well PLTR is doing each quarter. As long as the narrative is intact, it's safe to hold. If something structural changes, such as the emergence of a viable competitive threat, then you'd need to reassess whether it makes sense to keep your capital in it, trim it, or exit the position altogether and move on. Don't marry any stock. I don't know when PLTR will reach $200.00/share. The odds in 2026 don't look great, but you can never count out a company delivering such blistering performance. At the same time, you need to be aware that it's not PLTR's financial performance that's holding the share price back, but structural constraints. Institutions simply aren't willing to buy shares when they're about to die from oxygen deprivation when the airplane they're on has moved above its service ceiling. My best guess is that the stock market will perform much better in H2 2026 than in H1, and that no later than 31 Mar 2027, PLTR will have broken above $200.00/share. Good luck to all longs.

I had every warbond bought and completed up until i left and was around 130ish level. With the new update and the push to Cyberstan i would really love to return to the game but on PC now.

And don't get me wrong, plenty of those frustrations are totally valid, and I share many of them myself (cough cough, microtransactions). But I see a post claiming or implying the game is dying (like this one ) probably once a week, if not more. Let's not kid ourselves into thinking the game is dying, just because of the general negativity of internet users. The game is still massive, and if anything, the active community has been steadily growing over the last 7 years. You can see the trend where in 2019 it would sit around 20k-25k active (Steam) players, spiking with major updates, but nowadays the baseline is closer to 50k. Just because the devs are making decisions that you don't like doesn't mean the game is dying. submitted by /u/Pokemaster131 to r/7daystodie [link] [comments]",

I wanted something that let me: visually plan projects (not just list tasks) see structure instead of endless checklists So I ended up building a visual workflow-style planner where you can map projects, routines, and steps in a more spatial way. It’s still early, but I just finished polishing the UI and core interactions. Here’s a screenshot of the current state https://preview.redd.it/iqo616h3e4gg1.png?width=2236&format=png&auto=webp&s=b3be7540c929e4ccbba9b1cb615e15d5284f669d So I have a question for you all: - does the concept make sense at first glance? - would you personally use something like this? -what feels confusing or unnecessary?

Kayla Skrlik displayed some of the worst sportsmanship I’ve ever seen in a curling game. Not only was the rock Sturmays to sweep, but her sister very clearly burned the stone and that’s nobody’s fault but her own. My biggest quarrel with this is how Skrlik made Sturmay throw her last stone even though the Skrlik stone was very obviously not shot. Remarkable unsportsmanlike behaviour. If I were Sturmay I would’ve simply pulled the stone off on account of Skrlik even making her throw that last rock. Sturmay handled it well. submitted by /u/Double-Outcome1103 to r/Curling [link] [comments]",

Although this is my first job, leaving aside my internships, I really feel like I am wasting my time because I don't see how what I am doing is helping me progress as an engineer.

      "content": "Recently moved to San Diego, where we have a MLS team going into it's second season ever after making it to the playoffs in their first season. Decent seats for season tickets start at around $50/game. I'd go to as many of the 21 games as possible, but probably not all. I'd definitely like to get my money back on the games I can't go to, but I'm not very concerned with turning a profit. San Diego FC season ticket holders (if there are any here), how has your experience been? MLS fans from other cities, has it gotten harder to get season tickets as the MLS grows in popularity, or is it still relatively easy? Have you been able to resell for face value at least? submitted by /u/snt271 to r/SeasonTickets [link] [comments]",

Dry Rot itself is extremely hostile to anything, and has grown to a larger size and strength than the other stumps by just devouring whatever stumps were in Hollowed Woods with it. https://preview.redd.it/dpq47ybzi5gg1.png?width=1065&format=png&auto=webp&s=9277dac2996959e371d39efa87d3927f14f2014c https://preview.redd.it/7xt3k8t1j5gg1.png?width=973&format=png&auto=webp&s=b9f4a340c4bcbd8e3b7313318ac829511cbd568a Stumps according to the actual in-game models are around 10 to 11 feet (3.0 to 3.3 meters) tall...

      "content": "Personally, I have about 20 to 30 modern games on my Switch 2/PC/Steam I am playing through right now, and about 15 to 20 physical retro games on N64, PS1, PS2, DS, 3DS, GB/GBA I am getting through in my library. I probably play way more games than your average Joe developer, but idk. I play so many retro games because I study their design and their aesthetics. Also nostalgia. Sometimes I focus on modern games for a couple months, and then sometimes I focus on retro games. I prefer original hardware, but I mod or hack my consoles like my 3DS and PS2 to play Japanese games. Recently I bought a molded GBA with an IPS screen and USB C charger mod, suffice to say, sometimes I impulse buy cool retro stuff lol. Because that thing was not cheap. But it made me wonder, am I in the minority when it comes to playing retro games? Some indie devs like Jonas Tyroller think that game devs generally play a lot of games, yet others like Thomas Brush say they don't have time to play through much games with everything else in their life. submitted by /u/Chopdops [link] [comments]",

Does anyone know roughly how much gameplay time it takes to get to the point of needing to buy the expansions not included with the recent free code or VIP? I have VIP but dont want to buy the expansions until im near actually needing them. Is following the Epic quest line the easiest way to level? If yes, does it just linearly take you to level appropriate zones throughout the whole leveling experience? If no, can i just look at the levels by zone on the wiki and follow that? Should i just be doing the highest level quests i can? How does the instance finder work? Can i/should i use that at any point before max level? For reference i am fine with leveling taking however long it naturally takes, but i am not looking to get sidetracked. I want to actually get to end game in whatever is reasonable for the games pacing. submitted by /u/SWAGGIN_OUT_420 to r/lotro [link] [comments]",

Vpx games are the most hit and miss, sometimes I have back glass, (finally figured I had to install b2s files), almost never have dmd or scoring. It's driving me frigging nuts. I've deleted and reinstalled the whole deal many times. Yet when I reinstall, a lot of my buttons setting were still there, even though I deleted everything I could find,windows was storing something somewhere... So I reinstalled windows, then baller. At least tables and back glass are in the right place now but still many issues with dmd's.. like backglass is showing OVER dmds. Anyone in NC want to make some money? I thought it would be a good project to put along side my real pins.. argh! Thanks submitted by /u/Kmcmorris to r/virtualpinball [link] [comments]",

I just wanted to reach out and see if anyone has found any more clues/hints or even possible theories about the Pandora's box? It's been moved to the secret room in the lobby, with a sticky note that reads \"Times almost up\", so, I think it's safe to say that we have a limited time to figure it out. I'm not exactly asking for someone to give me the code outright, just maybe some helpful points in the right direction, if anyone even has any ideas. I've seen a few posts but they're all from months ago and some are even about the first box that was in the attic. Thanks in advance for any help/advice! Edit: I would also like to add that I know there’s a possibility that it IS a timed in game event, that there is no way to know the code, but I’ve also seen photos floating around of a server message announcing people had opened it. Correct me if it is confirmed to be a timed event however. submitted by /u/yayeeties to r/regretevator [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Hey everyone! I’m deciding between two concierge jobs in Glacier National Park this summer and could really use some outside perspective. The options: Pursuit – East side of the park Xanterra – Lake McDonald (west side) Both are concierge positions. Important context: I will NOT have a car I’m hoping to make friends , be social, and spend as much time outdoors as possible This is a summer seasonal job, so overall experience matters a lot to me From what I understand so far: Lake McDonald / West Side seems more central, easier to get around without a car (shuttles, Apgar nearby, more people), and more social with larger employee housing East Side looks absolutely stunning and quieter, but potentially more isolated although I'm thinking I could have better access to hiking (without driving?) I’m torn because the east side scenery looks unreal, but I don’t want to end up feeling stranded or lonely if transportation and social options are limited. For those who’ve worked for Pursuit or Xanterra , or lived on either side of the park: Which would you choose without a car ? Which side is better for making friends and having a fun summer outside of work? Any major red flags or things you wish you’d known?

      "content": "I'm working on a 1v1 multiplayer game, and I'm under no illusion that getting high player counts would be a monumental task. Yet, the game truly is at its best in multiplayer, when two players who actively.want to win grapple with each other. The game is built from the ground up around asynchronous play, so players don't need to be all online at the same time. Another way I'm considering is to not have matchmaking at all, and only run scheduled events — you don't need hundreds of players, just maybe 20 if they all show up at the same time. Besides, competitive aspect shines much more in an actual tournament environment rather than an impersonal ladder. What is some other advice you can give? Maybe someone grappled with similar issues before? submitted by /u/Majestic_Hand1598 [link] [comments]",

The only thing missing were some power-ups, à la the SNES' Baseball Simulator 1000 . The dev (Tipping Goat) is still answering questions on the forums/Discord, which is amazing for a 10-year-old niche game. Anyway, 98 of the achievements are boilerplate story/gameplay grinding achievements. 2 of them require some decent player skill along with a huge dose of luck to finish. (Double Rowdy and Pinball Wizard) The game never got in its way, and replayability is fun/easy enough to keep the hours reasonable and avoid a sense of tedium most of the time. (I left my game on a couple of times, so 48 hours is a gross overestimation of time needed. The hours take some time to figure out some of the pathways or cleverly hidden ones you need to track down.) submitted by /u/Zalym to r/steamachievements [link] [comments]",

The 4 from crew are basically free if you put in the time to find a max lvl crew in here that will let ya stay a week and help you out. Rookie 5 and 100 lifetime challenges also only take a week maybe 2. Basically its easy enough to get at least 7. My buddy got the game a week ago and has 10 already. This is basically a meta 6'8 that I set up to only absolutely need like 4 cap breakers to be quite usable online but still has useful spots for future cap breakers so you don't just feel the need to make a new build once you get them. First 7 go on the handle/SWB for 86/80. After that, 3 on 3pt for 92. After that, mid range and pass acc are both really solid options. submitted by /u/Himdoood to r/NBA2k [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Hello! I have a genuine question and I hope some of you could maybe help. I have been dabling into game dev for a few years now. I never got serious. And just made assets or concepts, I just did it as a silly hobby. Now I wanna get a bit more serious and make a small game to release for free. And maybe gradually get more and more serious with it. The problem right now for me is that I barely have any time after work to do it. And working on the Weekends is not really an option, as I usually work 6 days a week and need one full day for chores and to recover mentally a bit. I know discipline is important. But I genuinely come home from work and sometimes just \"pass out\" (Example: came home from work yesterday and I sat down on the couch to take off my socks and literally passed out for like four hours. When I woke up it was already kinda late to start working on anything. I only managed to cook dinner, take a shower and feed the cat) My 9-5 is more like a 6-6 situation. Where I wake up around 5 to get ready for work, then arrive home in the evening around 6-ish. Depending on the chores I have to do, I end up \"losing\" a bunch of time on cooking or cleaning or washing or whatever house related chore. And that without even spending time to \"unwind\" (like watching a video or reading something) So how would you approach this? Anyone in a similar situation? Getting a new job is sadly not an option for me rn. I imagine I'm not the only one in the situation. So besides the very obvious \"discipline\" is there a way to manage something like this? like maybe splitting up the chores? I already try to do the more time consuming stuff on the weekend? Do you, guys, have a specific way to do things or a schedule? I am very thankful for your answers. submitted by /u/Beef-n-goo [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Hello! I have a genuine question and I hope some of you could maybe help. I have been dabling into game dev for a few years now. I never got serious. And just made assets or concepts, I just did it as a silly hobby. Now I wanna get a bit more serious and make a small game to release for free. And maybe gradually get more and more serious with it. The problem right now for me is that I barely have any time after work to do it. And working on the Weekends is not really an option, as I usually work 6 days a week and need one full day for chores and to recover mentally a bit. I know discipline is important. But I genuinely come home from work and sometimes just \"pass out\" (Example: came home from work yesterday and I sat down on the couch to take off my socks and literally passed out for like four hours. When I woke up it was already kinda late to start working on anything. I only managed to cook dinner, take a shower and feed the cat) My 9-5 is more like a 6-6 situation. Where I wake up around 5 to get ready for work, then arrive home in the evening around 6-ish. Depending on the chores I have to do, I end up \"losing\" a bunch of time on cooking or cleaning or washing or whatever house related chore. And that without even spending time to \"unwind\" (like watching a video or reading something) So how would you approach this? Anyone in a similar situation? Getting a new job is sadly not an option for me rn. I imagine I'm not the only one in the situation. So besides the very obvious \"discipline\" is there a way to manage something like this? like maybe splitting up the chores? I already try to do the more time consuming stuff on the weekend? Do you, guys, have a specific way to do things or a schedule? I am very thankful for your answers. submitted by /u/Beef-n-goo to r/gamedev [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Breakthrough! I'm happy to share - after weeks of thinkering - that moments ago I've found the solution to the \"Error code 18\" for Epic Games Red Dead Redemption 2 installed with NonSteamLaunchers in SteamOS. Or basically the tweaks to be able to run RDR2 with NSL. The great news is that it allows to run RDR2 directly, or via both launchers, in Desktop mode and Gaming mode. Whatever is preferred. Cloud saves, share game activity with friends and steam performance overlay all work when running RDR2 directly from Gaming mode. Also this saves money having to buy RDR2 a 2nd time on Steam, and no need to deal with Heroic or Lutris separately for just this game. I'll report the solution on ProtonDB as well. Summary: Rockstar and Epic launchers need to be installed from NSL (in same prefix folder ofcourse), latest GE-Proton10-29 (download via ProtonUp-Qt app) needs to be set (check force compatibility steam play) for both launchers ánd RDR2 game in Steam library, WINEDLLOVERRIDES=\"vulkan-1=n,b\" command needs to be added in the Epic launcher's launch options in Steam (do not add in RDR2 launch options!!!), Rockstar Launcher's launch options in Steam need to be copied in full and pasted in the RDR2 launch options in the Epic launcher game settings/properties!!!, in the file ../user/Documents/Rockstar../Settings/system.xml change the value for adapter to 1 but leave API value to DX12, now run RDR2 for first time in Desktop mode from Epic launcher, login via Rockstar Launcher and done. Hope this finds another! :) Cheers I've posted the solution at NSL GitHub too: https://github.com/moraroy/NonSteamLaunchers-On-Steam-Deck/issues/869 submitted by /u/ScubyFlying to r/SteamDeck [link] [comments]",

I've already built the whole thing IRL and displayed it at a LEGO exhibition last month. Seeing how positively people reacted to it made me realise I should at least try submitting it. Now, it’s already close to 200 supporters which has honestly blown me away. I did discover there’s another Crossy Road project already up — and I genuinely hope both get support, because it’s a game that means a lot to many people.

      "content": "I've been wondering about the performance difference in games where enemies are constantly creating and destroying instances of their state classes, versus an approach where enemies cache their state and simply reset the values when jumping back to a previously used state. I haven't tested it myself since I'm very new at all this and haven't really got the time at the moment, but my best guess is the former is more cpu intensive while the latter uses more ram. So as usual there isn't a \"best\" solution and it all depends on the needs of the game and its bottlenecks. Either way I'd like to read the opinions of experienced devs on the matter, maybe the caching is a bad idea, period, and the traditional way is always better, but due to recent performance-related issues with modded minecraft due to the garbage collector I'm inclined to think otherwise (or maybe that's just java and/or mimecraft's code jankiness). submitted by /u/Y-oshirin [link] [comments]",

(If you happen to be curious about any of this check my profile here and find my twitter profile and you can see what my games are there) In this example I'm demonstrating death/destruction effects on enemies. This is in a test room with test objects around, so don't take it too seriously, but I always liked how swords cut enemies in half in mega man zero so I took that idea and ran with it. Blunt weapons can smash them into tiny pieces. Crunching up enemies should be intrinsically rewarding and that's what I'm hoping people find when they eventually play it. edit: I'm sharing because it helps stay motivated but I'm always open to feedback if anyone has any! submitted by /u/thedeadsuit [link] [comments]",

In that respect, for example, the Pixel, with its seven years of updates, is unbeatable. So, if you buy a OnePlus, it will work perfectly for many years (my OnePlus 7 still runs like a dream today), but after five years, you'll have a fantastic phone without updates or security patches, making it insecure and, for many people, useless. So, I don't understand the point of making these phones so great and then not providing better support for them. From 2027 onwards in Europe will be required that the battery be easily replaceable by the user, and I hope that Europe will also promote progress in the updates. Of course, no one from OnePlus or OPPO will read this. submitted by /u/omgletmeregister to r/oneplus [link] [comments]",

It has been developed by a very small dev team, so we appreciate anyone who checked out the game - it's a true labor of love for us and we hope you will have fun in I Hate This Place!

      "content": "Hi everyone, I've been working on a proof-of-concept web app that lets you play PICO-8 multiplayer games online with your friends. PICO-8 multiplayer games are designed for local play and you need everyone physically on the same keyboard or controllers. There is no native way to make online multiplayer games in Pico-8. How It Works With PICO Party, one person hosts a room and everyone else joins with a 4-letter room code. The host's browser runs the actual PICO-8 game and streams frames to all players via a peer-to-peer connection (WebRTC). Remote players see the game in real-time and their inputs are sent back to the host, where they're injected directly into the PICO-8 runtime as if everyone was pressing keys on the same machine. Will work even if users are on different networks. This means any PICO-8 game with multiplayer support works out of the box . No cartridge modifications needed if your game uses standard btn() calls with the default bindings. You can play multi-cart games and also use play any custom game as long as you have a link to the .p8.png url. Players can play on mobile with touch controls: a virtual D-pad and action buttons. Great for playing with friends who only have their phone. Try it at: https://picoparty.io Submit Your Games! The current library is pretty small. I've basically just been adding games I have been playing with my friends. If you've made a multiplayer PICO-8 game (or know of one that would work well as long as it is Creative Commons 4.0 or you have the author's permission), I'd love to add it to the library. Just open a PR at https://github.com/dwjiang/pico-party-games with: Cartridge URL (.p8.png) Game name, author, description Player count (min/max) A few screenshots Once the code is merged, the change should trigger a deployment and you should be able to see your game in the app within minutes. Future Feature Ideas If there is interest, I can continue to develop the app. Some ideas that I have: Audio streaming - Currently only video/frame data is streamed. Working on getting game audio to remote players too Public lobbies - Find random players to game with Cartridge discoverability - Allow users to sort by popular/newly added cartridges Saving progress - Saving cartdata so users can continue previous sessions. If there's a feature you'd want, let me know. Feedback Welcome I would love to hear what you think, any bugs you find, or games you'd like to see added.

I did it because I wanted to support the community — both on Wayfarer and in Pokémon GO — especially in smaller towns where there are very few PokéStops. I put a lot of effort into my submissions because I actually care about improving the game for other players. What I don’t understand is why people like me get punished for supposedly “small mistakes,” many of which I strongly disagree with or which are simply not true. In the end, you receive a negative mark, and all motivation is gone. It feels incredibly discouraging. What makes this even worse is that there are clearly people who ignore criteria completely, submit low-quality or abusive content, or otherwise misuse the system — and they often seem to be overlooked and not punished at all. That is extremely frustrating. Instead of focusing on those who clearly break the rules, the system seems to target players who genuinely try to help. Because of this experience, I’m honestly at the point where I don’t feel like doing anything for the community anymore. And that’s the real shame here: the people who put in the most effort to improve the game, especially in rural or smaller areas, are the ones being pushed away. I think this is something the Wayfarer community and Niantic really need to reflect on, because this approach drives away the very players who want to contribute positively. submitted by /u/ugartecard to r/NianticWayfarer [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Hello everyone, I’m planning my upcoming indie game and I’d love your suggestions. The game is a story-driven experience where you play as a character who is short on money and opens a small store with their savings. The store does not do well, things start falling apart, and one day a mysterious guy approaches and asks: \"Wanna be the guy?\" From there, your character gets involved in all sorts of shady and interesting activities. You clean up crimes, complete jobs, and eventually build your own empire. Unlike typical tycoon games, everything is scripted like a story-driven AAA title. Every action and event is part of a carefully crafted narrative. Here is the thing. So far, it mostly feels like a walking simulator. I really do not want that, so I would love suggestions for mechanics that make the gameplay engaging while keeping it story-driven. Thanks so much for any feedback. submitted by /u/Creepy-Ear-5303 [link] [comments]",

Added ranked ladder, seasonal rewards, cosmetic marketplace Solo project Tech stack for the curious: iOS native (Swift/SwiftUI) Cloudflare Workers backend D1 database Real-time matchmaking At launch: 70+ characters (all free from start) 6 factions with unique clan bonuses 8-card decks, 2-4 min matches Cosmetic-only monetization 📱 Pre-order: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/elarion-aetherfall/id6754101666 2 days out.

The code conan decipher is so challenging that it hard stops many smart character's of fiction. The code conan originally received was in Japanese but in English it translate to this- \"I'm a major league slugger. This is the beginning of extended inning game...? It doesn't matter if you prepare a good stopper... I will turn around the game in the end...\" So here is conan deduction P1- Major league refers to a American baseball league. C1- The entire code must be decipher in English. P2- A good stopper in baseball refers to strong earned run average statistics or Era. C2- The abbreviation of earned run average is Era. P3- Extended innings game in baseball can also be called extra inning games. P4- If you remove Era from Extra it leaves XT. P5- if you put XT vertically and move 180 degree then it represent the Japanese Kanji 文. P6- Kanji 文 represent schools. C3- The bomb is in a school. Now, conan cuts the wire of the bomb in the elevator 3 second before it blast. It result in conan to not get the whole clue but the part of it which was EVIT(unlike the letter this was English even in original translation). P7- Evit turned around will come out as tive. C4- The whole word is actually detective with tive being it's last part. P8- Detective in Japanese is 探偵(Tantei) P9- Reversing 探偵(Tantei) gives you 偵探(Teitan). P10- There are school with teitan 偵探 in it. C5- Mixing P10 and C3 it comes out that the actual place of the bomb is teitan school. P11- There are 3 teitan schools. Elementary, middle and high school. P12- The culprit behind the bomb is targeting people in it attacks intentionally. P13- In winter only teitan high school is active cause of there exam. C6- The bomb is in Teitan high school. Tge reason why this deduction is so hard or good is cause there are no guesses, induction or abduction. Each step follow necessarily from the pervious. And it is also very hard as conan has to realise many thing during the deduction process like- \"MAJOR LEAGUER\" → TRANSLATE TO ENGLISH \"GOOD STOPPER\" → ERA → REMOVE FROM EXTRA → VISUAL ROTATION INTO KANJI \"EVIT\" ON A BOMB LCD PANEL → REVERSE DETECTIVE → JAPANESE REVERSAL → TEITAN And also conan was in extreme pressure while also psycoanalysing the bomber and he correctly deduced 2 separate cipher joining them flawlessly with a countdown.

      "content": "I'm making a Dungeon Crawler Rogue-Like using structure blocks, trial spawners, vaults, decorated pots and utilizing Loot Tables for all of my rewards found in the dungeon. But to actually make the game play like a Rogue-Like I'd love to have unlockable items. To my knowledge there's no way to modify a loot tables without going into the file and directly editing it. But if there is a way, that would be amazing. I had an idea to pull it off where if an item that isn't unlocked yet spawns, I can detect that and kill the entity and replace it with an unlocked item before the player picks it up. I'm not using Chests anywhere in the dungeon, so items will basically always exist as an entity at some point. But ideally, actually modifying the loot tables would be amazing. I'm not all the familiar with Loot Table Functions yet, I know how \"set_count\" works but that's kinda it. If a function could check an in-game Score, or something of the like, and then completely change the item, that would be awesome. Alternatively if it can't change what item it is, maybe it can change the other item data? Like enchantments, custom name, and custom attribute modifiers? That wouldn't be as good, but still really helpful. Thanks! submitted by /u/BenManGinger to r/MinecraftCommands [link] [comments]",

      "content": "First it was the CnD ult that used to stack heals, then it was 12 seconds ult Luna ult and now it's Gambit's ult. Now Loki isn't the broken per say, but his very existence makes these ultimates even worse to deal with \"Oh you're having trouble countering insert the OP support ult that comes with every season how about you do it twice!?\" Now for how I would fix this issue I must first put up an amazing example that just happened to me in a match. Friend is playing Loki and in overtime the enemy CnD ults. Now it would seem like the only option is to copy your other support and stall the game. Except....this genius bastard copies the enemy MAGNETO and takes out the CnD and their Bucky with his ultimate. Then proceeds to help our tanks push the other team away, winning us the match. Noe THIS! this is the type of playmaking you'de from a GOD OF MISCHIEF!! So to keep encouraging these type of plays, I would simply make it so the Loki's that copy ults from their tanks or dps get rewarded with stat buffs if they manage to get off a kill. Like: you double ult with your Punisher and manage to wipe away the Luna ult? Congrats now for 30 seconds you have increased damage and lowered cooldowns! Oh You copied your Strange and stunned and killed the diving Magik and Daredevil? now You have 200 overhealth and your runes get 100 more hp for 40 seconds! Oh you copied your strategist!??? you get nothing and your copied ult starts at 95% instead of the normal 100% I don't want to take away the option to just copy your other support, but instead i want to increase the value in making risky plays! You know, make the character trickier! submitted by /u/MedusaSucks68 to r/marvelrivals [link] [comments]",

For example, if you have a single stick and want to convert it into left/right impulses: var input = new Complex( state.ly, -state.lx); input *= Complex.Exp(Complex.ImaginaryOne * Math.Tau / 8); left = input.Real; right = input.Imaginary; As opposed to a dual stick control mechanism like: left = -state.ly; right = -state.ry; This is most likely to help in physics-based vehicle controls.

      "content": "Created an UpdatePartComponent step to begin to separate the physics update from the internal vehicle update logic. Moved RocketCore and RocketNozzle update logic from the physics loop to Rocket.UpdateRockets. Moved ResourceManager from RocketNozzle to RocketCore to increase the separation between core (internal) and nozzle (external) association. Added propellant mass flow rate to nozzle and core readouts. Fixed very excessive propellant usage due to a sign flip in the consumption logic. Created FxTemperature part component to drive emission and thin film intereference maps. For the moment, this is driven purely from nozzle temperatures. Added FxTemperature component to SubParts with models and components that support it. Removed ResetState() method from PartComponentStateful as it was no longer needed. Fixed a few bugs with higher order symmetrical editing, added a few bugs with higher order symmetrical editing. Swapping between symmetry orders with multiple layers of symmetry inheritence is still a bit touch and go. All in all, going in the right direction. Use PartComponent.TryGetFrom() in a few places where it's less verbose and updated some related doc comments. Added a method to get mutable access to part component states for serialization and UI-context modification. Fixed a case where part components would incorrectly think that they couldn't be updated, leading to emissive maps not working. Improved behavior of temperature emissivity sim, especially for engines at low throttle. Increased maximum temperature for thruster emissive by 1.75 times. Increased thruster emissive intensity. Merged Part and SubPart classes. This should allow us to simplify quite a bit of logic doubling. This is not meant change the player-facing functionality of Part vs SubPart in the game. Quite a bit of clean up is still needed and given the wide reaching changes unintentional regressions should be expected. Return individual TStates and TFxStates by reference instead of by value from PartComponentStateful.StateList. Added individual component and state getters to PartComponentStateful.StateUpdater to match the interface of PartComponentStateful.StateList. Moved the Tank processing from the old TankList to the new PartComponent/State system. Made hot path initialization for type updaters infallible to avoid the infectious complexity of null checking in the vehicle update task. Removed the isEditorUpdate flag for vehicle updates which no longer has a purpose. Created an InertMass part component and shifted readers to use that instead of the template. Added in missing part components from top-level parts. Removed unused PartTree.TotalSubstanceStorageVolume. Moved one last mass template reader over to the part component. Converted engine and thruster controllers into part components. Created a GetSubtreeComponents() function to iterate over all part components of a given type for a part and its sub parts. Fixed a few accessors in PartComponent.List which weren't returning the concrete component type correctly. Return sub parts as a span instead of a collection. Removed thruster/engine controller properties on PartTree. Converted the subtree components generator into a ref struct enumerator to avoid allocation and used it in an additional place. Removed some redundant code left over from tanks moving to part components. Moved some PartTree functionality out of the Part class into the PartTree class. Added a Split function to the PartTree class. Tightened access to the Parts list in PartTree so that it must go through PartTree functions so we can eliminate logic errors where other code outside this class could change the Parts list in the PartTree without performing other related logic in the PartTree. Changed the public Parts collection in PartTree to be a readonly span. Made the static part list on PartTree private. Marked two PartTree lists as readonly. Use GetSubtreeComponents() for inert mass display. Fixed some pipelines being mislabelled as 'Byte[]' Fixed potential issue in Physics IntegrateVelocityVerlet where mass properties were not set for initial state causing a mismatch between first derivatives and half-step derivatives. submitted by /u/panic_in_the_galaxy to r/kittenspaceagency [link] [comments]",

It’s hard to tell what’s a bug or just me being stupid when I’m unfamiliar with so much. I will definitely upgrade at 4.6.1, but wondering if my concerns are valid or just yeet it? If the concerns are valid, what are some guidelines to follow and pitfalls to watch out for if I wanted to upgrade now? submitted by /u/hammeredzombie [link] [comments]",

En especial con noticias recientes de que hasta parches están dañando SSDs y la situación de seguridad y vibe coding en Microsoft está terrible. La vara es que yo uso mi compu 99% para gaming. Tengo un setup relativamente high end. De hecho ya tengo una pequeña partición de Ubuntu que uso para varas de desarrollo y tengo un boot manager que hace default en Windows. Quiero consejos para migración...cual distro es buena para gaming? Cómo está la compatibilidad (juego principalmente en Steam pero también tengo algunos juegos retro en GOG) con Proton? Uno puede usar Proton para juegos que no son de Steam? Tengo entendido que jugar en linea es casi que imposible. Solo jugaba BF6 pero ya casi no, y siento que para eso puedo preservar una partición de Windows. Lo que quiero saber es si es posible \"invertir\" mi configuración de discos duros sin borrar muchas cosas. O sea, en vez de 500 gb de Ubuntu y 5tb de Windows, hacer 5tb de Ubuntu, eso puedo hacerlo o tengo que volarme las 2 instalaciones?

However when trying to move the camera around the viewport I noticed that it gets stuck moving in one direction when I press the key a bit longer. It seems that it \"caches\" the input and keeps using it to move. When I release the mouse button and select any kind of text field, the cached characters get immediately pasted there and the issue disappears until I try to do more stuff in viewport and the whole scenario repeats. It makes any learning almost impossible and really frustrating, as - for example - I cannot press a key to change transform if there is already some input stored. Have you seen this before? Do you know how can I fix this? The issue can be seen in this video . I have released the W key around 2nd second of the recording and kept moving with only RMB held. At the end you can see that \"wwwww\" was pasted into the text field at the bottom just as I selected it.

I read that the deadline has been extended to June 30, 2026, and that the work submitted in 2024 shouldn't have been carried over to the 2026 edition. However, when I opened my gradebook, I noticed that it also marked the 2024 work as valid submissions. Is this a bug? Or does it mean that the work completed in 2024 is also valid and doesn't need to be resubmitted? I know that learning is what matters, but honestly, in a difficult moment in my life, I'd like to be able to hold a concrete result in my hands as proof of my efforts, even if it's just a certificate.

It's got the standard 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi (no 5 GHz listed, which is interesting) and the label diagrams seem to show a top-loading dustbin, which would be a nice little convenience. Based on the 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi, I'm guessing this might be a new Q-series refresh or a mid-tier model rather than a new flagship S-series. Where do you all think a bot like this would fit into Roborock's current lineup?

      "content": "No links yet, just want some honest feedbacks. More about the game: Hundred Nights DIFU is a Chinese hell management simulation indie game where you get to manage how souls live in their afterlife. At its core, it has a lot of humor, some sense of cozyness, and a pure build & management gameplay. We take some gameplay inspirations from Two Point series, Prison Architect, and even Dyson Sphere Program. We are a small indie team of friends who share the same passion for game dev and simulation games. The game is still way too early in development stage but we do hope steam page and playtest will be up within this year (follow me for more updates!). So, what do you think of the capsule art we are preparing? 1 or 2 and why? If you have other ideas/feedbacks, please let us know! Much appreciated for all your feedbacks! submitted by /u/LeofromDiFu [link] [comments]",

Videći da su RAM cene otišle u kurac i moj trenutni laptop koji sam uzeo prošle godine (R5 6600H, RTX 3050, 16GB DDR5) dosta koči u većim projektima, mislio sam da uzmem upgrade. Razmišljao sam da uzmem Macbook Pro M4, sa pro M4 čipom, 512/24, našao sam neki od 2050e na KP. Pošto macbook apsolutno nije upgradable, mislio sam da se fokusiram na pro čip i više rama a za storage da uzmem barem neki eksterni SSD kasnije. Laptop koristim kao sekundarni/poslovni uređaj, imam računar kod kuće. Voleo bi takođe savete koje alate da koristim. Kontekst, radim game dev samostalno (Godot, Blender, FL Studio, itd) a u firmi radim C++ (Visual Studio), ponekad kotlin/javu (Gradle) pa me zanima da li ima neke razlike u alatima koje se koriste?

I've created a health component that handles health given/taken and death, and a health interface to handle communicating between characters. Basic stuff. I implemented the interface on the health component itself instead of on the characters. The idea being that any character I add the component to will already have the interface implemented. It works great, but (and maybe I'm over thinking this..) it feels slightly wrong somehow. In order to apply damage to a character, I need to [get components by interface] because the target implementing the interface is the health component of the character, not the character itself. Example in the comments as I couldn't add an image here. So basically my question is, does using the [get components by interface] function defeat the purpose of using the interface? submitted by /u/ShmodyP [link] [comments]",

As someone who is trying to get into the industry and having worked on short films, I can only imagine the amount of work this took. Hearing about it all on Distractiable and through videos doesn't compare to going through it and with the behind the scenes coming out, we all can tell how much love and creativity went into this. Audiences know when you've put in the work and you've tried your best for a project you love. The sound design, art, costuming, vfx, lightning- everything about it made me feel what I feel for movies when I was growing up. Real sets, seeing an actor engage with real props and the hard thing of writing something surrounding \"one location\". Really cool stuff. It's really inspiring seeing someone go from playing video games at their desk to making a feature length film, especially one that's self funded and is backed with so many people who support it. Just thought I would put it out there that this has really inspired me to go for things and make them happen. I loved the film and hope others also feel that spark of inspiration. submitted by /u/FijianGecko to r/Markiplier [link] [comments]",

Like all this time we basically had one less accessory slot because of the boots and now that accessory is free for more build customization. This feels especially good as a summoner because we have multiple basically obligatory accessories to wear because they offer minion slots. Even if making other items obsolete is the reason I dislike finch wings so much, this time it feels warranted because of the absolute grip hermes boots had on accessory builds all the time. Not only that, but they made me care about a mechanic I never even thought about up until now: ice slime block slide. It is so insanely fun. Now, they are a bit overpowered and I dread the day when they will probably be nerfed to the ground. submitted by /u/Poisson18 to r/Terraria [link] [comments]",

I put out a demo last year just to see how people would respond while I was still working on the full game. It didn’t turn out exactly how I imagined at the start, and I definitely ran into my own limits as a developer, but I’m okay with that. Maybe I’ll come back to it someday and see what I can improve. I hope someone out there has fun playing it. On to the next one! submitted by /u/DAMStudio_BR to u/DAMStudio_BR [link] [comments]",

Close to nill. We have tested for colorblindness, non-issue. We can match colors, put the red ones here (if we have a red one there). If we ask, where is the red one, he guesses every time, this applies to all colors. Sometimes working with letters, and given 3 choices, he will get them right... For instance which starts with g... \"Green\" and point to it. He knows black, and white, sometimes brown. Other than that, he pretty much never gets it right and instantly guesses a wrong color. Without questioning he would say \"pink!\" or \"the red light\" or \"blue and red make purple\" Any suggestions? Am I just over thinking it? I feel like he should know them by now. Chatgpt suggested working on just red, which we have been doing for a week and I still feel if I asked him what color \"some red object\" is, he'd get it wrong. submitted by /u/ctarb to r/homeschool [link] [comments]",

I want to expand my zoo, but I have exhibits where there are way too many animals, but I can't sell them or release them because they're almost all new babies. I can only put them in the trading post, so the trading post is clogged with animals. I can put the animals on contraceptives, but then they all die out unless I'm paying really close attention and then I have empty habitats. Even if I don't put ALL the animals on contraceptives. Is this it? Is this the game? Just monitoring the breeding of your zoo and trying to balance the population?

The scholarship and total debt I would be taking on is about the same at both. I'm from the northeast and have no problem settling in PA/Philly long term. I am currently leaning towards Temple due to its location in Philadelphia and its slightly higher ranking/reputation. Since I would already be living in the city for school, I imagine it will be easier to network and secure summer internships/work in Philly, and I know that Temple has great connections in the city. But there are things that make Penn State attractive (a major university, an extensive alumni network, a more secluded location to focus, and, to be completely honest, football/basketball games/being a BIG10 school). I know both are pretty close in the rankings (#50 v. #59), but University Park is kind of the “second campus” for Penn State. I am planning to visit both soon, but this sub has been a great resource throughout my process, and I would appreciate any input or thoughts! submitted by /u/Icy_Tourist6609 to r/OutsideT14lawschools [link] [comments]",

Working on an unannounced roguelike autobattler we keep running into the same dilemma with Slay the Spire 2 announced for March. When to announce the game? When to push your demo?

It is a roguelite with soulslike inspired combat, where you will play as a knight, an archer and a mage, each with their skills, strengths and weaknesses. My ideia for an engaging combat is to apply some rules I personally learned from playing some souls games, like no cancellation animation, stamina management, lock-on on enemies, well-timed parries, dodges and skill activations. In the efforts to make the combat work with multiple enemies, it ended up with some free flow flavor. Hope you enjoy it, any feedback is welcome, specially on the combat itself. submitted by /u/John_X_MacTaviX [link] [comments]",

Seems some people draw shadows and put them on a layer so they can toggle them on and off but then confuses me how they can make the shadow adapt to different surfaces. Other method I saw was duplicating the asset, flipping it and using a shader to turn it into a shadow so they can rotate it for a day cycle but that seems rather complex to make it look good. Anyways sorry I know this has been asked but couldn’t find much info if the latest Unity engine can speed up this process. submitted by /u/owlsmoke [link] [comments]",

      "content": "So I am making a game that is in 3D, but needs to look like a 2D top-down viewpoint (currently achieved with an orthographic camera at a 45-degree downward angle, plus an altered camera projection matrix courtesy of huwpascoe's pull request. The sprite is y-billboarded towards the camera. Because the game is viewed from a top-down angle, I drew the sprites in that manner. However, for animations like the one pictured (walking south), the feet moving forward in space is visually represented by the pixels being drawn lower on the sprite, which makes them clip through the ground. https://preview.redd.it/rh5fcr2dnjgg1.png?width=292&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ff2c9fbec530d301621d42689ce7adba0461219 In this picture, I show this clipping along the edge of a floor, so you can see both the sprite clipping through the floor and the edge of the floor revealing the underside of the sprite. I need to find a way to allow the part of the sprite that clips under the floor to still be visible, without causing the sprite to become visible through other objects that SHOULD block the view, like walls. For a while, my solution was to make the sprite be offset towards the camera equally along the Y and Z axes, which wouldn't appear in the camera view, but long-term, I think this workaround could still come back to bite me, like if I wanted to ever include proper shadows and lighting, it would reveal that the sprite is hovering. https://preview.redd.it/8mm8ke7rnjgg1.png?width=384&format=png&auto=webp&s=313703c9fb49b406ebec97802186646db39001a2 https://preview.redd.it/eqbsyygrnjgg1.png?width=687&format=png&auto=webp&s=a5ba5be8a84cd85bf12c3c7a8a862eb05f9645db Pictured above are screenshots of the full 128x128 character pixel canvas being filled with a test texture so you can see the extent of the sprite canvas on the AnimatedSprite3D, as well as what the player object looks like in the engine viewport.

The kind of response that smooths things over and keeps everything comfortable. I felt it form automatically. The right words, the reassuring tone, the version of myself that makes things easier for others. This time, I didn’t say it. I stayed quiet longer than felt polite. The silence was uncomfortable, but it was honest. Saying what was expected would have meant setting aside something I wasn’t ready to dismiss. Eventually, the conversation moved on without the reassurance I would usually give. Nothing exploded. Nothing broke. What stayed with me was realizing how often I trade honesty for harmony without even noticing. I’m still figuring out where that balance should be, but choosing not to perform that moment felt like a small boundary I hadn’t known I was allowed to have. submitted by /u/Rich_Outcome8649 to r/self [link] [comments]",

I worked for my daughters first year and have been home the last year and a half. Recently I’ve really realized the flow of the home, weather the house is happy and flowing or chaotic if really down to me as the wife, mom, and home maker. I have an incredibly helpful husband but he goes in to weekend flow mode because that’s what he knows. He’s been home the last 10 weeks with me and new baby. The magic of Christmas and making memories is down to me as mom. It all feels a little intimidating realizing that it feels like I always have to be a step ahead, on my A Game , getting up early, and planning ahead to be a good present mom who has the time play with my two little kids. It’s a constant crazy balancing act and if I’m not always on and going the systems fall apart. How are other moms handling this?? For reference we live in a very small old space and we cloth diaper and cloth paper towels to save money, no paper plates. So there is always laundry, dishes , always fighting old house smell, constant pick up due to no play room. Toys are in strategic bins all around our small house. submitted by /u/SMFKT_99_17_21 to r/CatholicWomen [link] [comments]",

In Persona 5 I guess this would translate to how much of the compendium could you fill via recruiting persona's and fusing them together before you send the calling card for each palace? I know technically it's possible to reach level 99 in kamoshida (o7 to YourBudTevin for the grind) so hypothetically is there ever a point in which you would run out of fusions to make only having the pool of kamoshida to work with from the start? submitted by /u/Alex_Drewskie to r/Persona5 [link] [comments]",

      "content": "I’m looking to get a fitting at club champion (due to gift card there specifically). Initially I was only planning to use the driver fitting in order to get shaft specs that fit my swing more. The current promo lets you use the fitting price as a credit towards a club. I have 3 year old fitted irons currently, but feel like I would benefit from a fitting as my handicap has dropped from a ~18 > 9 at this point. I’ve never had a driver/wood, hybrid, wedge, or putter fitting. The gift card I have is $180, enough for a driver fitting without the promotional sale ($50 if buying a custom club). The fitting price for a full bag, with the purchase of a new club, is $100. An idea I had was the use this promotional period to get a full bag fitting for “cheap”, and then use my $180 gift card to buy the cheapest club that would make me qualify for the promo. So my question to the community is, how much do you think the cheapest custom club purchase would be? I’ve read that they have all those extra costly fees like the build fee and the “puring” fee. I’m just trying to weigh the difference in pricing and whether to just use the gift card for a normal driver fitting without the discount and paying for a club, or taking advantage of the full bag fitting opportunity. TLDR- what’s the cheapest custom club purchase that I can make at club champion in order to take advantage of the full bag fitting promotion for $100 submitted by /u/Solid-Drop-2780 to r/golf [link] [comments]",

I know Mikan feels like she would be a waste of a survivor slot so if they were thinking of making her a survivor, I feel like they might have to make her more useful throughout the game and build more confidence for herself throughout the trials and potentially help our protagonist out as like a support of sorts In summary: Im PRAYING for mikan being a survivor but something is telling she might be a victim. leaning towards Survivor Most upvoted character gets to be talked about tomorrow Make your predictions for Mikan, too if you so please. submitted by /u/OneDragonfruit8042 to r/DanganAndChaos [link] [comments]",

I've run into a problem: my assets are 1.4 MB, but when I convert my project to an APK, the size jumps to 25 MB. I know it's small, but it's the first version and has almost nothing. I've seen games with many more features that are only around 3-5 MB. Also, I can't use the library optimizer because I can't use Gradle (if you ask, I only used 8 ARM, and my game's APK is 25 MB). My game code is only 99 lines long, and I only use 2D; I didn't use a character body in the project. Note: I developed it in Godot 4.5.1 on a mobile device. submitted by /u/t_l_h_anonny [link] [comments]",

A lot of speculation has surfaced about this ending, such as you needing a perfect performance to complete (or the complete opposite, a terrible performance), attempting to romance Malevola, or aceing every single hacking sequence (including the optional ones). I was wondering if anyone had tried just not choosing any responses when you're able? Not sure if anyone knew this, but if you let the decision timer run out, it just picks a decision for you, and though I haven't tested it, I think it might be possible this isn't random, which leads me to think a possible way to get the ending is literally do nothing.

      "content": "In the mid-long term future, I plan to leave my job in a western studio and start a western-style indie PC games studio in Asia. Not sure what's a best investment until then, learning Chinese or Japanese (traveled to both). As for China: Future stability . Risk of war/economical-visa restrictions/ possible VPN law changes for the Great Firewall. Easier chinese visas, less starting capital required. Harder to get visa-free residency. But Japan's future leans right-wing and anti immigration. Content restrictions are only an issue if selling to the Chinese market (same restrictions for a company in the west selling to Chinese citizens). Much easier to hire/fire talent in China (bigger talent pool, applicants more open to small remote-first studios, lower cost of life/salaries, much much easier to fire a bad hire that would kill the company in a small japanese bootstrapped indie project). Japan talent pool has a worse demographic future. Worse opportunities for outside investment for games. I'm planning to bootstrap with savings, but don't want to close doors to future investment. Chinese publishers invest first in mobile/multiplayer (at least now), not my focus. Western publishers avoid Chinese companies due to worse intellectual property/legal protections. This is usually handled by keeping intellectual property and cash in an empty US Holding Company that outsources development to the Chinese one, but might be too much friction/risk for western investors. China is worse for selling the company. For a western publisher looking to acquire, even if the intellectual property is in the US holding company, it seems like a risk to buy a Chinese dev team that can go dark with a VPN law change. Long-term life/culture. China feels easier to integrate into. Prefer the bustle and hustle rather than the japanese zen with slow grind. Immigrants in Japan struggle to feel \"accepted\". Should I learn Chinese or Japanese during these previous years? China looks better for bootstrapped indies and lifestyle, Japan better for established/publisher focused big companies. submitted by /u/SavingClippy to r/AskAChinese [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Hey everyone! I'm trying to create a compositor effect in 4.5 that processes the color buffer based on stencil buffer values (doing custom highlight and outline effects). I've followed the 'The Compositor' tutorial in the docs, and got things set up the color buffer. So for the next step I've tried to add the depth buffer(1.) and it isn't going well. I thought I could follow the same pattern as using the color buffer in my shader. So in the glsl code I declare my buffer uniforms like so: layout(rgba16f, binding = 0, set = 0) uniform image2D color_tex; layout(rgba16f, binding = 1, set = 0) uniform image2D depth_tex; And in the script I fetch the buffers create uniforms/set as follows: var color_buffer = render_scene_buffers.get_color_layer(view) var color_uniform: RDUniform = RDUniform.new() color_uniform.uniform_type = RenderingDevice.UNIFORM_TYPE_IMAGE color_uniform.binding = 0 color_uniform.add_id(color_buffer) var depth_buffer = render_scene_buffers.get_depth_layer(view) var depth_uniform: RDUniform = RDUniform.new() depth_uniform.uniform_type = RenderingDevice.UNIFORM_TYPE_IMAGE depth_uniform.binding = 1 depth_uniform.add_id(depth_buffer) var uniform_set = UniformSetCacheRD.get_cache(shader, 0, [ color_uniform, depth_uniform ]) The shader compiles just fine. But when I run the script I get a few errors repeating every frame, the first one being ERROR: Image (binding: 1, index 0) needs the TEXTURE_USAGE_STORAGE_BIT usage flag set in order to be used as uniform. Now I'm not sure why I get this error for the depth buffer uniform and not the color buffer. I tried bitwise or'ing the TEXTURE_USAGE_STORAGE_BIT (so depth_uniform.uniform_type = RenderingDevice.UNIFORM_TYPE_IMAGE | TEXTURE_USAGE_STORAGE_BIT ), but that gave me an error stating that the uniform_type value was out of bounds. So I'm not really sure where I am going wrong. Clearly I am misunderstanding something. Is anyone able to point me in the right direction to figuring this out? submitted by /u/FernwehSmith [link] [comments]",

SFA is constantly insulting me and my intellect, so is the post-burn timeline which never should have picked up in another series. I see 2 options: either we come together and pull off some kind of blitzkrieg legal battle, which eventually forces Paramount (or whichever subsidiary is on charge right now) to never release another episode of that clusterfuck of emotional molestation. This might be hard to do, given the fact that they already dared to release 4 episodes, with a fifth one due for next week. Even if we hire the most slaughter-ready lawyers it might be to late to make them stop. The other more sane, more effective option would be to have someone on the inside who identifies all digital copies, production files and master images of that show and make them go away without a chance of restoration. This would need some kind of administrative access, and of course a person with lots of honor and selflessness. There are times when people are implored to act by their fellow civil brothers and sisters. This time is now. Only Paramount superusers can stop the destruction of our franchise. Yes if we delete all SFA copies now, there’d be still the 4 episodes floating around but they can always be considered to be a tragic example of selfish corporate media frenzy, an attack on fandom itself.

Not mechanically but I am going to delve into some pretty reprehensible topics. Vile darkness etc.... I always ask players to let me know what is off limits. I do not wish to make people uncomfortable as I have very few limits myself. Most my players are the limit. I have no issues with really abhorrent things if it's done for the right reasons and not just shock value (Though sometimes that is a good thing). I find myself running into too many players saying they have no limits then going. HEY! That's too far!. It's too far I get it. We won't pursue this. Why did you not tell me this before? It would not have come up? Does anyone else have this problem? I run games about violence and its consequences among other such things such as power dynamics. This shit is dark and I refuse to glorify it. Why can't people just be honest? So many problems can be avoided. I am not talking about the really obviously avoided things. It's the smaller stuff that is setting them off. Players if you have a problem with a topic and the GM and you are asked PLEASE be honest and say so that way it does not come up. I am not a fan of X-Cards or even doing these kinds of checks ins since people lie but I don't know what to do at this point. No one seems to have a problem until they do. When asked \"Why didn't you say I would have happily avoided it?\" They go this shit is disturbing why would you go there and I am like I am using it BECAUSE it's disturbing. I want to face this. All of my writing is very personal and my last game I wrote essentially consisted of a me writing about coping with suicidal ideation and moving through it and never say those words but the professional health workers I played with picked up on it immediately. Tell the DM if you can't handle the topic. Don't lie and say you can. Please... I know some times we thinkwe can but discover we cannot but I have heard too many times now.

Bonus points for making her relevant in the NEXT patch, thus making this argument kind of obsolete. What if they randomly decided to give Vivian a swimsuit skin in OCTOBER, but NOT Miyabi, who as an ice character would (probably) be able to resist the cold. Bonus points if they acknowledge the fact that it was weird for them to do that since it was no longer summer time. What if they gave literal NPCs, characters that you literally CAN'T PLAY AS and thus won't be able to see as much, a skin, but NOT the VERY playable Hoshimi Miyabi. Bonus for giving them to NPCs that are actually popular, which would give this point less traction. What if they gave PAN FUCKING YINHU, a character who probably has like 5 fans, a skin, but NOT Miyabi, who is one of if not the MOST popular character in the game.

Australium Weapons are reskins of weapons to look like solid gold (technically Australium but it looks like gold.), and needles to say they look extremely cool. How would you get one you ask?

All for at best a 5% chance per TOUR to get an Australium Weapon. Yareli (Warframe). Yareli was a Warframe in the game that while not necessarily optimal, was very fashionable and unique. How do you get it? By completing an hours long quest line requiring you to perform extremly difficult tricks on a K-Drive, a rather Niche mechanic that (up until then), no one had any reason to use. I heard that it was made much easier, but I still will never get back the hours I spent on that quest. Characters in any any HoyoVerse game. The characters in all hoyoverse games often have very unique character designs, backstories, and great voice actors. However, to get these characters you either have to spend absurd amounts of money, or grind the most tedious, insanity inducing tasks for weeks on end to save up enough of whatever in-game currency to get any reasonable chance of getting ONE character. This is completely ignoring all the things you have to do to make the character optimal, which requires more grinding and oftentimes spending even more on gacha to get the character's weapons and other characters for good team composition. submitted by /u/WHATISREDDIT7890 to r/TopCharacterTropes [link] [comments]",

On top of that, a lot of Taobao or Alibaba links either bug out or don’t show up at all, and even tracking and QC pics have been hit or miss. It’s getting pretty frustrating to deal with. I decided to try Hipobuy after their recent site update, and it’s actually way more convenient than I expected. You can use cnfans links directly on Hipobuy without converting them, and cnfans spreadsheets seem to work fine too. The whole site just feels smoother and more reliable overall. They also brought back 30% off shipping coupons, which is nice. On top of that, if you forward your packages from the cnfans warehouse to Hipobuy, they pay for your domestic shipping, which is kind of crazy. I haven’t really seen another agent offer something like that before. With all the issues going on with cnfans, switching to Hipobuy honestly feels like the logical move at this point.

Use NordVPN normally for up to 30 days. If you don’t want to keep it, just request a refund & they process it without hassle. That’s how people are getting both the lowest price and a risk free trial. I wasn’t sure at first, but I tried it myself and it worked fine. Important Note: Skip “coupon code” sites.

This also allows them to leave the dark world and enter different ones without turning to stone, and it works like yinyang, the knight is yin, and ralsei is yang (alot of people make the mistakr of thinking that yin is the white).

      "content": "Some time ago I brought my plan for a Pokémon Fanfic, and I'm here to talk about another topic. I'll leave the link to the post for you to read. This time I want to say that I intend to adapt the two Pokémon Legends games, and I wanted to show my proposals. Legends Arceus: The story will tell the origin of the Fujiwara Family, and of the one who started it all, Christopher Fujiwara. He was a character of unknown origin who was chosen by Arceus and as a bonus received a natural gift for Aura, something that his descendants would inherit and improve. And in the future it is revealed that Christopher married Akari. Legends ZA: This one is still in the planning phase, but the biggest difference is that the game will take place 20 to 25 years after XY, to show my characters older, married and with children, including my OCs, and the protagonists being precisely those children. But it's also an idea that I might apply to the Tenth Region, but that may depend a lot on how it turns out. Soon I intend to make a post talking about the love interests of my OCs, but for now I would like to know what you thought of these ideas for the Legends Saga. submitted by /u/UsualWishbone4416 to r/pokemonfanfiction [link] [comments]",

      "content": "About three years ago I was making a music video and found I really liked environmental storytelling and world building. I decided my next project would be a video game. Since I already had quite a bit of experience in Blender and virtually none in any game engines I decided I’d figure out a development approach that lets me do most of the heavy-lifting in Blender. That’s how I ended up with a game that is 90% pre-rendered. The overworld backgrounds, the cutscenes and even the turn-based combat is all pre-rendered. It’s a bit of a nightmare to work with at times but I’m really happy with the result. The way I’d describe the game itself is a mix of Disco Elysium, Fear and Hunger, Look Outside and Bioshock. For the Disco Elysium inspiration, I wanted to create a world that felt truly lived-in with lively dynamic characters who are shaped by the world they inhabit. It also has a similar system for handling skill checks and there being multiple solutions to quests. For Fear and Hunger and Look Outside, this is the exploration, scavenging and combat elements of the game. I was especially inspired by the unique encounter design in Look Outside. Bioshock is a huge inspiration for the setting. I’ve wanted more games set in doomed underwater cities so I decided to go out and make my own.

      "content": "Hi! We’re a tiny team making a cinematic psychological horror game: Untold Memories: Potter’s Field. You start as a cemetery night watch, monitoring CCTV for “anomalies” — but the more you watch, the more it feels like the cemetery is watching back. What begins as a job slowly turns into punishment. What to expect: • CCTV/surveillance loop + investigation (you eventually have to go outside) • Story-first psychological horror (guilt, memory, revenge) • Atmosphere over cheap jumpscares Demo is live. If you’re into slow-burn horror, a Steam wishlist helps us a ton. Steam page + demo link in the comments. Question: do you prefer CCTV-style horror, night-shift horror, or story-driven psychological horror? submitted by /u/Barisimsi [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Good tidnings, everyone! I'm new to gamedev and Godot and trying to learn gamedev by breaking down some mechanics from different games. Here's the question: How do you change gravity vector of a CharacterBody3D? I know that RigidBody3D can do so via collision with Area3D, but I want to make it independent , so I can stick my character to any wall I want. I thought about this kind of a solution: When change-gravity-button is pressed, a collision sphere gets first collision and its normal and sends it to gravity component, where it then interpolates character global position to collision point global position, counts difference between floor and character in angles and rotates it so player is perpendicular to the floor, and whenever we change walking surface the algorithm repeats submitted by /u/murdered_ronin [link] [comments]",

      "content": "I had an experience in Warzone that honestly crossed a line for me, and I think this is something the developers need to look at from a design perspective. A player used the hostage/carry mechanic in a way that visually resembled a sexual assault scenario, undeniably. I know the intent of the mechanic is tactical and gameplay-driven, but the way character models animate and how players can position themselves makes it very easy for someone to create something that looks extremely disturbing and inappropriate. Player downed me, took me hostage and took me to the corner of the wall simulating rape action. It triggered my PTSD! This isn’t about trash talk or normal toxicity — this is about how a gameplay animation can be misused to simulate something horrific. It caught me off guard and genuinely made me uncomfortable. I’m not blaming the game for player behavior, but I do think this is an unintended visual outcome of the mechanic that should be reviewed. Small animation or positioning restrictions could prevent this from happening without affecting gameplay. Has anyone else seen this? And how can we get this in front of the devs so they can adjust the mechanic? I’ve reported the player, but I think this is a design oversight that deserves attention. submitted by /u/Aggressive_Bill_2822 to r/Warzone [link] [comments]",

How do you manage financially while working on your games? For you, is game dev a side hustle/ hobby, or are you trying to make it full time?

For the last year and a bit, I shifted into working on a major project and I am finding that instead of playing the game to look for bugs/improvements, I have been playing for the high score/ to experiment with builds and just for fun generally. It's a really cool feeling getting to enjoy a game and realizing that it's something you made yourself and any ideas you have can be implemented. I've never experienced something like it before and I'm wondering if this feeling stays after you release your games or if this is a feeling that is consistent with every major project you work on? submitted by /u/BeesAreCoolAlsoAnts to r/gamedev [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Hi everyone. I’ve been working for quite a while on a platform called Homespace ( https://store.steampowered.com/app/2508170/Homespace/ ). The core idea is that players build virtual homes and then play mini-games inside them. Recently, I decided to make a key focus of the project the idea that Unreal Engine developers could create their own mini-games, publish them, and sell them within our platform. It seems to me that creating mini-games is much easier than developing full-fledged games — even small indie ones — and if we already have an audience, this could be a very low-barrier entry point for developers. Moreover, we could provide an additional source of income for level and mini-game creators. And on a broader level, even if hardcore Unreal developers aren’t particularly interested, we’d still be lowering the entry barrier to game development for regular users — encouraging them to start experimenting with Unreal and even coding if they want to do so within our ecosystem. What do you think about this idea? Am I right in this assumption, and does it make sense to implement something like this at all? submitted by /u/General-Lock-1079 [link] [comments]",

After I conquered my video game addiction in my mid teens and started actually socialising they were dissappointed in me and continued to pressure me to do IT courses which I hated. I told my father that he basically enabled my video game addiction which ruined my childhood and early teens and yet hes still in denial. Well at least I actually did became a video editor/camereman at a local TV station but obviously the pay isnt as great as software devs but I'm happy and I get to meet interesting people, also being an attractive man sorrounded by mostly female colleagues feels great to say the least, haha.

Right now, it’s hard to build any plan tactics with club members. Adding a dedicated chat space would help players mentor each other and stay active. It’s the one missing piece to making clubs feel like a true community rather than just a list of names. Any chance this is on the roadmap?

If a Magician is shot while deflecting, the bullet will be deflected back at the shooter and deal damage! This makes it great for deterring the aggressive playstyle of the Mule, and can create strong opportunities to get a free reload off when down in the count. I'm super excited to keep showing off more of the game when the time is right. I've put a lot of heart into this game, so I want to make sure I give it a proper launch. 😁 Let me know if you have any other class ideas you think would be cool to see in game! submitted by /u/Calm_Salamander_2447 to r/rblxoutlaws [link] [comments]",

It's a horrible map in that regard. I avoid it. Your modding community has shown more love and care for the game than you do. You just rake in the money and let them make the game for you. You should be ashamed of yourselves. Genuinely consider giving the game to the modding community. You clearly have done so in a less literal sense. You take suggestions(which are insanely easy to code and take little to no effort), and put them \"under consideration\" for years. It's depressing. Please get your s*** together. I've never had this many issues with a game in my LIFE. Not even THE SIMS 2 ON A MODERN PC has given me this many issues. It's easier to reinstall the Sims 2 from the ground up than to run POT.

I don’t mind supporting the game, but this doesn’t feel very player-friendly. If you agree, I’d encourage sending feedback in-game about the event and pass prices.

For the card game, I used opposing and matching elements instead of numbers. There's also a round element, and whoever has the most of that element's icon on the board at the end of the round gets a bonus. Tried to make it as self-explanatory as I could while still providing multiple avenues for points and victories.

I needed to destroy the object but to leave the PS for all of the particles to die beforehand. I tried destroying the model first, and then particle system, however it was not possible because while trying to destroy the children of cloned object I got an error telling me that I am trying do destroy prefabs. But doing so with the parent object (which was instantiated) works. I tried unparenting the PS as the tutorial showed, using transform.parent = null. But the error popped up saying the parrent cannot be null. I will try to just make two separate objects one with model and one with particle system and instantiate them. But it feels a bit clanky? Is there any other solution and am I missing something? Thanks in advance :) P.s.

In the winter, instead of the power station, I connect the LED lights directly to the truck’s starter battery using an always-hot cigarette outlet that I installed in the truck bed. With this setup, I’m not getting any power to the lights, and I’m not sure why. I know the cigarette outlet itself works because I use it to charge my portable power station. That makes me think the issue is either: • a voltage incompatibility, or. • the cable I’m using to connect the LED lights to the outlet. The LEDs are connected using a 5.5 × 2.1 mm (5521) to male cigarette lighter cable. This cable works in other setups and outlets, but I’m wondering if there’s something about this specific outlet, connection, or voltage that’s preventing the lights from powering on.

      "content": "Sharing two pawns I made based on the Vermundian Soldiers we see roaming about. I shared the Fighter before, but the Mage one I completed just awhile ago. Took me awhile, but I'm quite happy with how they turned out. They are both low level and equipped with gear from the early game that I believe some Vermundian Soldiers use, but it's all fully upgraded so they should be able to handle even Battahl and Volcanic Island given the chance. Here are their \"specs\": ---- -Vernia Female Figther (level 21) Calm Inclination Skills: Burst Strike, Cloudward Slash, Hindsight Sweep, Full Moon Slash ID: 7RHJ1Z18M2H4 ---- -Baenlin Male Mage (level 20) Kindhearted Inclination Skills: High Halidom, High Celerity, High Palladium, Lightning Affinity ID: JLC5D7QYUXX4 (Vermundian mages usually only cast Flagration and Fire Boon, but I don't think that would make a very fun pawn to have around, so I gave him some different skills). ---- If anyone fancies having some Vermundian soldiers for pawns, here they are. In case you hire any of them, hope it's to your liking! I also want to, eventually, create an Archer Vermundian Pawn, but creating these, even with the help of a late game safe file, is a bit time consuming, so maybe an idea for another time. In any case, if you feel I can improve them in any way, I'm open to suggestions too. Cheers! submitted by /u/m8-wutisdis to r/DragonsDogma2 [link] [comments]",

I'm talking about youtube content creators that play tons of games and highlight the best parts. They have not only a love for playing games, that many of us do, but also of sharing and building community around it. They are a crucial part for games to get out there in hands of people that may like them. When I reached out to them, they were more than helpful, kind and appreciative.

Now normally I wouldnt even be mad and sad cuz it's just a game, but those pets were all gifts that my girlfriend made to me. She sacrificed many pets in her account, even things she loved Just for getting me some pets i likes. And now, all my pets, all her sacrifices: GONE. I dont even know this guy/girl. I dont even remember playing with him in a server. I dont even wake up at 6 AM, I wake up a 7 AM. Now i feel mad, and sad, and most of all, i feel like i broke a promise, and despite all the times She told me \"it's not your fault\", i still think it's my fault. Maybe if i decided to login earlier something would've changed. Maybe if i decided to transfer my pets to another account this could've been avoided. I Hope that my report will be seen and that this story will be ready, and that this scum of a human being Will be banned, over and over and over and over and over. Thank you for your time. -Qbic (AKA Fakeranni) (NOTE: I never asked her for pets, She just gave them to me, not even knowing if i wanted them or not, and this makes me even more mad.

      "content": "There seems to be an obsession with adding online multiplayer to every game. At this point, it feels like every game is expected to have online features, but honestly, I think a lot of players struggle to find people to play with, and many of us don’t want to sit in a lobby listening to a horde of screaming kids. Making VR games is already difficult for indie devs, and supporting online multiplayer makes it even harder, and most importantly, it often results in less overall content. I could give many examples, but take Battle Talent for instance. It’s one of my favorite VR games: it has tons of systems, lots of enemy types, lots of weapons, etc. The devs have been pushing updates for a long time, which is great, and those updates are genuinely impressive. But over the past year they’ve been focusing heavily on online features, and personally I lost interest, while still thinking adding more core content could really transform this indie title into something totally unmatched in VR. Another example is Undead Citadel, which had a relatively lukewarm launch. Many people were disappointed by the amount of contents (not the gameplay itself), and now it looks like the team is working on a “multiplayer update.” Honestly, I just hope they add more than multiplayer (and from what I’ve seen, it seems they will). Online play, sandbox modes, mod support… all of that is nice to have. But to me, it’s more like the icing on the cake, not the cake itself. How do you guys feel? Is it just me coping because I have no friends, or do you also miss content-heavy single-player games? submitted by /u/Enculin to r/VRGaming [link] [comments]",

I'd like to avoid this. My first instinct would be to put an underscore before the parameter, e.g.: func _init(_character: Character) -> void: character = _character But, using an underscore on a parameter is the indicator to Godot to ignore unused parameters... so I don't want to use an underscore here. My next instinct would be to put a $ before the parameter, e.g.: ``` This is NOT valid code func _init($character: Character) -> void: character = $character ``` But $ have a special meaning in Godot and are not valid characters in a parameter name. Unfortunately, the official style guide also doesn't mention anything about this. Anyone have any clever, clean, universal approaches to this problem? submitted by /u/samanime [link] [comments]",

      "content": "I’ve always found this take that Luka would have multiple rings if he was on the Celtics to be flawed for many reasons: Preventing player development: Luka Doncic, a player that’s very ball dominant would likely mean the Celtics guard duo of Derrick White and Payton Pritchard wouldn’t have been able to develop into the players they are today because of Luka’s usage rate. Defensive liability: The Celtics built their championship team around the idea that their starting 5 players could switch onto an opposing player and defend them to a decent degree. With Luka on the court teams would have an immediate weak link to hunt on offense. Disrupts the Celtics balanced attack: The Celtics championship run consisted of multiple players that could get 20 points a game and with Luka’s usage you would’ve definitely seen less games where Porzingis or Jrue would’ve been able to showcase their offensive talent. It would’ve also made the five-out offense less reliable as most of the three-point shot attempts would be coming from one guy making the Celtics a more predictable team. This is further shown by the struggles he had playing with Porzingis. Similarly, would Jalen Brunson take the jump to the next level if he was still playing with the mavericks and Luka. This is not me arguing that Jayson Tatum could’ve taken Luka’s 2024 mavericks to the finals but I believe people often try to use this argument to prove that one player only wins because of their roster rather than understand how a player is able to fit and adapt to a system which matters more in determining the success they’d have on that team. submitted by /u/Majestic-Web-367 to r/NBATalk [link] [comments]",

That’s insane. The little fuckers are impossible because only dismemberment seems to do the job, but given most weapons at man-at-arms and above are focussed on bludgeoning - this becomes an absolute chore. Not to mention even when all their bones are broken and they’re just lying there, they still don’t count as a kill, even if they can’t get up or do anything. This, on top of the fact that the larger weapons all feel like wiffle bats and are terrible at cutting now - makes the abyss by far the worst part of the game. What are your opinions on the abyss?

You can use cnfans links directly on Hipobuy without converting them, and cnfans spreadsheets seem to work fine too. The whole site just feels smoother and more reliable overall.

Problem is, I have zero industry contacts and honestly, no time or interest in becoming a marketing expert. I just want to write and build. In 2026, is it still possible to get visibility for a high concept narrative game based solely on the quality of the 'Hook' and the story?

      "content": "In episode 16 of Gnosia, Remnan worries about being caught running away unlawfully and being captured if the D.Q.O. goes to a base. I've finished the game too, so I know that in it, his concern is rather about having to \"see\" someone. I'm curious about any theories/reasoning for the reasons for his concern in the anime. Is running away unlawfully really that big of a concern? Even if he left a planet without going through the correct process, this is because he escaped slavery. Wouldn't an exception be made? Or is he simply worried about the process of having to clarify this? Alternatively, if he ran away illegally, this could imply that slavery is legal in Gnosia, or has different legalities depending on the planet. However, I always figured Manan kept Remnan secret from anyone outside of her trusted circle. In the game, his worry about having to see someone is very vague, but from his events and general demeanor, the player is naturally made to think about Manan. It would make sense that, if he reported to a military base, she could possibly find out and track him down, at least in his POV. What do you all think? I'm open to discussion regarding this. Either way, it was nice to finally have a Remnan and Raqio moment adapted to the anime. submitted by /u/proboty to r/Gnosia_ [link] [comments]",

I've been developing a game for a few weeks now and releasing regular free, playable versions (though they're pretty rudimentary) and promoting them on x and bsky. I'm getting some engagement on both platforms, but so far nobody has downloaded my game to play. I'm honestly not expecting in-depth analysis of the game or anything, just some basic stuff like \"it feels slow\" or \"it's frustrating\" would be helpful. Or even just to catch bugs I may have missed. I understand asking someone to download and run an exe from a stranger on social media is a big ask, so is there a better place to ask for that kind of thing? Can I host my dev builds somewhere more trustworthy than a google drive link, distributed via a discord server? submitted by /u/Cudabear to r/gamedev [link] [comments]",

No matter what settings I use there's this ghosting on the item I'm holding and everything becomes blurry whenever I move and it's making me dizzy and hurting my eyes. The only time the ghosting and blur when moving is gone is when I use FXAA. But now I have a new problem where everything is too sharp. The clip I uploaded is just me showing the blur and ghosting I'm talking about but I've tried doing dlss on and off, full screen, windowed etc. I tried limiting fps, turning the motion blur on and off, global illumination on and off, going from low to ultra settings. But nothing changes. It's still blurry and has that ghosting effect except for when I use fxaa which makes everything too sharp and still makes my eyes hurt. Outside the settings I've also tried the compatability mode I've seen people suggesting in the forums but still it has this same effect. I tried searching for solutions but not much people seem to be having the same issues as me. Thank you for the help in advance.

Any advice on the difference between these 2?Exactly the same specs so I guess it comes down to MOBO, BIOS etc. The optional external liquid cooling for Erazer is tempting, but I know HP is super reliable (upgrading from an Omen 17 2060 which has lasted amazingly well with no issues since 2019). submitted by /u/Maxijak1 to r/GamingLaptops [link] [comments]",

      "content": "I'm not super knowledgeable on Godot so I apologize if this comes off silly. I'm currently making a pool game and I'm trying to make it so that the game will show your ball's trajectory, and if it collided with a ball it'll show the direction of where the hit ball would go. Originally I tried getting the direction like this but it wasn't super accurate var target_direction = (hit_position - self.global_position).normalized() bounce_line_2d.add_point(collider.global_position) bounce_line_2d.add_point(hit_position + target_direction * 200) Using the normal is closer but still inaccurate if shape_cast_2d.is_colliding(): var hit_position = shape_cast_2d.get_collision_point(0) var normal = shape_cast_2d.get_collision_normal(0) var collider = shape_cast_2d.get_collider(0) trajectory_line_2d.add_point(self.global_position) trajectory_line_2d.add_point(hit_position) collision_preview.global_position = hit_position collision_preview.visible = true if collider.is_in_group(\"balls\"): var target_direction = -normal bounce_line_2d.add_point(collider.global_position) bounce_line_2d.add_point(collider.global_position + target_direction * 200) The balls are rigid bodies and to detect collision im using a shape cast that's the same size as the ball. If anyone has any insight on this please let me know I'd greatly appreciate it. submitted by /u/_Abox [link] [comments]",

I’ve been recording and mixing for a while now (I can track 10+ live instruments in my studio), but I’m looking to diversify my portfolio specifically in the indie game and media world. Since I’m focused on building a solid \"reference list\" right now, I’m offering high-quality mix and mastering services at a very flexible/entry-level budget. Whether it’s a single track, a podcast, or game SFX, I’d love to help your project sound professional. I’m obsessed with getting that \"punchy\" sound right. If you have something that needs a professional touch without the high studio costs, let's chat! Cheers! submitted by /u/selcukhantras to r/Music [link] [comments]",

There are plenty of things they could do or could've done to prevent this but it's more than obvious they had no intentions of saving this game otherwise we'd have seen that effort. submitted by /u/PhotosByZane to r/OnePunchManWorldGame [link] [comments]",

Frankly, I don't see any other game series that would be so good and so frequent with their releases (although frequent releases arguably became an issue lately, but still) You may consider it a toxic positivity, but I'm aware of all the flaws of the series for the past six or so months, and I don't like any of that as well. It's just that RGG Studio is still the best dev team in my eyes, as they have set the bar quite high, hence I'm still excited for new releases How do you feel about Yakuza series regardless of its state right now?

However I noticed with the \"process call : physics\" my character was not having problems but the other elements moving (the cars in this case) were jittering a little when my character (thus the camera) were moving. When I put the process call to Idle, my character was jittering since I use the physics process, but the cars werent. Is there a way to fix the issue other than using physics process on the cars since they don't really need physics ? Thank you ! https://preview.redd.it/2m213jiyyxgg1.png?width=961&format=png&auto=webp&s=d888b3e09ee74d240d79cec68e8cf3c86db051fc https://reddit.com/link/1qt9li8/video/fpmo37uuyxgg1/player submitted by /u/Xayou [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Idk who needs to hear this but: I know we all roll our eyes at the “I can fix him” thing when it comes to women trying to rehabilitate toxic men, but I think a lot of us are still susceptible to the notion that if we just love our female or nb partners hard enough they will finally, eventually treat us right. …Sorry to say but, they probably won’t. If your partner consistently does things that hurt you or make you feel insecure or undervalued, *love will not change them.* If your gut tells you they’re maybe just kind of with you until they find someone “better,” you cannot love them into loving you fully. If they rant to you about how horrible all their ex partners & friends are — *you are not a break in the cycle, you’re just on the next loop-de-loop* — If it’s that many people, it’s not their exes, it’s not you: it’s them. I know we all want to believe that people can change, and trust me - I know how difficult it is to cut the cord when someone alternates hurtful behavior with lovebombing - when you keep seeing flashes of the person you wish they’d be. That’s often enough to keep people trapped in bad relationships for years. But if any part of this resonates with you, please try to take it to heart that you deserve better. You have to be a kind and patient person in order to want to help “fix” a broken person, but you may be breaking yourself in the process without even realizing it. You’re not a bad person for walking away from a toxic situation. I promise there is a better relationship out there, with someone who will actually appreciate and return the love and kindness you are currently pouring into ((whoever they are)) submitted by /u/uta_refson to r/actuallesbians [link] [comments]",

Rule #1 - only 1 suggestion per person and comment Rule #2 - no downvoting Rule #3 - we won't limited ourselves to just clowns, jesters, mimes and the like are all welcome Rule #4 - NO HORROR OR KILLER CLOWNS!!! Rule #5 - with your suggestion, make sure you add their name and franchise they're from (you'll get a bonus upvotes if you include an image or gif) Rule #6 - evil clowns, are welcome, however! if you want to add an evil clown, make sure to ask yourself \"why are they a clown?\" do they like to perform? do they like to make others laugh? do they enjoy smiling? Rule #7 - a friendly clown is always welcome, even if their reason for being a clown is questionable Rule #8 - groups are welcome, just make sure that the group itself has an official name Rule #9 - if there's a tie, a wheel will be spun (yesterday, Keheheh Kekerakera and Piedmon had the same amount of votes) Rule #10 - fan made clowns aren't allowed ---------- side note: everytime I mention clown in the rules, I also mean jesters and mimes tip: this entire roster idea, is based on the video, \"Top Ten Video Game Clowns\" by The Green Scorpion, so you can watch that video to get a better idea submitted by /u/MinimumPotential6468 to r/createaroster [link] [comments]",

This is what happens when you grew up in 80s NYC clubs: Area, The Tunnel, Visage, The Palladium - - - and you refuse to settle for algorithmic bullshit. This is me spanning 50 YEARS of music (yes, fifty) because I'm genre agnostic and I don't care what decade it came from if it makes me FEEL like a woman, not a demographic. You won't find force-fed \"empowerment anthems\" here, no drunk-girl-screaming playlist everyone makes, nothing that sounds like it came from a focus group. What you WILL find is Blondie's \"Call Me\" from 1980 sitting right next to Peggy Gou's \"(It Goes Like) Nanana\" from 2023. You'll find Basia -- BASIA, because who the heck remembers her? I do. You'll find Laufey's \"From The Start\" making you swoon before Purple Disco Machine makes you move. Grace Jones, Donna Summer, CHIC—the queens who taught the game. WAR and Earth, Wind & Fire because sometimes you need funk, not feelings. Chappell Roan and RAYE because good music doesn't have an expiration date. This playlist is for the women who know that Fleetwood Mac's \"Everywhere\" from 1987 still hits you different every time, who can dance to Sheila B. Devotion's French disco , who appreciate that Lianne La Havas and Jessie Ware exist, who remember when Madonna made music that mattered, who understand that Dua Lipa's \"Levitating\" belongs right next to Michael Jackson's \"Rock With You.\" This isn't a nostalgia trip and it's not a \"new music\" playlist.

While I did put good time into it, I positively do not want to even look at it anymore, it is like a child I am ashamed of. Anyways now I just kinda sit here with a blank unity project thinking \"what next?\". I want to make something small so enough I can finish but not too long that I lose interest. Any suggestions for getting started or workflow? submitted by /u/zueM [link] [comments]",

I am wanting to play something that isn't the lightest wargame in the world but would be alright for someone interested in strategy but new to the concept. I really want to get 2 sets of travel battle and combine them to make a 40 inch length 10 inch depth field of battle, since it works for my space. My question is, I understand that the native rulesets are very light, and that it is the rules that really make the war game and not the pieces. What, if any, are good, but not grognard complex, rulesets appliable to travel battle and this scale?

Even though it's early access, it's an amazing game that seriously has infinite potential. As someone that has loved playing games all his life and never had anything giving me the feeling that Skyrim and Minecraft gave me back in the day, Hytale comes pretty darn close. In fact it is so good, I really want to put my life into its progression! I started to learn coding/ modding a bit, created the first 2-3 mob/npc designs with animations and already created several Al's for ingame behaviour. Sadly I have no qualifications on paper whatsoever, only my work that's been done. Does anyone know, how the Hytale/ Hypixel team could see me? I have infinite ideas, infinite time and an infinite desire for this project. Even though I am nothing special obviously. I don't even need nearly the salary they promised to employees, I'd be happy with less than half of what people earn there. Just want to be a part of something amazing for once I'll add pictures of the creations below, I made them completely from 0, no templates, no help. (Please keep in mind, I started modding, designing, blockbench and animating on blockbench 3 days ago..)

As we journey through life, it's crucial to have a roadmap and milestones to guide us toward success. This month, we're drawing inspiration from the book that has sparked many transformative journeys - \"The One Thing\" by Gary Keller and Jay Papasan. ​ **The Power of Focusing on \"The One Thing\"** ​ In \"The One Thing,\" Keller and Papasan emphasize the importance of clarity, focus, and prioritization when it comes to achieving your goals. They advocate for finding that \"one thing\" that, when accomplished, will make everything else easier or unnecessary. This concept can be a game-changer in our quest for success. ​ **Monthly Challenge: Define Your \"One Thing\"** ​ Here's our challenge for this month: Take some time to reflect on your goals, whether they're related to your career, personal life, or health. What is that one thing that, if accomplished, would have the most significant positive impact on your journey? ​ - Write it down. - Break it into actionable steps. - Create a timeline. ​ By doing this, you'll have a clear, actionable plan for moving closer to your goals, step by step. ​ **Share Your Insights** ​ We encourage you to share your thoughts, experiences, and progress throughout the month. Have you read \"The One Thing,\" and if so, how has it influenced your approach to goal-setting and achievement? ​ Remember, every journey begins with a single step. Let's take those steps together and support each other in making our dreams a reality. 🚀💪 ​ Stay tuned for more inspiration and motivation as we work toward our \"one thing\" this month! submitted by /u/AutoModerator to r/MarketingOneZeroOne [link] [comments]",

I already finished the game and unlocked the Goat content. However, in the in-game tarot list it still shows 66 out of 85 tarot cards, and the trophy for collecting all tarot cards hasn’t unlocked yet. There os no ??? Card slot, all show some tarot card. I’m playing the base version from PS Plus (no DLC purchased). I dont known what I missing. Maybe some specific tarot cards that have special unlock condition. I’m also missing the last two follower forms in the list, I’d really appreciate clarification where to get them. At this point I just want to make sure: What exactly counts toward the 85 tarot cards? What cards até mandadory for the trophie? Is there any known PS5 / PS Plus version issue I should know about? Any guidance would be hugely appreciated — I’m so close to the platinum and don’t want to miss it before the game leaves PS Plus.

I mean every Call of Duty or Battlefield, Medal of Honor or other current shooters can be seen in so many different YouTube compilations that show how sound effects always vary a bit from sequel to sequel - even if is the same weapon type. But why? Is it a copyrights thing, is it for the sake of the sound designer's creative approach to always make new alternative sounds for every follow-up of a shooter game? Has this topic been discussed anywhere or is there a documentary about it? What do you think why this is?

It's a slightly different backroom than usual: the levels, some of which are very similar to those of Backrooms' creepypasta, but others have never been seen but imagined by me or inspired by movies and series or events that actually happened. It's a horror platformer, inspired, you have to look for keys and take coins (the latter is currently a beta), with monsters or levels where you have to overcome some platforms or with puzzles and much more. It's still in early access, but I'd like to make it perfect, and that's why it's in early access, so I'll listen to advice and improvements. The game currently has 10 levels, but I estimate that it will reach 50 or a maximum of 100 levels. Also, for now, the game is in single-player, but I'm already working on multiplayer. I'm also working on a new mode that will be one of the few backroom games that allow you to do this, I don't want to do spoilers, but it will be cool and I want to create a real community about my backroom game. I'll give you a preview of the first level, I want to assure you that this game is a platformer, but it's not just a platformer, we'll also have to solve puzzles, run away from monsters and much more, because I don't want a static game that's dynamic and full of things and choices.

      "content": "I have played so many shooters over the last 30 years that I find it fascinating how often the sound designers tend to create always variations of a gun shot sound effect for firing a gun of a specific type (like an AK47 or Glock). I mean every Call of Duty or Battlefield, Medal of Honor or other current shooters can be seen in so many different YouTube compilations that show how sound effects always vary a bit from sequel to sequel - even if is the same weapon type. But why? Is it a copyrights thing, is it for the sake of the sound designer's creative approach to always make new alternative sounds for every follow-up of a shooter game? Has this topic been discussed anywhere or is there a documentary about it? What do you think why this is? I find it highly fascinating how you can see AK47s in 10 different games and each one sounds slightly different. submitted by /u/GAME-PHYSICS-by-DNMN to r/gamedev [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Hi, I’m currently working on a ghost function. In my game, the player only moves along one axis (X). What I’ve done is: on Tick, I store the X location each frame in a float array. Then I load that back on the next run. What I’ve noticed is that if the FPS drops in the first round, then the playback won’t be accurate on the second. I’m pretty sure this is because Tick is FPS-dependent. So I’m wondering: is there any way to do some sort of multi-threaded tick that runs independently from FPS? Is “Set Timer by Event” the same as Tick, or would that solve my problem? Or would it help if I only stored the X value every half a second (like calling it every 0.5s)? submitted by /u/Efficient-Regular-30 [link] [comments]",

My problem with most of them is that they are goals, but they are given in the form of advice, like \"put your own needs first\", \"learn to say no\", \"set boundaries\", \"learn about who you are and what you want\", \"focus on yourself\", etc. I hear these and some other ones a LOT and they already make me feel horrible for not being capable of doing them. I haven't gone a full week without shutting down for days, there's absolutely no way I can take care of myself or do basic household chores (or even get up and walk to the bathroom). I'd just be doing chores in a terrible state, with nothing changing, eventually feeling worse. \"Put your own needs first\" is a good goal, but actually doing that leads to more small traumas for me. Absolutely none of these do anything for me. I feel like the emptiness has taken over too much. I've never been able to function. I saw an EMDR therapist for the first time today (just the assessment) and we're starting the work in 2 weeks. I shut down as soon as I got home for unrelated reasons (people in uni). I need something to WORK and make me feel a little better until I see some results from EMDR. submitted by /u/Voroojac to r/emotionalneglect [link] [comments]",

New Vegas is basically supposed to be the Wild West so why would you live in there and want to be bossed around and taxed by some jarhead liberals? Do you even need the protection/extortion? The Mojave is full of extremely powerful guns basically lying around everywhere in the open. You do not need soldiers to protect you. The NCR npcs are also extremely annoying and aggressive and demand you submit to their fake government authority. At least The Enclave are actually descendants of the original USA government. They have a sort of more legitimate authority even if it is evil. NCR on the other hand are just some libs from California who all of the sudden decided they have a right to rule the entire wasteland. Who made you God? I don’t think anyone voted for the NCR. The game shills them so hard even the devs wore NCR shirts at E3. NCR is obviously a self insert of the devs WOKE libtard ideology and if you choose not to side with them you will have EVIL karma. “Oh but what about the Legion? They are more evil so you have to side with the NCR.” Exactly the same logic the fake left uses to just supporting the democrats every single election. At least the Legion is trying something different from the same ideology that destroyed the entire planet. “but the legion r fascist!!!!1” Oh and NCR are not? Nope NCR are just as much fascist Nazis. They want to bring back the same imperialism usa does. Also it’s clear the devs made the Legion as comically evil as possible to try and force you into supporting the NCR. Nice try libtards. I always side with the Legion anyway. It is more fun to LARP as Juba the Sniper and pwn imperialist NCR skkkum. Now on a another note aesthetically they are also objectively the worst faction. Their uniforms look absolutely hideous. Also forgot to mention Boone is such an overrated and terrible character. He is basically Chris Kyle The American Sniper. A pathetic emo who never shuts up about his stupid wife. lol so edgy, cringe, gross, hateful and vengeful nasty character. He tries to portray himself as some sort of poor ptsd vet hurt by war yet he obviously is a psychopath who just loves violence and killing. Like if you were so morally good you wouldn’t choose to be a sniper merc and follow the courier around killing as many people as possible. This is a character made for people who have a punisher skull on their F150. Boone SUCKS. There are absolutely no redeeming qualities whatsoever about the NCR they are the worst faction to side with for the wasteland. The only faction that comes close to being as bad is the Followers of The Apocalypse who are basically like IRL radlib anarchists who shill for the NCR/Democrat party. The Followers are basically useful idiots for the NCR and do everything they want. WOKE libtard nazis DESTROYED with FACTS and LOGIC. submitted by /u/Sweet-Ad-7887 to r/TrueAnon [link] [comments]",

      "content": "My game features 1 scene of consensual choking where a person asks to be choked. Since my game has been released UK law has changed or is changing to ban depictions of choking. Steam are no longer letting adult games update after their release. This means you cannot go in and change content that isn't bug-fixes. Their justification is that they have to review adult games to ensure they are compliant. Devs could sneak in non-compliant stuff through updates. My problem is that I'm not being permitted to remove the choking scene from my game which could break UK law. What am I supposed to do here? Do I really have to take my whole game off Steam? Am I liable to get in trouble over something I produced before the law changed? If I remove my game from Steam I'm going to be losing tens of thousands of dollars in sales. submitted by /u/IllUniversity9595 to r/LegalAdviceUK [link] [comments]",

What we’re suggesting is not “ unnecessary” it’s the bare minimum for realistic college football equipment in 2026. And before anybody starts crying “gameplay first” we AGREE. Gameplay glitches need to be fixed and on field gameplay should be elite. But let’s stop acting like it’s one or the other. EA uses different dev teams for different aspects of the game. The people working on gameplay aren’t the same ones handling player models, uniforms, accessories, and customization. Both can be improved. It’s honestly weird how some of y’all think immersive customization “takes away” from the game. Nobody trashes gameplay suggestions so why force hate on customization requests? It makes no sense. If you want your players wearing outdated or basic gear, cool. That option will still be there. But what’s wrong with letting the people who actually care about customization have the freedom to use newer, more realistic options? Choice doesn’t hurt anyone it only makes the game better. Right now we can’t even equip half the stuff real college athletes wear every Saturday. In a game that’s supposed to be a realistic college football experience, that’s unacceptable.

      "content": "I have been developing a single player offline fitness game for Iphone were you level up by walking in real life. My game functions alot differently than the other options currently as it is casual freindly. It's probably similiar to Melvor Idle. Im going to be having an open beta soon join WalkWorld for more info . Features: 5 skills (2.5 million steps worth of content which will always be free) Should work with Apple watches immediately (reads Apple Healthkit for step data) Inventory, leveling, and progression similiar to Runescape No inventory limit, no traveling, and you spend steps like a currency after your walk. Feedback appreciated. https://preview.redd.it/ig73l2gz9bhg1.png?width=323&format=png&auto=webp&s=ef38d40a13535f13cf300f3f8c9ac7becbae596e https://preview.redd.it/zpf5fax0abhg1.png?width=322&format=png&auto=webp&s=3d8ed9638bd58a8e8a5c75b82c3ddbe76e8bf456 https://preview.redd.it/uvxxvsu1abhg1.png?width=327&format=png&auto=webp&s=f625571251114c0810242c4fe7d9ca10d0ae3111 submitted by /u/GreenWizard56 [link] [comments]",

People here often criticize others for wanting better graphics, saying the graphics are “fine.” I’d be totally fine with that if they actually added anything else that was meaningful. Road to the Show, Franchise, Stadium Creator, etc. have been stagnant for years. What exactly are the devs spending their time on? Adding a few Diamond Dynasty cards and college teams? Is that really it? I would be more than happy to accept a trade-off of better graphics in exchange for fewer new features, or new features at the expense of graphics. The problem is we’re getting neither. They’re a business. They obviously want to maximize profits. So stop rewarding them with your $80 for what is essentially a roster update. submitted by /u/Remote_Plastic_8692 to r/MLBTheShow [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Hey everyone, we’re a small indie team working on a grim dark roguelike, and we’re getting close to our vertical slice. Which is exciting, but also the moment where every decision starts to feel permanent… and slightly terrifying. Before locking ourselves into choices we might regret later, we put together a short survey to get some outside perspective. It touches things like difficulty, punishment, narrative weight, atmosphere, and also the less fun but very real side of indie dev like marketing, discovery, and why players actually trust or wishlist a game. We don’t have a publisher or safety net, so this kind of feedback genuinely helps us avoid shooting ourselves in the foot. The survey is in English, anonymous, and doesn’t take forever. Link here: https://bewdbros.studio/forms/helpusbuildourgame If you feel like helping a fellow indie team make slightly fewer bad decisions, we’d really appreciate it. And if anything interesting comes out of it, we’re happy to share what we learned. Thanks, and good luck surviving your own vertical slice.
