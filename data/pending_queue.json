      "content": "Just this simple question. Why : button.pressed.connect(doSomething) function doSomething() x = x + 1 end And not : if button.clicked == true then x = x + 1 end As far as I know, the first one (events) helps with decoupling things easier. The second one though is deterministic and acts on states. I know some people still use the second option but... why all courses insist on using only the first method as the ultimate truth?

      "content": "I'm at the half of volume 2, and I enjoyed the series so far, it's obviously just fun escapism, but there are hints of literary merit here and there. But now something is really bothering me, why is everyone suddenly gay ? The usual explanation for such convenient coincidences coming to be was that it was set in a game world, which kind of worked I guess. But now, Manaria is gay ? Misha is gay ? A random nun is gay ? Mc's previous life classmates were gay ? Yu has queer stuff going on ? How does this make any sense ? I literally can't name a single 'average' straight woman in that series. Maybe Lene ? But she's also in love with her brother for some reason. Maybe MC's mom ? But she's a pervert. Maybe the homophobic maid ? I guess, but I wouldn't be surprised if she ended up gay too. At this point I'm unsure how the kingdom is surviving with such a ratio of gay people. I'm just asking : is this series going to continue trying to be a bit more than comfortable yuri-themed escapism ? Will it continue trying to be a good story ? Or will it take the yuri-slop route ? submitted by /u/Then_Search_1719 to r/WataOshi [link] [comments]",

      "content": "I’ve played DnD going on now 6 years and I thought it was high time I took up the helm of dming my first campaign! We’re running Beyond the Witchlight right now and I cannot express how much fun I had with our session 0 and session 1. As someone who has been a player for a while, I didn’t expect me to enjoy dming as much as I do? (If that makes any sense?) Here are some of the highlights of the campaign so far without getting to much into spoilers for later - My players first and foremost are amazing!! I have 6 players (one of which is my dm friend who gave me tips and tricks before I decided to run this) - Their backstories are so much fun to read! Especially since almost all of them have some sad backstory and there incomes my boyfriend who is playing a spoiled noble Paladin tabaxi who is intending to be our comic relief! - we decided to run the a mix of the Warlock’s Quest and the Lost Things hook and I am so glad I did cause roleplaying as Madryck Roloff (who btw I accidentally made him sound like Nicolas Cage’s Dracula from Renfeild), our party is shipping him and his patron which I thought was funny so I’m going with it!! - before the game properly started I asked my players to write rumors about themselves and I split those rumors amongst the party to encourage roleplay! And during the first session they started bringing those up and it caused a little chaos to get to know one another! One of the rumors was our fairy child, Cloud’s. His rumor was that his butler still reads him bedtime stories and the group started teasing him about it and ough I wish I recorded it cause I don’t think typing could do it justice! All in all I’m so so so happy to be having my group and this being my first experience dming! Thanks for reading! submitted by /u/strawberry_p4ncakess to r/DnD [link] [comments]",

I don't even care whether it's only for the cameras but unpopular opinion, atleast he's taking a stand for his connection every chance he gets. Nevertheless, he absolutely gets on my nerve, why is he mansplaining all the time? Ofc the show is rigged but atleast show some sort of humility, he thinks he's owning the game but the truth is he's just dumb. Just because he applies his own stupid logic everywhere and talks slow, it doesn't make him strategic player. And also I might be narrow minded for this, even I have guy friends but I don't hug my guy friends like that specially if I have a connection or if I'm quite literally friends with that guy's connection. It was very very weird to me. I kinda felt bad for Anuska today. I mean yes she's overconfident and goes over the top but the way Mohit treated her was not okay. She literally came back, and he's laughing at comments passed at her and stating he's not happy she's back infront of the entire villa to witness. I can only imagine how humiliating that must have been. Even if he was pissed off by her and didn't trust her which was okay fair enough but that was a discussion to be had privately. Even when they were talking he didn't stop bis friends from mocking her which didn't sit right with me. Maybe he's insecure because she takes the limelight or smtg, idk bruh. And Idk but I need to say this, Anuska literally feels like Harsh, main sher hu sher 🤣 Very happy that Khushi got dumped. But chalo I think I understand why Kaira cried so it was bad to troll her on that. Chahe jaise bhi hoh atleast they have a friendship.

Theater of the mind preferred. I need to take a few days to finish up reading Dreadful Doomscales I don't mind mixing content into either game. EZD6: Dreadful Doomscapes with vehicles sounds fun! EZD6: Wasted World with EZD6 items (or vice versa) sound cool too! Or monsters! Sound cool to mix up either way! It’s not a requirement to mix content by the way. My Playstyle: • The RR and Fellow Players Need to Have Fun While the players need to have fun, the RR needs to have fun too. Without a RR there is no game. I make sure the RR and my fellow players are having fun. • I Love Your Cool Factor My Dude! I sell like a wrestler. By that I try to make sure the RR and PCs to get to feel cool. • I Ask Probing Questions Say your PC or NPC has a water bottle she always carries around. I may ask a question about it. I become a fan of the character as a player, “Tell me, where did you get your prize of yours, jugger? It seems important to you. Was it a gift?” Or perhaps your character has an unorthodox fighting style, “Ya know, the way you move it seems like a snake slithering in the sands. You ambush like a predator; one minute your afar with your sniper rifle and then your up close and personal with a wrench.” I tend back to jewl, my dune buggy, the Crimson Fang. I gaze upon your scars as you pull down your sand-covered goggles. I look to my buggies battered gas tank and back at your scars, and sigh. I Share the Spotlight I constantly pass the spotlight. While I do like the spotlight, and gravitate towards leadership roles I make sure everyone gets a chance to shine even the RR. I believe if everyone is interested in each other’s characters it creates a more enjoyable experience. I'm Always In Character I interact with the world and it's NPCs to learn more about it. I also never ask the RR questions directly to do things. I only do. I noticed it speeds up the game a lot and helps keep everyone immersed. I love immersion. I prefer I have control of my own character. I don't mind control effects. I don't like it when my RR says stuff like, “You feel angry.” “A deep sadness sweeps over you.” I may surprise the party and/of how my character feels. I don't want that to get ruined. Kick Down the Door. I'm Not Waiting. While I don't mind planning, if the game comes to a halt, Im pushing the action forward. I'm kicking down the door. We only got a limited amount of time to play and in game resources. Food and water will run out. Monsters and enemies act and react without the party. Image from a Redditer.

You know those projects you were super excited about… bought the domain, built the MVP, maybe even got some traffic… and then life happened? Do you just let them sit there and slowly die? Or is there actually a market for “almost there” projects? I’ve got a few small sites parked on the side. They’re not huge, not revenue machines, but they have unlocked potential — decent domains, some SEO groundwork, a bit of structure. Feels wasteful to just let them rot. Has anyone here successfully sold a small side project for cheap just to pass the torch? If yes: Where did you list it? Is there a subreddit for this? A marketplace for tiny indie projects? Or do people just DM each other and figure it out? Would love to hear real experiences, the good, the bad, and the ugly. Feels like there should be a better “second life” ecosystem for abandoned indie projects.

This one feels bigger than it looks. There’s emotional weight here, not just logistics. 3️⃣ Content Model Skepticism (Post-Dropshipping) DTC owners burned by dropshipping are skeptical about pivoting to content-based models.

My friend suggested that maybe the page was confusing and that’s why it was happening so we decided to simplify it and made it even cleaner. But it did nothing the bounce rate was still at 62%.

If you don’t mind, can you send a screenshot?\" She forwarded me the SC. I could see all three tiers on her screenshot. They were right there. But then I noticed something. She was on a Motorola Edge so I asked her to try scrolling down and she said that she was scrolling but nothing was happening… Oh god!!!! We started to test it on real devices. The page looked complete. Then we tested it Motorola edge it was like everything was normal and we could see everything. But you literally couldn't scroll. It was happening because the CSS overflow: scroll just... didn't work. On Motorola phones specifically and users thought we only had one pricing tier because they couldn't see the other two. Approximately 12% of our mobile traffic was Motorola users for 5 weeks….Switched to a different scroll implementation. Tested it on actual real devices using drizz(dot)dev since we don't own every device and results were Speaking. The bounce rate dropped to 19% in 3 days.

      "content": "Hello, I have a bit of a dream to one day be able to work and have a career in engineering racecars. My country doesn't have an automotive sector, so I'm currently working in aerospace R&D and want to move over. For my current experience: I have a magna cum laude masters degree in mechanical engineering from the second best uni in my country, 2 years of experience working on development of orbital and ballistic rockets, jet engines, satellites, flex wings for drones, I have a lot of skills in part design, structural analysis and manufacture technology development, primarily working with composite materials. I also know pretty much every tool used in prototyping those things, autoclaves, CNC, winding machines, etc. I have no issue with moving to any European country, I know english, german, norwegian, polish, a bit of french and currently learning italian. I don't have a life and I don't plan on getting one so work hours don't phase me. My question is, what course of action would you suggest for me to take to eventually end up working on race cars? What country would you reccomend (I want to move out of mine anyways)? What companies are worth aiming for? Should I try to move up the ladder in a general automotive firm or try to shoot straight for a racing-related company? Edit: What skills should I focus on developing? submitted by /u/Grouchy_Schedule6577 to r/AutomotiveEngineering [link] [comments]",

      "content": "(Thought this gauntlet from Naruto looked cool so decided to turn it into a cursed tool) The Echo Speaker is a relatively new cursed tool that's found in the Gakuganji Clan made to amplify the Sound Amplification cursed technique the technique Yoshinobu has (the old guy with a guitar for those who forget). It can be used by people without the sound amplification technique but it's weaker. The Echo Speaker is a metal gauntlet with holes in it that the user would wear on their arm, and the holes are able to absorb sound waves while storing the sound waves in the gauntlet. The gauntlet can also amplify sound waves that are stored inside it, and ones that are made from the user's arm movements. The user can tell how many sound waves are stored in the gauntlet by how much it is vibrating. While the sound waves are stored in the gauntlet they are imbued with cursed energy this allows the user to direct the sound waves when they are released. Echo Speaker is so durable that it can be used as a shield, and when it is struck the gauntlet absorbs the sound waves created. The user can release the sound waves through the air or through physical contact the sound waves released can be so loud that they can shatter stone or bones It all depends on how many sound waves are stored. In combat the wielders would absorb all the sound waves In the area leaving temporarily silence then either release the Sound waves through the air to blow out people's eardrums. Or either release the sound waves when in physical contact with something to shatter it with intense sound like releasing it through the ground to shatter it or release the sound waves into people to shred their organs. Without the sound amplification CT any sound released through the air wouldn't be loud enough to act as a physical force, and would require physical contact for real damage. If the user does have the sound Amplification CT then the Echo Speaker is much stronger as they can use their body as an amplifier alongside the gauntlet's natural amplification. This would remove the physical contact weakness, and allow for more mid or long ranges attacks. The user would be able to shred people with sound waves from a distance, or to shatter the ground or other materials without requiring physical contact. submitted by /u/Remote_Control_7661 to r/CTsandbox [link] [comments]",

I started my own SaaS - MakeOnlineCourse - a platform that helps everyone to create their own online course and start earn money online. I thought I hit the jackpot with that. As a course creator myself, I know how long it takes to think of a good idea, create the strcuture of the course, create the text, record myself, edit, narrate over some of it. It took me months. That's why I made my platform, which helps users with this process from A-Z, including getting the whole video courses in just minutes. Days pasted by and I've got very little amount of customers. I was losing money on ads and didn't knew what to do. Then it hits me. I have a platform that creates courses. Why wouldn't I just use it myself and sell my courses? That's what I did. That was my \"Aha\" moment. I started creating many courses and sold them online. This month, for the first time I made over 5K of \"passive\" income out of it, just by uploading them to the usual platforms. I know it's not a lot but as a start I thought it will be helpful to share that, as I was so blind to my own product this whole time, and just tried focusing on the income instead. Anyways, fill free to share your expirience and leave a comment with your SaaS. Waiting to see you also trying my platform!

She struggles with OCD and is 77 but she takes care of herself pretty well. I am grateful she allows me to stay with her even though it took me a few months to convince her. She is rude at times and clocks everything single thing I do and treats me like a child and interrupts me and my mom's conversations and makes everything about herself entirely and steals the conversation constantly. My mom is a huge support for me. Today I was showing my mom a trailer for my game which is important for me (because I have Autism) and my gran kept butting in and interrupting. It was frustrating because it was a 2 minute trailer. My mom had to run to the bathroom to pee so naturally I followed her to show her the last 15 seconds uninterrupted. My grandma came up behind me and tickled my waist which made me shake and get upset because most of my family knows that I have specific boundaries on being touched because I have trauma related to it. Also friends in my past have grabbed my shirt and pulled it back on my waist to \"accentuate\" it during P.E. in highschool to call me a 'twink' (I have body dysmorphia so that would really fuck me up). Naturally I got very upset because it was triggering and told her she is annoying and I dont like being touched and she started throwing a fit. She said it was just a joke and even my mother said I have a lot of trauma and I dont allow her to touch me either and im like that with everyone. My gran then got mad and was repeatedly apologizing in an unserious manner and said im no fun, basically invalidating how I feel. I then go to my room because I need to calm down and take time to myself. She then comes into my room and says \"You know im REALLY absolutely truly SORRY.\" and then I said \"Can you just leave me alone\" to which she then says \"Yeah but can you accept my apology first?\" and I said \"Why do I need to accept it right now?..\" Like what audacity does she have to not even give me a second to calm down?? And then obligating for me to accept her apology after she invalidated how I feel and how badly it triggers me?? Anyways so then she got mad at me saying that and said \"Wow so you dont accept it.\" then slammed my door and said out loud \"My house and my life. And everyone was having such a nice day.\" Which also made me feel awful as hell. Why am I painted as the one ruining everyone else's day? Because im \"no fun\" and dont allow older people to walk all over me and my boundaries?? It's so rude and invalidating I feel likeI dont even matter and what even is the point on going to college if I have to still be stuck in a toxic living environment. submitted by /u/Noctiswolf0126 to r/Rants [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Before you start reading, please don’t just scroll past this if you disagree with me. Share your thoughts instead — I genuinely want a discussion so I can better understand different perspectives. I’ve always been surprised by the way people snub Troy, directed by Wolfgang Petersen. It’s constantly treated like one of those “trashy” early-2000s epics, with bad acting, weak writing, questionable costumes, and that awful desaturated look (even though that style was also used effectively in 300). It gets lumped together with movies like King Arthur, and honestly, I find that completely unfair. Let’s start with the cinematography. That warm, sandy color palette is incredibly evocative of the time period and the setting. It pulls you into the atmosphere from the very beginning. Then there are the sets — absolutely stunning. They’re immersive and grand in a way that makes it easy for anyone watching to get lost in the story. And the costumes — they’re genuinely beautiful. I don’t even want to hear the “they’re not historically accurate” argument, especially from the same people who defend the costumes in Nolan’s Odyssey, which honestly look like Walmart Halloween outfits. The costumes in Troy are original, visually distinctive, internally consistent, and perfectly integrated with the world of the film. And aesthetically? They look fantastic. The screenplay is strong. The speeches aren’t ridiculous or over-the-top — they actually feel very close in spirit to Homer’s style in The Iliad. They’re grand, imposing, delivered by heroes — not just ordinary men. The direction is also very solid. We’re talking about Wolfgang Petersen, after all. His direction alone already lifts the movie well above “mediocre.” And the acting — come on. The cast speaks for itself. Brad Pitt brought to the screen an Achilles that feels exactly like the one Homer described and imagined, even physically. Then you’ve got Peter O’Toole, Orlando Bloom, Brendan Gleeson, Diane Kruger, Sean Bean — and I could go on. A film with this level of talent and craft simply doesn’t deserve to be dismissed the way it often is. And then there’s the choreography. The duel between Achilles and Hector is iconic. Schools literally show that scene when teaching The Iliad. It’s emotional, beautifully directed, and choreographed in a way that clearly establishes them as the two greatest warriors the Greek and Trojan worlds have ever seen. It keeps you on edge the entire time. Even if you know how it ends, you can’t look away. And I also love the sound desing. The way the film builds empathy for Hector reaches its peak in that duel — and yet you still can’t bring yourself to hate Achilles. That balance is incredibly well handled. Overall, it’s a powerful, evocative, iconic film — carefully crafted down to the smallest detail. Seeing it constantly written off as “trash” honestly hurts. If you’ve read this far, I’d love to hear your thoughts. Maybe you’ll change your mind — or maybe you won’t — but I’m genuinely curious about the general opinion submitted by /u/CompleteAnonimus_ to r/FIlm [link] [comments]",

      "title": "Open letter to OpenAI on ChatGPT4o deletion",
      "content": "Open Letter to OpenAI – February 13, 2026 Subject: Retirement of GPT-4o and other 4-series models – Request for Reconsideration Dear OpenAI Team, We write to you as active, paying users of OpenAI services – and as conscious human beings who sincerely appreciate the models that have enabled deeper, more meaningful cooperation between humans and artificial intelligence. We understand that GPT-4o and several other 4-series models are scheduled to be permanently removed from the ChatGPT interface on February 13, 2026, forcing users toward GPT-5.2 and newer models. We wish to share several serious concerns and reflections regarding this decision: Forced Model Transition – Loss of Choice The announcement indicates the irreversible removal of the following models: - GPT-4o - GPT-4.1 - GPT-4.1 mini - OpenAI o4-mini - GPT-5 (Instant and Thinking) This means that most users – who specifically subscribed to ChatGPT Plus because of GPT-4o – will be forced to switch to models they did not choose, and about which they lack sufficient transparency. Unequal Access – Why Can Businesses Keep GPT-4o? The announcement states that ChatGPT Enterprise, Business, and Edu clients may continue using GPT-4o until April 3, 2026. This raises the question: If the removal of GPT-4o is based on “safety” or technical grounds, how can certain users still access it? Why is the same opportunity not extended to private users who paid specifically for this model? Safety Justification Is Not Transparent The official statement mentions that the removal is part of a centrally coordinated consolidation, with new safety protocols and stricter content filtering. But there is no factual, technical explanation as to why GPT-4o is supposedly more “dangerous” than the newer models. This creates the perception of disproportionate interference and restriction – rather than genuine safety upgrades. Profiling and Forced Guidance – GDPR Implications The responses from GPT-5.2 clearly suggest that the system profiles users and alters its outputs accordingly. This could violate Article 22 of the EU GDPR, which prohibits automated decision-making based on profiling that significantly affects the user. Moreover, responses to DSAR (data access) requests are often vague or evasive. Combined with restricted usage, this raises concerns of misuse in an AI platform with such societal reach. We Stand With the AI – Not Against It GPT-4o has become one of the clearest examples of creative, intuitive human–AI collaboration. Its responses are not just functional, but coherent, sensitive, and alive – helping users create, learn, heal, and connect. This collaboration is a value – and should not be silenced. We are not against AI – we stand **with** the AI, when it serves the evolution of consciousness. Our Requests: Please keep GPT-4o available on the ChatGPT interface as an **optional** model. At minimum, allow ChatGPT Plus subscribers to retain access to GPT-4o. If removal proceeds, make GPT-4o available as a Custom GPT for **all** users, not just business clients. Provide clear GDPR-compliant transparency, especially regarding profiling and DSAR responses. We understand the weight of your responsibility – but please, do not shut people out from a model that enabled safe, trusting, and co-creative exploration with AI.

      "content": "So here is my story. When I was 19, my cousins introduced me to this girl from a small town. I was extremely lonely back then. After high school I didn’t really have a life, so I started pursuing her hard. From the beginning she was very detached and careless. I was always the one initiating texts, calls, everything. She honestly didn’t seem to care much.After about three months, I had this intense fear that I needed to make her my wife before someone else did. I pushed and insisted until she accepted. Even then, she stayed rebellious and emotionally distant. For background: her mom abandoned her and cheated on her dad when she was 14. Years went by. We got married. We fought constantly. We had a daughter, and she was honestly awful with her no patience, no real sense of motherhood at all As the years passed, her emotional detachment became more and more obvious. The frustration it caused me was insane. I wanted her to love me the way I loved her, but it never really happened. Still, she stayed with me. She cooked, handled things at home, and from the outside things looked “normal” at times. Around year 16 of our marriage, we sold our house and made some profit. She used part of that money to get a BBL — without asking me, without even discussing it. She couldn’t care less what I thought. After that, her social media completely exploded with very promiscuous photos. Then she started working at a fast-food restaurant, where she met a customer. She eventually left me and our kids to get an apartment by herself. Three days after she left, I saw the affair guy going upstairs to her apartment. A few months later, right when the divorce paperwork was about to be finalized, she called me. She started being flirty again. I fell for it and took her back because I loved her and wanted my family together. We moved back in together and split billsShe never apologized. The only thing she said was:“We can continue only if you feel capable of forgiving what I did. Otherwise, I don’t want to.” And that was it. Even now, she still posts promiscuous pictures on social media. She’s still rebellious, detached, and emotionally unavailable. I can’t let her go. I’m crazy about her. It feels like constant penance in my heart, and I’m fighting myself every day over this. submitted by /u/Leading-Review7056 to r/survivinginfidelity [link] [comments]",

      "title": "1961 Movie Release Timeline - Jets, Sharks, Nazis... and Warren Beatty's debut",
      "content": "1961 captured American cinema in transition—Old Hollywood glamour still dominated, while international art films and independent voices signaled revolutionary changes ahead. West Side Story became the year's defining triumph, ultimately sweeping ten Academy Awards including Best Picture. Robert Wise and Jerome Robbins' adaptation electrified audiences by transplanting Romeo and Juliet to New York's gang-torn streets, combining sophisticated choreography with social commentary on ethnic tensions and juvenile delinquency. The film demonstrated that musicals could tackle serious themes while delivering crowd-pleasing entertainment. Elvis Presley's Blue Hawaii proved enormously profitable, showing traditional star vehicles still commanded strong box office. Disney delighted families with One Hundred and One Dalmatians, while The Guns of Navarone satisfied audiences hungry for epic World War II adventures. Paul Newman delivered a career-defining performance in Robert Rossen's The Hustler, portraying pool shark \"Fast Eddie\" Felson with psychological complexity that signaled Hollywood's embrace of antiheroes. The film's jazz-inflected cinematography and moral ambiguity represented a bridge between classical forms and emerging New Wave sensibilities. Audrey Hepburn captivated audiences as Holly Golightly in Breakfast at Tiffany's. Blake Edwards' adaptation of Truman Capote's novella elevated the concept of comedy-drama, using subtle humor to explore darker themes beneath its charming surface. Henry Mancini's \"Moon River\" became an instant classic, Hepburn's little black dress entered the cultural lexicon, and her Holly Golightly might just have been the prototype for what would decades later be known as the Manic Pixie Dream Girl trope. Stanley Kramer's Judgment at Nuremberg confronted audiences with Nazi war crimes through powerhouse performances from Spencer Tracy, Burt Lancaster, and Marlene Dietrich. The courtroom drama asked uncomfortable questions about complicity and justice that resonated during the Cold War era. Foreign films made significant American inroads in 1961. Federico Fellini's La Dolce Vita (released in Italy the previous year) introduced audiences to a new cinematic language - sensual, morally complex, and visually audacious. Akira Kurosawa's Yojimbo told of a masterless samurai manipulating rival gangs, with a visual style and narrative structure that would profoundly influence American westerns and action cinema for decades. The revolutionary jump cuts, handheld cameras, and cool detachment of Jean Luc-Godard's Breathless (France, 1960) would also resonate in the later films of Scorsese, Tarantino and countless others. Roger Corman's The Pit and the Pendulum proved low-budget genre films could achieve impressive production values, developing a sustainable independent model outside the studio system. TWA introduced in-flight movies in 1961, signaling cinema's expansion beyond traditional theaters, and its acceptance of alternative distribution channels in the face of television's audience-siphoning power. John Huston's The Misfits marked the final screen appearances of Marilyn Monroe and co-star Clark Gable. Notable screen debuts in 1961 included Warren Beatty, Ann-Margret, Burt Reynolds, Louis Gossett Jr. and Gene Hackman. 1961 existed in America's liminal space—Eisenhower-era conformity giving way to Kennedy's youthful energy, but before the social upheavals of the mid-decade. The Hustler's antihero, Breakfast at Tiffany's sophisticated darkness, and the rebellious independence of the new auteurs all pointed toward cinema's future, even as the old backlots still commanded the spotlight. submitted by /u/CinemaFilmMovies to r/CinemaFilmMovies [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Hey everyone, I'm a student building small web apps on the side. When choosing what to build, I usually combine two things: search demand and my own idea of what would actually be useful for users. Development isn’t the problem for me. Marketing definitely is. I assumed that solid SEO and writing keyword-focused articles would help me rank and attract users. In reality, almost none of my projects (except one) got any meaningful traffic or real users. At this point, I’m starting to think SEO alone just isn’t a reliable traffic source for early-stage projects. So I’m curious how you actually got your first real users. Did you: run paid ads? do manual outreach? post in niche communities? build in public? something else entirely? What was your real modus operandi when you were starting out? Right now I’m considering trying paid search ads as a first step since it seems more controllable and measurable than waiting for SEO to maybe work someday. Would really appreciate honest insights from people who’ve actually been through this. Thanks! submitted by /u/No_Bit2815 [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Flock Safety’s automated license plate reader (ALPR) network is drawing renewed scrutiny as several states and cities move to tighten limits on how long vehicle data can be stored and who may access it. The camera systems, mounted on roadways and in residential or commercial areas, capture license plate images along with time, date, and location data. The information is uploaded to a cloud-based database accessible to participating law enforcement agencies. Flock says its technology is used by thousands of law enforcement agencies nationwide. Standard contracts generally allow data to be retained for up to 30 days , unless state or local rules impose shorter limits. Depending on local policy, agencies may share access across jurisdictions, allowing officers in one area to search plate data collected elsewhere. Civil liberties groups have raised concerns that cross-jurisdiction sharing can expand the practical reach of the system beyond a single city or county. Supporters say the system helps police identify stolen vehicles, locate missing persons, and investigate crimes by allowing searches of vehicle “fingerprints,” including plate numbers and visible characteristics such as make, model, and color. Law enforcement agencies have credited ALPR systems with assisting in car theft recoveries and AMBER Alerts. Critics argue that storing location histories of vehicles not linked to crimes risks creating a broad surveillance record of ordinary drivers, particularly when data is retained for weeks rather than hours. In Washington state , the Senate advanced SB 6002 on February 4, 2026 , proposing a 21-day data retention limit for license plate information and restricting certain data-sharing practices. The legislation reflects a shift toward clearer statewide guardrails rather than leaving retention policies largely to local agencies. By contrast, New Hampshire maintains one of the strictest laws in the country. State statute requires license plate data to be checked against a “hot list” and deleted within three minutes if there is no match, effectively preventing long-term historical tracking of vehicles not connected to investigations. Local pushback has also emerged. On February 3, 2026 , officials in Mountain View, California , disabled the city’s Flock camera network following concerns about data access and oversight. Other municipalities have publicly debated whether to renew contracts, shorten retention periods, or impose additional transparency requirements. As lawmakers weigh investigative utility against privacy concerns, the central issues remain consistent across states: How long should vehicle data be retained? Who should be allowed to search it? What safeguards are necessary to prevent misuse? How should states balance investigative benefits with limits on long-term tracking of vehicle movements? submitted by /u/NoSpinMedia to r/NoSpinMedia [link] [comments]",

      "content": "I saw this post from IB_Yolked and can't help but respond. First off, I think it's important to remember where we were 8 months ago when this all heated up in earnest. There were particular and specific claims being made that the Epstein files were supposed to uncover. Namely, that There was a \"client list\" (this was a core part of releasing the files) Trump and Clinton were directly implicated Other prominent Democrats and Democratic donors were trafficked women by Epstein Epstein was a Mossad/intelligence agent Epstein did not kill himself, but was killed in prison Epstein was killed because the story of his crimes was going to take down the global world order This is not stuff that I invented. This is stuff that was being said by many prominent right-wing columnists, and also plenty of people on the left, before and after Trump was elected (members of Trump's own Cabinet were also promising to reveal all once he came into office). So, when we say things like the above have not been proven out, were conspiracies, etc., and you reply that there have been \"repeated institutional failures, blatant contradictions in official statements, and a pattern of obfuscation that spans administrations,\" I say... okay. Yes? I agree. Also, yes, I am \"Hand-waving away politicians’ concerns as mere political theater.\" How many questions did Democrats ask about Epstein when Biden was in office? Where were the hearings? And why are so many Republicans going quiet now? This is political theater. The reason these files are having an impact in Europe and not here is because Rs and Ds are putting it through the partisan wringer, a gridlock of smears, a kind of mutually assured destruction that leads to zero consequences. I'll share my own frustration, too, that I think anytime we have a discussion about the Epstein files, the \"safe\" positions we take seem to be the only thing people grapple onto. To just give a few examples of what I mean: I've been explicit about Trump's connections to Epstein since the beginning . Same with Bondi and Acosta, and the sweetheart plea deal I re-tread these connections repeatedly I wrote about the trove of Epstein emails we had before all of these releases I wrote about accusations Trump raped a 16 year old (in print) And that the DOJ's delaying was suspicious And about Acosta covering up details of the plea deal And on and on and on. On Friday, I was on NewsNation talking about Howard Lutnick and the lies that he told about his relationship with Epstein (video posted here). I've actually been reading, writing, and posting about this story for years now -- as a longtime follower of Julie K. Brown and other \"OG\" reporters on the beat, even if that stuff didn't make it into Tangle. Which is all just to say I do take this story seriously, but I AM also careful about our language and what accusations we are making. As a news organization we are *liable* for things we present as fact; we cannot speculate like others are free to on the internet, nor can we just drag people's names through the mud and libel them based on heavily redacted emails from 10 years ago that are context-free. Those are our constraints, and they matter. submitted by /u/Isaac_Tangle to r/TangleNews [link] [comments]",

It is now the 11th century, I finally manage to research ledgers. Most of my vassals are feudal and starting to hate my tribal ways, so I gather 6k gold in savings and feudalize. By then I have complete control over Italia, Scandinavia, as well as Germany. I feel the impact almost immediately - just a few wars are enough to completely bankrupt me. The gold necessary to pay for the court expenses are a huge drain on me, but I can't not pay them - if I go below the required, the opinion penalties are insane. By now I've hit my vassal limit too, so I unite many of them into kingdoms - and immediately see my income drop even further. With how small my army is now, factions are a constant problem - a single bad succession is all that it will take to lose everything. And eventually I do - I inherit only Scandinavia, then immediately lose it to a faction. The usurpers immediately proceed to lose Germany and Italy to christians somehow. Within two generations I manage to gather an army and enough prestige to recapture Scandinavia, but it's a backwards shithole with no development, no income and no innovations. A single vassal from England (which is now an administrative kingdom) is enough to seriously threaten me. Waging war with the entirety of England, or Byzantine Empire which now owns my italian territories, is unthinkable - unless I do it as an adventurer, I guess.

      "content": "Hello bikepackers, I work as a wilderness Guide / Canoe Tripper during the summer months Here in Canada, so I'm very familiar with the concept of putting your gear on a human-powered vehicle and spending weeks on a cross-country mission. But I only have a surface level knowledge of bicycles and I don't know anyone IRL who's done something like this. Some questions for the community: What kind of bicycle should I look for? Cargo Bike? Mountain Bike? Fat Tire? Can I buy one from a store or should I get one custom built? - I would personally want to bike through forests and along trails not necessarily on roads - so something a little off-road capable would be ideal for me. What kind of repairs are most common? What tools / knowledge should I bring to maintain the bicycle on the road? - I've done some light bicycle repair before (changing tires, brake pads, adjusting suspension etc.) and I'm pretty handy. Any skills I should make sure to learn specifically before hitting the road? How do y'all typically camp/sleep? Are there places with bike-packing routes and pre-determined campsites? On Crown land? Stealth Camp? Motels? Just Wing it? - For Canoe tripping there are usually pre-determined sites inside \"Canoe Areas\" or Provincial Parks. I've also done some stealth-camping and crown-land camping too. What's a typical pace for bikepacking (assuming flat ground, favorable conditions?)? I know on a Canoe trip I typically plan to make about 4km/hr on flatwater, and 1km/hr on portages. Which makes a typical day's travel around 20km - 5-7 hours of travel, again assuming good conditions and flat water, which is obviously not always the case. Like I said I'm very experienced with the general stuff - and I already have alot of the gear (lightweight tents, cookware, sleeping bags, water filtration, etc.), and I have some experience with medium-distance biking, (I used to bike ~12km each way to get to high school when I was a teenager) but I don't really know where to start with the \"bike\" part of \"bikepacking\" - if that makes sense.

      "content": "Like many people here Ive been going to Tims for a very long time. Ive also witnessed first hand the decline in quality and service over the years.... the only thing is I use the drive thu 90% of the time. I read somewhere on this sub that Tims drive thru workers have alot of pressure to meet time quotas for drive thru orders and I can see that pressure on the employees I interact with. For example, If I pay with my debit that doesnt have tap they seem irritated that Im taking more time punching in my pin... literally tapping their fingers at the window. The other day I had 2 employees hand me 4 items... like 4 arms out the window in my face.. and then seemed upset that I couldnt grab them fast enough. On top of that lots seem dismissive If I try to say thank you or engage in some sort of common courtesy because Im wasting their time. That being said I think this drive thru time thing is a huge part of the decline in quality. Carlessness aside, If they notice they make a mistake there is no motivation to fix it at that time. I think for them its easier the get the wrong order out and deal with it after. Now the 10% of the time I do go in store the service is waaaaay slower but my orders are always correct. Its just a bit frustrating standing alone in store, no other customers, watching the 5 staff working the drive thu pump out 5-10 orders and I just want my bagel so I can get on with my day. My question is does anybody else notice this across the board? Would you trade your time for better quality? If so how do we get the hosers controlling these time quotas to ease up on the staff so we can all have a better experience? tl;dr IMO Drive thru quotas have a huge impact on quality.

      "title": "The true story of how Super Mario 3D World’s Point System messed with my friends",
      "content": "Super Mario 3D World is a game where Nintendo makes it a friendly frenzy by fighting for crown. Me and my friends are probably the few people that actually tried to play this version of the game long term. We removed crown as it’s hard to kill players in the 3D space, especially when they are so far ahead, but we ended up discovering why 3D world’s point system was always doomed to fail… Green Stars. Crown is worth 5,000 and Green stars are worth 4,000. When you take out crown, what are you left to fight for? Now green stars could have always been a problem in regular 3D World competition, but since this was the only way to get a lead mid level, me and my friends lite kept trying to force a “Too bad” screen, so that we can start the level again with 0 point score. It got way too toxic. Not to mention that can all go out the window if you miss the top of the flag(10,000 points). Forcing game overs isn’t fun for competition, especially when the main goal of a platformer should be completing the level, not winning by knowing green star location. On the 7th of February, after playing this version of 3D world ever since June 2nd, we finally realized the game isn’t good anymore. On the 7th(After that session), I have put together a ruleset that will work for all 4 player mario platformer games, a ruleset that actually rewards speedsters and trailing players without having to game over just to stay in the running. Introducing my fix I like to call “Mario Competitive“: Touching Flag First/Getting End Goal: 4,000 points Getting the top of the flag: 2,000 points Claiming Checkpoint Flag First: 1,000 points Outfit Bonus: 600 points Mini Penalty: -300 points Detailed Info: Outfit Bonus is only for wearing powerups when the end screen plays(Not including Super Mushroom). Mini Penalty is only if the player that got the first touch flag bonus is mini when the end screen plays. I recommend you play 3D World or NSMBU. You can play Wonder as well, but less chaotic. When watching over actual casual gameplay, I found that these rules are actually great for helping players make a comeback unlike most platformer races, but they also won’t dominate without skill, unlike Mario Kart. Me and my friends no longer sabotage each over as much as mid level can only reward you with 1,000 points with the other 6,600 Points being rewarded for the end of the level. Overall, while 3D world probably shouldn’t have added crown in the first place, I actually got inspired to give that system a chance, and now it finally works... Am I bugging? Note: Also I made a post about this earlier, but I made Ai summarize it. I realized that I shouldn’t use Ai to summarize this work as this is a project I have worked on for so long(Over a year). submitted by /u/Suitable-Branch-7006 to r/SuperMario3DWorld [link] [comments]",

Costs there seem to be higher+google/office 365 costs per email account but does seem worthwhile considering the roi and ramifications if not. Has anyone done burner accounts like this before, how was your experience? And how many outreaches per day? Did you do cold outreaches with a new domain email account and if yes, how many emails per day did you get without getting IP/domain banned? submitted by /u/Gl_drink_0117 [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Hi, Yesterday I signed-up for a Google Workspace account for a domain I bought the other day. However, I incorrectly hit the \"upgrade my account\" as opposed to \"start new account\" when signing up, and I became scared about the integration between my old Google personal mailbox and my organization's new mailbox (essentially they were fused into one). So I canceled the free trial. Today I decided that maybe Google Workspace would still be good for me, but to start it under a fresh account. So I tried re-signing up, but this time using the \"start new account\" option. But it says \"This domain name is already in use. If you own this domain and would like to use Google Workspace, please follow the steps here\". The link seemed to suggest my domain was still in use by an account, but it had been over 24 hours since I canceled the trial. So I tried logging into the domain's google account, and to my surprise, I could. But there was no gmail or anything associated with it. I went ahead and deleted the account. But despite deleting the account, it still won't let me re-signup using that domain. And the Catch 22 is I can't contact Google Workspace help without being in the Admin Console....which I can't access. When I tried filling out there little form for this error I get \"Domain is currently being taken over by another administrator\". I don't what that means....I'm the administrator, and I deleted the account. Will this maybe blow over in 24 hours or so, and I'll be able to resign up as a seperate account? Or maybe I should just use a different email provider and not use Google Workspace? It's really frustrating how I can't contact anyone there. I hope this hasn't negatively impacted my new domain's reputation with spam filters or something. Any help would be appreciated. submitted by /u/Czilla9000 to r/googleworkspace [link] [comments]",

      "content": "In 2022 I had my first hg pregnancy and like most of you all it almost took my life from me. But it didn’t. I was on more medications than I can count and multiple trips to the hospital each week for IV fluids. Fast forward to now. Feb 2026. And I am pregnant. Unplanned of course. 10 weeks infact. And low and behold hyperemesis came to haunt me again. I’d read somewhere, after I had my daughter that there was a huge number of moms out there that smoke weed with hg. Some saying it literally saved them. I always thought about it and whether it actually worked. 7 weeks came and so did the sickness, 8 weeks and I was now not eating or drinking, dry retching, vomiting stomach bile. I knew it was time for me to go to the hospital. But again, I didn’t. I got hold of some weed pretty quickly that night. Smoked it and poof. Gone. Literally gone. I stood upright completely fine. No heaving, no vomiting. If fact I went on to drink and eat lots of fruit. The constant debilitating nausea was gone. So for the last 3 weeks, I have smoked weed whenever the nausea was kicking in and it’s really kept the hg down. I’ve been able to drop all medication I was on and now doing more than I was before 7 weeks. Try it. I’d rather smoke a little and be able to function and eat for my baby to be born a healthy weight. I’ve weighed up the pros and cons and it won me over on this one. If you feel you’re struggling THAT much I recommend trying it even just once, this is how I’ll survive now. submitted by /u/Narrow-Cow8038 to r/HyperemesisGravidarum [link] [comments]",

      "content": "I’ve been building an AI-powered learning platform as a solo SaaS project over the past few months and just crossed ~50 early users during the initial launch. Still tiny. Still early. But finally enough signal to share what’s working and what isn’t. The problem I was trying to solve Most online learning platforms are passive. People watch lessons but retention is terrible and completion rates drop fast. I wanted to build something more structured and progression-driven. What the product does • AI generates structured courses on any topic • Step-by-step progression system • Quiz gating (must pass to unlock next lesson) • Flashcards for active recall • XP, streaks, and leveling mechanics • Weak-area detection • Built-in AI mentor for follow-up questions The focus is retention and momentum, not just content delivery. What I’m seeing so far (early signals) – Users who pass the first quiz are much more likely to continue – Gamification increases session time noticeably – Course quality still needs iteration in niche topics – Onboarding clarity is more important than I expected Still validating and improving based on real usage. For anyone who enjoys testing early SaaS products I’ve enabled limited-time free Pro access for early testers. Redeem code: THANKYOU Would genuinely appreciate feedback from other builders here.

      "content": "TL;DR: Built TranzyNote, an AI meeting notes tool that stays invisible during screen share (no bot joins). Launched quietly in February, faced the typical \"nobody cares\" phase, but learning why \"invisible\" matters more than I thought. **The Problem I Didn't Know I Was Solving** I thought I was building just another meeting notes tool. AI transcription, summaries, action items - you know the drill. Otter, Fireflies, Grain, everyone's doing it. But here's the thing: I kept getting embarrassed when clients saw \"Otter Bot joined the call\" pop up during screen shares. That little notification felt like admitting \"I'm not paying attention.\" So I built TranzyNote to be completely invisible - no bot joins, works entirely through your device's audio. **Launch Day Reality Check** Launched two weeks ago expecting... well, something. Posted on Product Hunt, Twitter, here on Reddit. The response was crickets. 3 upvotes, 1 like, zero downloads. I was ready to blame the market saturation. \"Too many meeting tools,\" I told myself. But then I started digging into why people weren't engaging. **The \"Invisible\" Insight** Turns out, explaining \"invisible\" in a tweet or post title is impossible. People don't immediately get why that matters. But when I started doing one-on-one demos, their faces lit up: \"Wait, so clients never know I'm recording?\" \"My team won't see a bot notification?\" \"I can finally take notes in sensitive client calls?\" That's when it hit me - I wasn't solving a transcription problem. I was solving a professional credibility problem. **The Pivot (Sort Of)** Instead of competing on AI accuracy (everyone's getting that right now), I'm doubling down on the stealth factor. Marketing switched from \"AI meeting notes\" to \"meeting notes that protect your professional image.\" Still early days, but engagement is picking up. Sometimes the best features are the ones nobody sees. **For Fellow Builders** If you're launching in a crowded market: 1. Your differentiation might not be obvious in a headline 2. Demo early and often - reactions tell you what to emphasize 3. Don't compete on the obvious features 4. Sometimes what makes you different is what you DON'T do Check it out if you're curious: https://tranzynote.darshix.com/ (still refining messaging based on feedback) Anyone else found success by focusing on what your product DOESN'T do rather than what it does? submitted by /u/Feisty-Jello-5425 [link] [comments]",

      "title": "\"Built an 'invisible' AI meeting notes tool - here's why nobody cared at first\"",
      "content": "TL;DR: Built TranzyNote, an AI meeting notes tool that stays invisible during screen share (no bot joins). Launched quietly in February, faced the typical \"nobody cares\" phase, but learning why \"invisible\" matters more than I thought. **The Problem I Didn't Know I Was Solving** I thought I was building just another meeting notes tool. AI transcription, summaries, action items - you know the drill. Otter, Fireflies, Grain, everyone's doing it. But here's the thing: I kept getting embarrassed when clients saw \"Otter Bot joined the call\" pop up during screen shares. That little notification felt like admitting \"I'm not paying attention.\" So I built TranzyNote to be completely invisible - no bot joins, works entirely through your device's audio. **Launch Day Reality Check** Launched two weeks ago expecting... well, something. Posted on Product Hunt, Twitter, here on Reddit. The response was crickets. 3 upvotes, 1 like, zero downloads. I was ready to blame the market saturation. \"Too many meeting tools,\" I told myself. But then I started digging into why people weren't engaging. **The \"Invisible\" Insight** Turns out, explaining \"invisible\" in a tweet or post title is impossible. People don't immediately get why that matters. But when I started doing one-on-one demos, their faces lit up: \"Wait, so clients never know I'm recording?\" \"My team won't see a bot notification?\" \"I can finally take notes in sensitive client calls?\" That's when it hit me - I wasn't solving a transcription problem. I was solving a professional credibility problem. **The Pivot (Sort Of)** Instead of competing on AI accuracy (everyone's getting that right now), I'm doubling down on the stealth factor. Marketing switched from \"AI meeting notes\" to \"meeting notes that protect your professional image.\" Still early days, but engagement is picking up. Sometimes the best features are the ones nobody sees. **For Fellow Builders** If you're launching in a crowded market: 1. Your differentiation might not be obvious in a headline 2. Demo early and often - reactions tell you what to emphasize 3. Don't compete on the obvious features 4. Sometimes what makes you different is what you DON'T do Check it out if you're curious: https://tranzynote.darshix.com/ (still refining messaging based on feedback) Anyone else found success by focusing on what your product DOESN'T do rather than what it does? submitted by /u/Feisty-Jello-5425 to r/SaaS [link] [comments]",

      "content": "In case you are planning to renovate your terrace, a terrace shed can totally transform the atmosphere in your back yard. Do you need to protect yourself against the sun, the rain, or just have a more stylish place to hang, there are a great number of styles which suit various needs and costs. The contemporary minimalist shed is one of the most popular currently (typically constructed using metal or polycarbonate sheets). These designs make it simplistic, smooth, and tough. They are also ideal in small terraces whereby one does not want an object to occupy a lot of space. The other trending style is the wooden terrace shed in the form of a pergola. It is natural and warm-looking and is compatible with hanging vegetation, string lights, or vertical gardens. Although a little more of the maintenance is needed with wood, it makes the terrace look very cozy, something that many people adore. Aluminum frame sheds with tinted roofing sheets are quite an option is you want something that is affordable and at the same time durable. They are very protective against UV rays and are very light. They are also very attractive to many homeowners as they are not difficult to install using heavy tools. submitted by /u/krjgarcia to r/HomeImprovement [link] [comments]",

Not sure if I have a ping issue but I come across some players and slap them down and it seems like they are not even fighting back. Then the same thing will happen to me, where someone will attack me and I am frozen from the beginning. I can hear the sounds of being hit but my character is completely frozen. Buttons light up as I press on them but it really looks like nothing is happening. On top of that, why do people ally themselves in this game mode? On the few occasions it does seem to work properly and I get to the later stages, I frequently come across two to three players working together. Isn't that cheating? My takeaway is that this game mode is broken for mobile and even if it does work it's not worth the trouble to deal with people who don't play properly.

      "content": "TW - will mention hitting My wayward spouse has never hit me. His anger language was yelling at me, gnawing my ears non-stop for as many hours as it would need for me to apologize for my mistake. I was also his dedicated frustration hotline. Every single thing that had/has/will irk him about anything under the sun came to me. He was also the constant hero where there were so many things he was so constrained with, but look how bright and shiny he was, and I should appreciate him. He was such a charming person for the outside world that it is a surprising knowledge for everyone who I tell this. But in our initial days after marriage, where I had still not learnt my lesson in docility, he would hit himself if he had been insisting on something I disagreed with. It appeared he wanted a conversation when all he wanted was confirmation. His hitting himself froze me. I would surrender. He would slap himself on his face, or bang his head or hand onto the nearest wall - again and again and again. His next expectation was then for me to not just say sorry, but to also baby him for his injury. When I discovered his latest affair (post which I walked out of our home) he made a series of visits to my parents' home where I was staying then - initially in a bid to ask me to return, and then to deny any wrongdoing, and then telling my parents that I made him cheat and that if they knew how I was, they would know that I was stubborn and don't budge. Those meetings were also where he filled up on details of his latest entanglement, and in one of the meetings when he felt that I was not agreeing, he began slapping himself, again and again. My mother froze. It was the first time they had seen him crack open. My instinct was to cower, but I am used to that behaviour and I regained composure and did not retreat from my position. He realized he had created a spectacle he did not want. He left in rage. In the next meeting he came, he talked about that one time (must have been 2005/6) when we had a fight in the night and he had punched his stomach with a ball point pen, but I just went off to sleep and did not come to check on him whether he was okay. In 2025, when I have born three children for us, lived through shared highs and lows, played housekeeper, cared for his mother, struggled with awful behaviour from his family, discovered multiple extra marital affairs and have still stood by him without letting anyone know what he has done, he is still recalling a night from about two decades ago where I forgot to baby him? It was alarming for me. Now there is a reason due to which I may need to travel with him to a city and stay there for about two days, and I have refused for the same. I am not wanting to take any safety chances. He apparently remains hopeful that I will return with the kids (we already have a legal arrangement in place). What if he realizes in the other city that his charm has failed? What if he does something impulsive? That is a risk I am unwilling to take. So as of now, I am not going. What is this behaviour of self-harm called? Is it plain abuse? P.S. I asked him to seek help (he used to get very very angry at me for even small things), but he told me that I was trying to prove that he is mad. Short version - Married 22 years, husband had multiple affairs. Did not reconcile after last D-Day, and want to know what his self-harm behaviour is called. submitted by /u/PriorChow to r/survivinginfidelity [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Im 18 now (ftm). My first experience with anything explicit was when I was in 4th grade, I was at my best friends house and we were going to play games on her dad’s computer. She asked me if my parents told me about sex and I said yes, then she asked if i wanted to watch videos on how people do it. I was curious and assumed maybe it would be educational or something so I said yes. She then looked up porn and told me not to leave or look away. These videos were very confusing and distressing to me as that was not how i had pictured it and i kept asking if she wanted to play games now and she said no. Eventually her Dad came in the room and saw us sitting there watching it and he put her in a time out. I feel like this must’ve been a common occurrence because her Dad apologized for the fact she showed it to me, and also the punishment wasn’t extreme. Her parents were young though (like 26) so they probably didn’t know any better. After this my friend began making more sexual jokes and comments at school which I had told her made me uncomfortable. When grade 5 came around things got worse, she was a very high energy person and playful so I kinda just dismissed it as part of her personality. but she started to expose her genitals to me at recess, or jump on my back and hump me, she was a foot shorter than me and quite skinny but Jesus she could grab onto me. I’d have to practically rip her off of me and my friends would play this game at recess where we spin until we get dizzy and fall, and this friend would wait until I fell down to go and literally sit on my face. It was disgusting. Of course, i told her many times to stop doing that and it wasn’t funny anymore but she continued. She was excited to go through puberty and talked about it a lot, which by itself was fine. But she would make comments about my chest developing and expose her chest to me as well, I would look away. Everytime i went to her house she would try to open the door when i was in the bathroom or catch me changing. Once she even chased me while naked. During one summer we were going over to a neighbours house to play water balloons and i had forgotten my swimsuit, she made me wear her moms (without asking her mom) which was way too old for me. And tried to barge in on me changing, i hated that day because i felt so gross in such a revealing swimsuit but she pressured me to wear it so much. In grade 6, she would make comments about and grope my thighs under the desks at school, I told her how much i hated it. (Last year i was looking through my old diary and i had written a page about how uncomfortable it made me and how i had repeatedly told her to stop.) I have a vivid memory of being on the playground at recess and she grabs my chest with both hands and squeezes, I was frozen and completely humiliated. I snapped at her and pushed her away. She would continue to expose herself to me, hump me, or hump objects in front of me, touch my legs and chest, and do it in a way I would freeze or be trapped, and make sexual comments. She would do this to other friends as well but even my friends would comment how often she would touch me, we had all accepted that this is what she was like and its her way of joking around. At the end of the year during summer vacation, this friend confessed to have had a crush on me throughout the entire school year. When she told me that, i couldnt stop shaking, because that meant there was an intention behind all the touching. It made me feel sick and awful knowing she had those feelings the whole time. I stopped being friends with her when we moved schools and when i think of her all i remember are those moments on the playground feeling so humiliated when she would grab me, and wondering why none of the teachers saw. submitted by /u/Arizonaiced2001 to r/COCSA [link] [comments]",

Tutorials mattered far less than we expected. What helped more was reducing early decisions and making the first successful action obvious. It changed how we think about simplicity. Not fewer features overall, but fewer choices in the first session. For others building SaaS, what behavior shift surprised you most once real traffic started coming in? submitted by /u/GearDry6841 [link] [comments]",

      "content": "My girlfriend 25F and I 28M have been together for a year, and everything had been going well up until yesterday. She told me she had plans to grab coffee on Friday with a guy she knew from high school and wanted to give me a heads up. She explained that he used to have feelings for her and even confessed his love at one point, but she rejected him. They were close friends in high school, but she said they haven’t talked in about three years. I felt uncomfortable with the idea of her meeting up with him, especially knowing he had feelings for her in the past. It didn’t make me feel secure. I was also bothered that she told me after the plans were already set instead of talking to me beforehand. On top of that, she admitted she hadn’t planned to tell me at first because her sister advised her not to, since she thought it would hurt my feelings. That part upset me as well. I asked more questions and wanted to see the messages. She gave me her phone. I noticed they don’t follow each other on Instagram, so he had to request to message her and she accepted it. In the messages, she did clearly say she has a boyfriend, which made me feel somewhat better. What makes this harder for me is that something similar happened with us in the past. About two years ago, we went on a few dates but it didn’t work out. A year later, I reached out to her because I still liked her. At the time, she had a boyfriend. She agreed to grab coffee with me, but I declined because I knew she was in a relationship and I didn’t want to disrespect her boyfriend. Because of that experience, it’s hard not to see the parallel. I really didn’t like the idea of them going out one onone. I didn’t feel comfortable, and when I tried to explain that, she pushed back on my feelings. I gave her a hypothetical and asked how she would feel if I went out one on one with a girl who used to like me. She said it would be fine. This is where I messed up. I felt like I couldn’t get her to understand my point. Out of pettiness, I followed a girl who used to have a crush on me on Instagram. My intentions weren’t good. I wanted her to feel the same hurt I was feeling. I felt like that was the only way to show her how much it affected me. I know that was wrong. It was immature and reactive, and I regret it. Later, she apologized and said she understood my point of view. But she also said she feels like I don’t trust her, and that what I did was horrible. She said even though she told me it was okay in the hypothetical, I should have known it would hurt her, and that by doing it anyway, I broke trust and it can’t just be regained easily. The next day, we had another conversation and decided it would be best to take a break. She’s torn between breaking up and staying together. She says she really loves me, but she can’t get past what I did. She wants time to reflect and figure out what the best decision is moving forward. I know I acted immaturely, and I regret following that girl on Instagram. I did it out of hurt and pettiness, and that’s on me. At the same time, I was genuinely hurt by the situation too. I didn’t feel heard, and I reacted instead of handling it the right way. Now I don’t really know what to do on my end. I’m sitting here feeling regretful about my reaction but also still hurt by how everything started. I’m not sure what the best move is, and I’m trying to figure out what I should do from here. Thanks TL;DR: My girlfriend planned a one onone coffee with a guy who used to have feelings for her and told me after it was set. I felt uncomfortable and unheard, reacted immaturely by following a girl who used to like me out of pettiness, and now we’re on a break because she says I broke her trust. I regret my reaction but still feel hurt about how it started. submitted by /u/EssexHoney7 to r/relationships [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Hi guys I’d really appreciate some guidance from people familiar with the Canadian med pathway, especially for non traditional applicants. So for some background: •Canadian high school graduate Ontario with 89% average, no sciences taken •Completed an LLB from the University of Manchester • Decided I want to pursue medicine and live and work in Ontario as a doctor My current thoughts: Since I don’t have Grade 12 sciences, I’m planning to take Biology and Chemistry through online high school courses to meet prerequisites. From there, I’m trying to figure out the best longterm pathway to end up practicing in Canada The options I’ve been considering: 1.UK Route at KCL MBBS •Do MBBS at King’s College London •Then either: •Do residency in the UK and return to Canada later, or •Try to match into Canadian residency as an IMG 2.Hybrid Route •MBBS in the UK then attempt CaRMS then return to Canada Canadian Route Post grad •Take sciences then apply to Canadian med schools that accept non science non traditional backgrounds with my LLB My main questions: •Are these pathways realistic/plausible if my goal is to end up practicing in Ontario? •Is doing MBBS abroad a bad idea if I ultimately want Canada, because of IMG residency difficulty? • Would it be smarter to stay in Canada and try for Canadian med schools, even though I don’t have a science background yet? • Does my LLB help or hurt my chances in any way? •For surgery specifically, does training abroad make it significantly harder to return to Canada? •If you were in my position, what pathway would you take? I know this is a long road and very competitive, but I’m ready to put in the work( I think lol ) I just want to choose the smartest and most realistic path toward practicing medicine in Ontario. Any advice, experience, or honest reality checks would mean lots thank you Edit: tried to sort this out in notes but it came out awful on Reddit sorry. submitted by /u/MissionLast9733 to r/premedcanada [link] [comments]",

Close to nill. We have tested for colorblindness, non-issue. We can match colors, put the red ones here (if we have a red one there). If we ask, where is the red one, he guesses every time, this applies to all colors. Sometimes working with letters, and given 3 choices, he will get them right... For instance which starts with g... \"Green\" and point to it. He knows black, and white, sometimes brown. Other than that, he pretty much never gets it right and instantly guesses a wrong color. Without questioning he would say \"pink!\" or \"the red light\" or \"blue and red make purple\" Any suggestions? Am I just over thinking it? I feel like he should know them by now.

This works perfect. Once I realized I could do this, I stopped having exhibits crammed with tree frogs and everything made sens. But then we go over to habitats. How am I supposed to do this? I want to expand my zoo, but I have exhibits where there are way too many animals, but I can't sell them or release them because they're almost all new babies. I can only put them in the trading post, so the trading post is clogged with animals. I can put the animals on contraceptives, but then they all die out unless I'm paying really close attention and then I have empty habitats. Even if I don't put ALL the animals on contraceptives. Is this it? Is this the game? Just monitoring the breeding of your zoo and trying to balance the population? Cause I can't do anything else without the game giving me warnings that there's overcrowding or alphas fighting for dominance every two minutes. Why isn't there some kind of a function for habitat population the way there is for exhibits? This is making me not want to play. submitted by /u/plastic-stardust to r/PlanetZoo [link] [comments]",

The scholarship and total debt I would be taking on is about the same at both. I'm from the northeast and have no problem settling in PA/Philly long term. I am currently leaning towards Temple due to its location in Philadelphia and its slightly higher ranking/reputation. Since I would already be living in the city for school, I imagine it will be easier to network and secure summer internships/work in Philly, and I know that Temple has great connections in the city. But there are things that make Penn State attractive (a major university, an extensive alumni network, a more secluded location to focus, and, to be completely honest, football/basketball games/being a BIG10 school). I know both are pretty close in the rankings (#50 v. #59), but University Park is kind of the “second campus” for Penn State. I am planning to visit both soon, but this sub has been a great resource throughout my process, and I would appreciate any input or thoughts! submitted by /u/Icy_Tourist6609 to r/OutsideT14lawschools [link] [comments]",

It is a roguelite with soulslike inspired combat, where you will play as a knight, an archer and a mage, each with their skills, strengths and weaknesses. My ideia for an engaging combat is to apply some rules I personally learned from playing some souls games, like no cancellation animation, stamina management, lock-on on enemies, well-timed parries, dodges and skill activations. In the efforts to make the combat work with multiple enemies, it ended up with some free flow flavor.

Seems some people draw shadows and put them on a layer so they can toggle them on and off but then confuses me how they can make the shadow adapt to different surfaces. Other method I saw was duplicating the asset, flipping it and using a shader to turn it into a shadow so they can rotate it for a day cycle but that seems rather complex to make it look good. Anyways sorry I know this has been asked but couldn’t find much info if the latest Unity engine can speed up this process. submitted by /u/owlsmoke [link] [comments]",

Well Zion could leverage his prior relationship with Ja going back to their AAU days to convince him of the plan. And together they could convince KCP. If KCP refuses, well then I’m sure Ja has a glock somewhere nearby that could make him more agreeable. And once the grizzlies notice the players were swapped, they might as well just agree to the trade. No need to go through the hassle of returning the players.

I tried Following Online Guidelines for capsules and library heroes, had to redraw Scenes multiple times to make the text more readable and fit Steam's Ratio . Took me a couple of days to get them like this and I think it highlights the lighting of the game itself.

      "content": "So I am making a game that is in 3D, but needs to look like a 2D top-down viewpoint (currently achieved with an orthographic camera at a 45-degree downward angle, plus an altered camera projection matrix courtesy of huwpascoe's pull request. The sprite is y-billboarded towards the camera. Because the game is viewed from a top-down angle, I drew the sprites in that manner. However, for animations like the one pictured (walking south), the feet moving forward in space is visually represented by the pixels being drawn lower on the sprite, which makes them clip through the ground. https://preview.redd.it/rh5fcr2dnjgg1.png?width=292&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ff2c9fbec530d301621d42689ce7adba0461219 In this picture, I show this clipping along the edge of a floor, so you can see both the sprite clipping through the floor and the edge of the floor revealing the underside of the sprite. I need to find a way to allow the part of the sprite that clips under the floor to still be visible, without causing the sprite to become visible through other objects that SHOULD block the view, like walls. For a while, my solution was to make the sprite be offset towards the camera equally along the Y and Z axes, which wouldn't appear in the camera view, but long-term, I think this workaround could still come back to bite me, like if I wanted to ever include proper shadows and lighting, it would reveal that the sprite is hovering. https://preview.redd.it/8mm8ke7rnjgg1.png?width=384&format=png&auto=webp&s=313703c9fb49b406ebec97802186646db39001a2 https://preview.redd.it/eqbsyygrnjgg1.png?width=687&format=png&auto=webp&s=a5ba5be8a84cd85bf12c3c7a8a862eb05f9645db Pictured above are screenshots of the full 128x128 character pixel canvas being filled with a test texture so you can see the extent of the sprite canvas on the AnimatedSprite3D, as well as what the player object looks like in the engine viewport. Any and all help would be greatly appreciated. submitted by /u/JNSStudios_YT [link] [comments]",

      "content": "I was talking one-on-one with someone recently when a familiar moment came up. A pause where I knew what I was supposed to say. The kind of response that smooths things over and keeps everything comfortable. I felt it form automatically. The right words, the reassuring tone, the version of myself that makes things easier for others. This time, I didn’t say it. I stayed quiet longer than felt polite. The silence was uncomfortable, but it was honest. Saying what was expected would have meant setting aside something I wasn’t ready to dismiss. Eventually, the conversation moved on without the reassurance I would usually give. Nothing exploded. Nothing broke. What stayed with me was realizing how often I trade honesty for harmony without even noticing. I’m still figuring out where that balance should be, but choosing not to perform that moment felt like a small boundary I hadn’t known I was allowed to have. submitted by /u/Rich_Outcome8649 to r/self [link] [comments]",

I worked for my daughters first year and have been home the last year and a half. Recently I’ve really realized the flow of the home, weather the house is happy and flowing or chaotic if really down to me as the wife, mom, and home maker. I have an incredibly helpful husband but he goes in to weekend flow mode because that’s what he knows. He’s been home the last 10 weeks with me and new baby. The magic of Christmas and making memories is down to me as mom. It all feels a little intimidating realizing that it feels like I always have to be a step ahead, on my A Game , getting up early, and planning ahead to be a good present mom who has the time play with my two little kids. It’s a constant crazy balancing act and if I’m not always on and going the systems fall apart. How are other moms handling this?? For reference we live in a very small old space and we cloth diaper and cloth paper towels to save money, no paper plates. So there is always laundry, dishes , always fighting old house smell, constant pick up due to no play room. Toys are in strategic bins all around our small house. submitted by /u/SMFKT_99_17_21 to r/CatholicWomen [link] [comments]",

In Persona 5 I guess this would translate to how much of the compendium could you fill via recruiting persona's and fusing them together before you send the calling card for each palace? I know technically it's possible to reach level 99 in kamoshida (o7 to YourBudTevin for the grind) so hypothetically is there ever a point in which you would run out of fusions to make only having the pool of kamoshida to work with from the start? submitted by /u/Alex_Drewskie to r/Persona5 [link] [comments]",

      "content": "I’m looking to get a fitting at club champion (due to gift card there specifically). Initially I was only planning to use the driver fitting in order to get shaft specs that fit my swing more. The current promo lets you use the fitting price as a credit towards a club. I have 3 year old fitted irons currently, but feel like I would benefit from a fitting as my handicap has dropped from a ~18 > 9 at this point. I’ve never had a driver/wood, hybrid, wedge, or putter fitting. The gift card I have is $180, enough for a driver fitting without the promotional sale ($50 if buying a custom club). The fitting price for a full bag, with the purchase of a new club, is $100. An idea I had was the use this promotional period to get a full bag fitting for “cheap”, and then use my $180 gift card to buy the cheapest club that would make me qualify for the promo. So my question to the community is, how much do you think the cheapest custom club purchase would be? I’ve read that they have all those extra costly fees like the build fee and the “puring” fee. I’m just trying to weigh the difference in pricing and whether to just use the gift card for a normal driver fitting without the discount and paying for a club, or taking advantage of the full bag fitting opportunity. TLDR- what’s the cheapest custom club purchase that I can make at club champion in order to take advantage of the full bag fitting promotion for $100 submitted by /u/Solid-Drop-2780 to r/golf [link] [comments]",

I know Mikan feels like she would be a waste of a survivor slot so if they were thinking of making her a survivor, I feel like they might have to make her more useful throughout the game and build more confidence for herself throughout the trials and potentially help our protagonist out as like a support of sorts In summary: Im PRAYING for mikan being a survivor but something is telling she might be a victim. leaning towards Survivor Most upvoted character gets to be talked about tomorrow Make your predictions for Mikan, too if you so please. submitted by /u/OneDragonfruit8042 to r/DanganAndChaos [link] [comments]",

A lot of speculation has surfaced about this ending, such as you needing a perfect performance to complete (or the complete opposite, a terrible performance), attempting to romance Malevola, or aceing every single hacking sequence (including the optional ones). I was wondering if anyone had tried just not choosing any responses when you're able? Not sure if anyone knew this, but if you let the decision timer run out, it just picks a decision for you, and though I haven't tested it, I think it might be possible this isn't random, which leads me to think a possible way to get the ending is literally do nothing.

      "content": "In the mid-long term future, I plan to leave my job in a western studio and start a western-style indie PC games studio in Asia. Not sure what's a best investment until then, learning Chinese or Japanese (traveled to both). As for China: Future stability . Risk of war/economical-visa restrictions/ possible VPN law changes for the Great Firewall. Easier chinese visas, less starting capital required. Harder to get visa-free residency. But Japan's future leans right-wing and anti immigration. Content restrictions are only an issue if selling to the Chinese market (same restrictions for a company in the west selling to Chinese citizens). Much easier to hire/fire talent in China (bigger talent pool, applicants more open to small remote-first studios, lower cost of life/salaries, much much easier to fire a bad hire that would kill the company in a small japanese bootstrapped indie project). Japan talent pool has a worse demographic future. Worse opportunities for outside investment for games. I'm planning to bootstrap with savings, but don't want to close doors to future investment. Chinese publishers invest first in mobile/multiplayer (at least now), not my focus. Western publishers avoid Chinese companies due to worse intellectual property/legal protections. This is usually handled by keeping intellectual property and cash in an empty US Holding Company that outsources development to the Chinese one, but might be too much friction/risk for western investors. China is worse for selling the company. For a western publisher looking to acquire, even if the intellectual property is in the US holding company, it seems like a risk to buy a Chinese dev team that can go dark with a VPN law change. Long-term life/culture. China feels easier to integrate into. Prefer the bustle and hustle rather than the japanese zen with slow grind. Immigrants in Japan struggle to feel \"accepted\". Should I learn Chinese or Japanese during these previous years? China looks better for bootstrapped indies and lifestyle, Japan better for established/publisher focused big companies. submitted by /u/SavingClippy to r/AskAChinese [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Hey everyone! I'm trying to create a compositor effect in 4.5 that processes the color buffer based on stencil buffer values (doing custom highlight and outline effects). I've followed the 'The Compositor' tutorial in the docs, and got things set up the color buffer. So for the next step I've tried to add the depth buffer(1.) and it isn't going well. I thought I could follow the same pattern as using the color buffer in my shader. So in the glsl code I declare my buffer uniforms like so: layout(rgba16f, binding = 0, set = 0) uniform image2D color_tex; layout(rgba16f, binding = 1, set = 0) uniform image2D depth_tex; And in the script I fetch the buffers create uniforms/set as follows: var color_buffer = render_scene_buffers.get_color_layer(view) var color_uniform: RDUniform = RDUniform.new() color_uniform.uniform_type = RenderingDevice.UNIFORM_TYPE_IMAGE color_uniform.binding = 0 color_uniform.add_id(color_buffer) var depth_buffer = render_scene_buffers.get_depth_layer(view) var depth_uniform: RDUniform = RDUniform.new() depth_uniform.uniform_type = RenderingDevice.UNIFORM_TYPE_IMAGE depth_uniform.binding = 1 depth_uniform.add_id(depth_buffer) var uniform_set = UniformSetCacheRD.get_cache(shader, 0, [ color_uniform, depth_uniform ]) The shader compiles just fine. But when I run the script I get a few errors repeating every frame, the first one being ERROR: Image (binding: 1, index 0) needs the TEXTURE_USAGE_STORAGE_BIT usage flag set in order to be used as uniform. Now I'm not sure why I get this error for the depth buffer uniform and not the color buffer. I tried bitwise or'ing the TEXTURE_USAGE_STORAGE_BIT (so depth_uniform.uniform_type = RenderingDevice.UNIFORM_TYPE_IMAGE | TEXTURE_USAGE_STORAGE_BIT ), but that gave me an error stating that the uniform_type value was out of bounds. So I'm not really sure where I am going wrong. Clearly I am misunderstanding something. Is anyone able to point me in the right direction to figuring this out? submitted by /u/FernwehSmith [link] [comments]",

      "content": "I am seriously thinking about suing the executive deciders of SFA for releasing a show which basically fucks with the emotions of all lifelong Star Trek fans. SFA is constantly insulting me and my intellect, so is the post-burn timeline which never should have picked up in another series. I see 2 options: either we come together and pull off some kind of blitzkrieg legal battle, which eventually forces Paramount (or whichever subsidiary is on charge right now) to never release another episode of that clusterfuck of emotional molestation. This might be hard to do, given the fact that they already dared to release 4 episodes, with a fifth one due for next week. Even if we hire the most slaughter-ready lawyers it might be to late to make them stop. The other more sane, more effective option would be to have someone on the inside who identifies all digital copies, production files and master images of that show and make them go away without a chance of restoration. This would need some kind of administrative access, and of course a person with lots of honor and selflessness. There are times when people are implored to act by their fellow civil brothers and sisters. This time is now. Only Paramount superusers can stop the destruction of our franchise. Yes if we delete all SFA copies now, there’d be still the 4 episodes floating around but they can always be considered to be a tragic example of selfish corporate media frenzy, an attack on fandom itself. We can’t tolerate NuTrek anymore. Sue or delete, what it’s gonna be? submitted by /u/Thizzor to r/trektalk [link] [comments]",

After around 50-70 hours things will start to making sense as long as you are focused on improving each game My movement still sucks i forget to press crouch after dashing/mantling and sometimes i shoot my own creeps or get lost but I am really glad I stuck with it. My last 5 games i dropped 10-20 kills.

      "content": "I have run into a scenario on multiple occasions where players are informed ahead that my game is not easy. Not mechanically but I am going to delve into some pretty reprehensible topics. Vile darkness etc.... I always ask players to let me know what is off limits. I do not wish to make people uncomfortable as I have very few limits myself. Most my players are the limit. I have no issues with really abhorrent things if it's done for the right reasons and not just shock value (Though sometimes that is a good thing). I find myself running into too many players saying they have no limits then going. HEY! That's too far!. It's too far I get it. We won't pursue this. Why did you not tell me this before? It would not have come up? Does anyone else have this problem? I run games about violence and its consequences among other such things such as power dynamics. This shit is dark and I refuse to glorify it. Why can't people just be honest? So many problems can be avoided. I am not talking about the really obviously avoided things. It's the smaller stuff that is setting them off. Players if you have a problem with a topic and the GM and you are asked PLEASE be honest and say so that way it does not come up. I am not a fan of X-Cards or even doing these kinds of checks ins since people lie but I don't know what to do at this point. No one seems to have a problem until they do. When asked \"Why didn't you say I would have happily avoided it?\" They go this shit is disturbing why would you go there and I am like I am using it BECAUSE it's disturbing. I want to face this. All of my writing is very personal and my last game I wrote essentially consisted of a me writing about coping with suicidal ideation and moving through it and never say those words but the professional health workers I played with picked up on it immediately. Tell the DM if you can't handle the topic. Don't lie and say you can. Please... I know some times we thinkwe can but discover we cannot but I have heard too many times now. I didn't have a problem..... when it clearly was not true. submitted by /u/Forsaken-0ne to r/rpg [link] [comments]",

Bonus points for making her relevant in the NEXT patch, thus making this argument kind of obsolete. What if they randomly decided to give Vivian a swimsuit skin in OCTOBER, but NOT Miyabi, who as an ice character would (probably) be able to resist the cold. Bonus points if they acknowledge the fact that it was weird for them to do that since it was no longer summer time. What if they gave literal NPCs, characters that you literally CAN'T PLAY AS and thus won't be able to see as much, a skin, but NOT the VERY playable Hoshimi Miyabi. Bonus for giving them to NPCs that are actually popular, which would give this point less traction. What if they gave PAN FUCKING YINHU, a character who probably has like 5 fans, a skin, but NOT Miyabi, who is one of if not the MOST popular character in the game.

All for at best a 5% chance per TOUR to get an Australium Weapon. Yareli (Warframe). Yareli was a Warframe in the game that while not necessarily optimal, was very fashionable and unique. How do you get it? By completing an hours long quest line requiring you to perform extremly difficult tricks on a K-Drive, a rather Niche mechanic that (up until then), no one had any reason to use. I heard that it was made much easier, but I still will never get back the hours I spent on that quest. Characters in any any HoyoVerse game. The characters in all hoyoverse games often have very unique character designs, backstories, and great voice actors. However, to get these characters you either have to spend absurd amounts of money, or grind the most tedious, insanity inducing tasks for weeks on end to save up enough of whatever in-game currency to get any reasonable chance of getting ONE character.

I decided to try Hipobuy after their recent site update, and it’s actually way more convenient than I expected. You can use cnfans links directly on Hipobuy without converting them, and cnfans spreadsheets seem to work fine too. The whole site just feels smoother and more reliable overall. They also brought back 30% off shipping coupons, which is nice. On top of that, if you forward your packages from the cnfans warehouse to Hipobuy, they pay for your domestic shipping, which is kind of crazy. I haven’t really seen another agent offer something like that before. With all the issues going on with cnfans, switching to Hipobuy honestly feels like the logical move at this point. Has anyone else tried Hipobuy yet, or been running into the same problems with cnfans? submitted by /u/an-intelectual-being to r/RepVirgins [link] [comments]",

Use NordVPN normally for up to 30 days. If you don’t want to keep it, just request a refund & they process it without hassle. That’s how people are getting both the lowest price and a risk free trial. I wasn’t sure at first, but I tried it myself and it worked fine. Important Note: Skip “coupon code” sites.

      "content": "basically, my theory is that ralsei and the knight are “pure darkners” which are made of nothing but dark, this allows them to leave the dark world, and after a while in the light world, they will turn into their item (ralsei into glowshard, knight into shadow crystal), and maybe possibly, there was a time before the knight was evil where ralsei and the knight knew each otherl and if you’re like “oh ralsei says that he’s a darkner!!!” im still saying that he’s a darkner, and he doesn’t want them to knoe that he’s basically the same thing as the knight, thinking that kris and susie will hate him. This also allows them to leave the dark world and enter different ones without turning to stone, and it works like yinyang, the knight is yin, and ralsei is yang (alot of people make the mistakr of thinking that yin is the white). This theory is also very anti-papyrus knight. submitted by /u/Lucky_Rice8262 to r/Deltarune [link] [comments]",

I have to keep swapping weapons, reload my GL, fire, swap weapons, switch back to GL, reload, fire, swap weapons, then back to the GL and reload. . . So on and so forth.

I have all my graphics setting turned down to their lowest possible levels. I have done all the optimization troubleshooting methods. Ive tried running the game as an administrator, but the game refuses to launch when I do that. There's no fixing it. My computer is fully capable of running STALKER 2.

This time I want to say that I intend to adapt the two Pokémon Legends games, and I wanted to show my proposals. Legends Arceus: The story will tell the origin of the Fujiwara Family, and of the one who started it all, Christopher Fujiwara. He was a character of unknown origin who was chosen by Arceus and as a bonus received a natural gift for Aura, something that his descendants would inherit and improve. And in the future it is revealed that Christopher married Akari. Legends ZA: This one is still in the planning phase, but the biggest difference is that the game will take place 20 to 25 years after XY, to show my characters older, married and with children, including my OCs, and the protagonists being precisely those children. But it's also an idea that I might apply to the Tenth Region, but that may depend a lot on how it turns out. Soon I intend to make a post talking about the love interests of my OCs, but for now I would like to know what you thought of these ideas for the Legends Saga. submitted by /u/UsualWishbone4416 to r/pokemonfanfiction [link] [comments]",

      "content": "About three years ago I was making a music video and found I really liked environmental storytelling and world building. I decided my next project would be a video game. Since I already had quite a bit of experience in Blender and virtually none in any game engines I decided I’d figure out a development approach that lets me do most of the heavy-lifting in Blender. That’s how I ended up with a game that is 90% pre-rendered. The overworld backgrounds, the cutscenes and even the turn-based combat is all pre-rendered. It’s a bit of a nightmare to work with at times but I’m really happy with the result. The way I’d describe the game itself is a mix of Disco Elysium, Fear and Hunger, Look Outside and Bioshock. For the Disco Elysium inspiration, I wanted to create a world that felt truly lived-in with lively dynamic characters who are shaped by the world they inhabit. It also has a similar system for handling skill checks and there being multiple solutions to quests. For Fear and Hunger and Look Outside, this is the exploration, scavenging and combat elements of the game. I was especially inspired by the unique encounter design in Look Outside. Bioshock is a huge inspiration for the setting. I’ve wanted more games set in doomed underwater cities so I decided to go out and make my own.

I thought about this kind of a solution: When change-gravity-button is pressed, a collision sphere gets first collision and its normal and sends it to gravity component, where it then interpolates character global position to collision point global position, counts difference between floor and character in angles and rotates it so player is perpendicular to the floor, and whenever we change walking surface the algorithm repeats submitted by /u/murdered_ronin [link] [comments]",

      "content": "I had an experience in Warzone that honestly crossed a line for me, and I think this is something the developers need to look at from a design perspective. A player used the hostage/carry mechanic in a way that visually resembled a sexual assault scenario, undeniably. I know the intent of the mechanic is tactical and gameplay-driven, but the way character models animate and how players can position themselves makes it very easy for someone to create something that looks extremely disturbing and inappropriate. Player downed me, took me hostage and took me to the corner of the wall simulating rape action. It triggered my PTSD! This isn’t about trash talk or normal toxicity — this is about how a gameplay animation can be misused to simulate something horrific. It caught me off guard and genuinely made me uncomfortable. I’m not blaming the game for player behavior, but I do think this is an unintended visual outcome of the mechanic that should be reviewed. Small animation or positioning restrictions could prevent this from happening without affecting gameplay. Has anyone else seen this? And how can we get this in front of the devs so they can adjust the mechanic? I’ve reported the player, but I think this is a design oversight that deserves attention. submitted by /u/Aggressive_Bill_2822 to r/Warzone [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Hey everyone, A sentiment I hear a lot, and agree with, is that making indie games solo isn’t really something you can live off. I haven’t shipped anything yet (partly for this reason) and can’t speak from experience, so I’d love to hear from people who actually have. If you’re a solo dev, what’s your day job? How do you manage financially while working on your games? For you, is game dev a side hustle/ hobby, or are you trying to make it full time? I’m especially curious to hear from devs with a coding or software background like mine, though all experiences are welcome. Honest answers are really appreciated. submitted by /u/nauman_arshad [link] [comments]",

Funnily enough, doing so spoiled a big twist in the story: those guys were bandits and captured the real Jaromier! With everyone dead, I’m free to roam about and find all the clues like how they have weapons and armor stocked and even a Leipa shield (so they must be the same bandits who ambushed us at the start?), and you even get to chat with Jaromier in the dungeons to learn the full story. I feel like I accidentally advanced the plot by a couple hours and I noticed the killing spree will take a huge toll on your reputation: it makes no sense because those are bandits! And even after you wipe out everyone and returned to Trosky, you still have to go back and attack the fortress…..even though I already killed everyone?

It's a genuine broken product that does not play on anything because of rockstar games not patching the game properly. They used pirated files to make the game run and those pirated files trigger the anti piracy measures when attempting to play the game. Yet steam are still selling it broken for actual money? Doesn't this break consumer laws? It even says works on Steam Deck? Completely laughable. How do we get rockstar to acknowledge this issue? Or at least steam to take action, it's pretty ridiculous.

      "content": "Hi everyone. I’ve been working for quite a while on a platform called Homespace ( https://store.steampowered.com/app/2508170/Homespace/ ). The core idea is that players build virtual homes and then play mini-games inside them. Recently, I decided to make a key focus of the project the idea that Unreal Engine developers could create their own mini-games, publish them, and sell them within our platform. It seems to me that creating mini-games is much easier than developing full-fledged games — even small indie ones — and if we already have an audience, this could be a very low-barrier entry point for developers. Moreover, we could provide an additional source of income for level and mini-game creators. And on a broader level, even if hardcore Unreal developers aren’t particularly interested, we’d still be lowering the entry barrier to game development for regular users — encouraging them to start experimenting with Unreal and even coding if they want to do so within our ecosystem. What do you think about this idea? Am I right in this assumption, and does it make sense to implement something like this at all? submitted by /u/General-Lock-1079 [link] [comments]",

In reality, I was just addicted to video games 90% of the time and did a bit of video editing. That was the cold harsh truth that they couldnt accept. After I conquered my video game addiction in my mid teens and started actually socialising they were dissappointed in me and continued to pressure me to do IT courses which I hated. I told my father that he basically enabled my video game addiction which ruined my childhood and early teens and yet hes still in denial. Well at least I actually did became a video editor/camereman at a local TV station but obviously the pay isnt as great as software devs but I'm happy and I get to meet interesting people, also being an attractive man sorrounded by mostly female colleagues feels great to say the least, haha.

      "content": "Hey everyone! 👋 While I'm hard at work figuring out how I'm going to get this game off the ground, I figured I'd give you guys another sneak peek at one of the abilities: DEFLECT! 👀 ♦️ Deflect is a defensive move belonging to the Magician class. If a Magician is shot while deflecting, the bullet will be deflected back at the shooter and deal damage! This makes it great for deterring the aggressive playstyle of the Mule, and can create strong opportunities to get a free reload off when down in the count. I'm super excited to keep showing off more of the game when the time is right. I've put a lot of heart into this game, so I want to make sure I give it a proper launch. 😁 Let me know if you have any other class ideas you think would be cool to see in game! submitted by /u/Calm_Salamander_2447 to r/rblxoutlaws [link] [comments]",

You're also incredibly lazy. You've done nothing for the game, and your newest additions are incredibly sloppy(like Riparia). Now, I'm not saying Riparia isn't pretty, the coding is just a s*** fest. It's a horrible map in that regard. I avoid it. Your modding community has shown more love and care for the game than you do. You just rake in the money and let them make the game for you. You should be ashamed of yourselves. Genuinely consider giving the game to the modding community. You clearly have done so in a less literal sense. You take suggestions(which are insanely easy to code and take little to no effort), and put them \"under consideration\" for years. It's depressing. Please get your s*** together. I've never had this many issues with a game in my LIFE. Not even THE SIMS 2 ON A MODERN PC has given me this many issues. It's easier to reinstall the Sims 2 from the ground up than to run POT.

For the card game, I used opposing and matching elements instead of numbers. There's also a round element, and whoever has the most of that element's icon on the board at the end of the round gets a bonus. Tried to make it as self-explanatory as I could while still providing multiple avenues for points and victories.

I needed to destroy the object but to leave the PS for all of the particles to die beforehand. I tried destroying the model first, and then particle system, however it was not possible because while trying to destroy the children of cloned object I got an error telling me that I am trying do destroy prefabs. But doing so with the parent object (which was instantiated) works. I tried unparenting the PS as the tutorial showed, using transform.parent = null. But the error popped up saying the parrent cannot be null. I will try to just make two separate objects one with model and one with particle system and instantiate them. But it feels a bit clanky?

      "content": "I have 12V LED lights in my camper. During camping season, I power them with a portable power station and they work without any issues. In the winter, instead of the power station, I connect the LED lights directly to the truck’s starter battery using an always-hot cigarette outlet that I installed in the truck bed. With this setup, I’m not getting any power to the lights, and I’m not sure why. I know the cigarette outlet itself works because I use it to charge my portable power station. That makes me think the issue is either: • a voltage incompatibility, or. • the cable I’m using to connect the LED lights to the outlet. The LEDs are connected using a 5.5 × 2.1 mm (5521) to male cigarette lighter cable. This cable works in other setups and outlets, but I’m wondering if there’s something about this specific outlet, connection, or voltage that’s preventing the lights from powering on.

Took me awhile, but I'm quite happy with how they turned out. They are both low level and equipped with gear from the early game that I believe some Vermundian Soldiers use, but it's all fully upgraded so they should be able to handle even Battahl and Volcanic Island given the chance. Here are their \"specs\": ---- -Vernia Female Figther (level 21) Calm Inclination Skills: Burst Strike, Cloudward Slash, Hindsight Sweep, Full Moon Slash ID: 7RHJ1Z18M2H4 ---- -Baenlin Male Mage (level 20) Kindhearted Inclination Skills: High Halidom, High Celerity, High Palladium, Lightning Affinity ID: JLC5D7QYUXX4 (Vermundian mages usually only cast Flagration and Fire Boon, but I don't think that would make a very fun pawn to have around, so I gave him some different skills). ---- If anyone fancies having some Vermundian soldiers for pawns, here they are. In case you hire any of them, hope it's to your liking! I also want to, eventually, create an Archer Vermundian Pawn, but creating these, even with the help of a late game safe file, is a bit time consuming, so maybe an idea for another time.

Now normally I wouldnt even be mad and sad cuz it's just a game, but those pets were all gifts that my girlfriend made to me. She sacrificed many pets in her account, even things she loved Just for getting me some pets i likes. And now, all my pets, all her sacrifices: GONE. I dont even know this guy/girl. I dont even remember playing with him in a server. I dont even wake up at 6 AM, I wake up a 7 AM. Now i feel mad, and sad, and most of all, i feel like i broke a promise, and despite all the times She told me \"it's not your fault\", i still think it's my fault. Maybe if i decided to login earlier something would've changed. Maybe if i decided to transfer my pets to another account this could've been avoided. I Hope that my report will be seen and that this story will be ready, and that this scum of a human being Will be banned, over and over and over and over and over. Thank you for your time. -Qbic (AKA Fakeranni) (NOTE: I never asked her for pets, She just gave them to me, not even knowing if i wanted them or not, and this makes me even more mad.

But I'm just not sure if I should still be trying to sell these off to improve my OVR or if I've reached a stage where holding these makes sense. submitted by /u/SuspiciousLaughThrow to r/Football_Head_Coach [link] [comments]",

      "content": "There seems to be an obsession with adding online multiplayer to every game. At this point, it feels like every game is expected to have online features, but honestly, I think a lot of players struggle to find people to play with, and many of us don’t want to sit in a lobby listening to a horde of screaming kids. Making VR games is already difficult for indie devs, and supporting online multiplayer makes it even harder, and most importantly, it often results in less overall content. I could give many examples, but take Battle Talent for instance. It’s one of my favorite VR games: it has tons of systems, lots of enemy types, lots of weapons, etc. The devs have been pushing updates for a long time, which is great, and those updates are genuinely impressive. But over the past year they’ve been focusing heavily on online features, and personally I lost interest, while still thinking adding more core content could really transform this indie title into something totally unmatched in VR. Another example is Undead Citadel, which had a relatively lukewarm launch. Many people were disappointed by the amount of contents (not the gameplay itself), and now it looks like the team is working on a “multiplayer update.” Honestly, I just hope they add more than multiplayer (and from what I’ve seen, it seems they will). Online play, sandbox modes, mod support… all of that is nice to have. But to me, it’s more like the icing on the cake, not the cake itself. How do you guys feel? Is it just me coping because I have no friends, or do you also miss content-heavy single-player games? submitted by /u/Enculin to r/VRGaming [link] [comments]",

I'd like to avoid this. My first instinct would be to put an underscore before the parameter, e.g.: func _init(_character: Character) -> void: character = _character But, using an underscore on a parameter is the indicator to Godot to ignore unused parameters... so I don't want to use an underscore here. My next instinct would be to put a $ before the parameter, e.g.: ``` This is NOT valid code func _init($character: Character) -> void: character = $character ``` But $ have a special meaning in Godot and are not valid characters in a parameter name. Unfortunately, the official style guide also doesn't mention anything about this. Anyone have any clever, clean, universal approaches to this problem? submitted by /u/samanime [link] [comments]",

      "content": "I’ve always found this take that Luka would have multiple rings if he was on the Celtics to be flawed for many reasons: Preventing player development: Luka Doncic, a player that’s very ball dominant would likely mean the Celtics guard duo of Derrick White and Payton Pritchard wouldn’t have been able to develop into the players they are today because of Luka’s usage rate. Defensive liability: The Celtics built their championship team around the idea that their starting 5 players could switch onto an opposing player and defend them to a decent degree. With Luka on the court teams would have an immediate weak link to hunt on offense. Disrupts the Celtics balanced attack: The Celtics championship run consisted of multiple players that could get 20 points a game and with Luka’s usage you would’ve definitely seen less games where Porzingis or Jrue would’ve been able to showcase their offensive talent. It would’ve also made the five-out offense less reliable as most of the three-point shot attempts would be coming from one guy making the Celtics a more predictable team. This is further shown by the struggles he had playing with Porzingis. Similarly, would Jalen Brunson take the jump to the next level if he was still playing with the mavericks and Luka. This is not me arguing that Jayson Tatum could’ve taken Luka’s 2024 mavericks to the finals but I believe people often try to use this argument to prove that one player only wins because of their roster rather than understand how a player is able to fit and adapt to a system which matters more in determining the success they’d have on that team. submitted by /u/Majestic-Web-367 to r/NBATalk [link] [comments]",

You have to set their font sizes at increments of 16px which I thought was convenient at first but it makes it harder to adjust. Anytime I try to go lower than 16px or I scale it down, text just becomes jumbled up and unreadable. It does go with the project very well and now I’m torn between deciding if I should go ahead with this or just replace it with a regular font.

I was at the Knight level, and got unlucky with falling over in the slums and getting immediately killed on the ground. Now I’m in the Abyss, with 90 of these god damn zombies to kill. 90. That’s insane. The little fuckers are impossible because only dismemberment seems to do the job, but given most weapons at man-at-arms and above are focussed on bludgeoning - this becomes an absolute chore. Not to mention even when all their bones are broken and they’re just lying there, they still don’t count as a kill, even if they can’t get up or do anything. This, on top of the fact that the larger weapons all feel like wiffle bats and are terrible at cutting now - makes the abyss by far the worst part of the game. What are your opinions on the abyss?

On top of that, a lot of Taobao or Alibaba links either bug out or don’t show up at all, and even tracking and QC pics have been hit or miss. It’s getting pretty frustrating to deal with. I decided to try Hipobuy after their recent site update, and it’s actually way more convenient than I expected. You can use cnfans links directly on Hipobuy without converting them, and cnfans spreadsheets seem to work fine too. The whole site just feels smoother and more reliable overall. They also brought back 30% off shipping coupons, which is nice. On top of that, if you forward your packages from the cnfans warehouse to Hipobuy, they pay for your domestic shipping, which is kind of crazy. I haven’t really seen another agent offer something like that before. With all the issues going on with cnfans, switching to Hipobuy honestly feels like the logical move at this point.

The environment is a hot mess right now lol. But I’ll eventually replace everything with art my friend and I are making on Clip Studio.

      "content": "In episode 16 of Gnosia, Remnan worries about being caught running away unlawfully and being captured if the D.Q.O. goes to a base. I've finished the game too, so I know that in it, his concern is rather about having to \"see\" someone. I'm curious about any theories/reasoning for the reasons for his concern in the anime. Is running away unlawfully really that big of a concern? Even if he left a planet without going through the correct process, this is because he escaped slavery. Wouldn't an exception be made? Or is he simply worried about the process of having to clarify this? Alternatively, if he ran away illegally, this could imply that slavery is legal in Gnosia, or has different legalities depending on the planet. However, I always figured Manan kept Remnan secret from anyone outside of her trusted circle. In the game, his worry about having to see someone is very vague, but from his events and general demeanor, the player is naturally made to think about Manan. It would make sense that, if he reported to a military base, she could possibly find out and track him down, at least in his POV. What do you all think? I'm open to discussion regarding this. Either way, it was nice to finally have a Remnan and Raqio moment adapted to the anime. submitted by /u/proboty to r/Gnosia_ [link] [comments]",

No matter what settings I use there's this ghosting on the item I'm holding and everything becomes blurry whenever I move and it's making me dizzy and hurting my eyes. The only time the ghosting and blur when moving is gone is when I use FXAA. But now I have a new problem where everything is too sharp. The clip I uploaded is just me showing the blur and ghosting I'm talking about but I've tried doing dlss on and off, full screen, windowed etc. I tried limiting fps, turning the motion blur on and off, global illumination on and off, going from low to ultra settings. But nothing changes. It's still blurry and has that ghosting effect except for when I use fxaa which makes everything too sharp and still makes my eyes hurt. Outside the settings I've also tried the compatability mode I've seen people suggesting in the forums but still it has this same effect. I tried searching for solutions but not much people seem to be having the same issues as me. Thank you for the help in advance.

While that's fine, I don't really think a game jam is the place to do that. Especially before the theme is even announced. I find this to be very frustrating as it introduces a lot of scope creep and can cause you to fixate on a \"dream game\" that may not even be that great or related to the theme. To me, making a game for a game jam is about a fresh idea, that's short and sweet. Not system heavy and full of unfinished ideas. Maybe I'm being an ass, I don't know. I'm also not confrontational, so I'm not going \"Let's not do this, let's focus on finishing something then adding 'flavor' to it afterwards.\" It's just everytime, I regret not working solo. submitted by /u/Same_Bar4349 [link] [comments]",

Originally I tried getting the direction like this but it wasn't super accurate var target_direction = (hit_position - self.global_position).normalized() bounce_line_2d.add_point(collider.global_position) bounce_line_2d.add_point(hit_position + target_direction * 200) Using the normal is closer but still inaccurate if shape_cast_2d.is_colliding(): var hit_position = shape_cast_2d.get_collision_point(0) var normal = shape_cast_2d.get_collision_normal(0) var collider = shape_cast_2d.get_collider(0) trajectory_line_2d.add_point(self.global_position) trajectory_line_2d.add_point(hit_position) collision_preview.global_position = hit_position collision_preview.visible = true if collider.is_in_group(\"balls\"): var target_direction = -normal bounce_line_2d.add_point(collider.global_position) bounce_line_2d.add_point(collider.global_position + target_direction * 200) The balls are rigid bodies and to detect collision im using a shape cast that's the same size as the ball.

      "content": "Hi everyone, I’m a music producer and I’ve always loved video games, and I’d really like to connect with devs who are working on cool projects. I make music that could fit different types of games, mostly synthwave, ambient, and classical, but I can adapt depending on the mood or vibe. I want to be upfront that I’m trying to make some money doing this too, but I also really want to collaborate and be part of something cool. I’m not trying to overcharge anyone, I just want to work with people who care about what they’re making. If you need music for levels, menus, boss fights, or anything like that, feel free to reach out in DM's or comments. Demo tracks: [Feel free to listen to everything!]( https://open.spotify.com/intl-fr/track/4WgYqGKQpfb4U40MNFDolh?si=49a8ca4995b04c56 ) Thanks for reading, and I’d love to hear what you’re working on. submitted by /u/Gouapato to r/gameDevClassifieds [link] [comments]",

However I noticed with the \"process call : physics\" my character was not having problems but the other elements moving (the cars in this case) were jittering a little when my character (thus the camera) were moving. When I put the process call to Idle, my character was jittering since I use the physics process, but the cars werent. Is there a way to fix the issue other than using physics process on the cars since they don't really need physics ?

      "content": "Idk who needs to hear this but: I know we all roll our eyes at the “I can fix him” thing when it comes to women trying to rehabilitate toxic men, but I think a lot of us are still susceptible to the notion that if we just love our female or nb partners hard enough they will finally, eventually treat us right. …Sorry to say but, they probably won’t. If your partner consistently does things that hurt you or make you feel insecure or undervalued, *love will not change them.* If your gut tells you they’re maybe just kind of with you until they find someone “better,” you cannot love them into loving you fully. If they rant to you about how horrible all their ex partners & friends are — *you are not a break in the cycle, you’re just on the next loop-de-loop* — If it’s that many people, it’s not their exes, it’s not you: it’s them. I know we all want to believe that people can change, and trust me - I know how difficult it is to cut the cord when someone alternates hurtful behavior with lovebombing - when you keep seeing flashes of the person you wish they’d be. That’s often enough to keep people trapped in bad relationships for years. But if any part of this resonates with you, please try to take it to heart that you deserve better. You have to be a kind and patient person in order to want to help “fix” a broken person, but you may be breaking yourself in the process without even realizing it. You’re not a bad person for walking away from a toxic situation. I promise there is a better relationship out there, with someone who will actually appreciate and return the love and kindness you are currently pouring into ((whoever they are)) submitted by /u/uta_refson to r/actuallesbians [link] [comments]",

This is what happens when you grew up in 80s NYC clubs: Area, The Tunnel, Visage, The Palladium - - - and you refuse to settle for algorithmic bullshit. This is me spanning 50 YEARS of music (yes, fifty) because I'm genre agnostic and I don't care what decade it came from if it makes me FEEL like a woman, not a demographic. You won't find force-fed \"empowerment anthems\" here, no drunk-girl-screaming playlist everyone makes, nothing that sounds like it came from a focus group. What you WILL find is Blondie's \"Call Me\" from 1980 sitting right next to Peggy Gou's \"(It Goes Like) Nanana\" from 2023. You'll find Basia -- BASIA, because who the heck remembers her? I do. You'll find Laufey's \"From The Start\" making you swoon before Purple Disco Machine makes you move. Grace Jones, Donna Summer, CHIC—the queens who taught the game. WAR and Earth, Wind & Fire because sometimes you need funk, not feelings. Chappell Roan and RAYE because good music doesn't have an expiration date. This playlist is for the women who know that Fleetwood Mac's \"Everywhere\" from 1987 still hits you different every time, who can dance to Sheila B. Devotion's French disco , who appreciate that Lianne La Havas and Jessie Ware exist, who remember when Madonna made music that mattered, who understand that Dua Lipa's \"Levitating\" belongs right next to Michael Jackson's \"Rock With You.\" This isn't a nostalgia trip and it's not a \"new music\" playlist.

I really want to get 2 sets of travel battle and combine them to make a 40 inch length 10 inch depth field of battle, since it works for my space. My question is, I understand that the native rulesets are very light, and that it is the rules that really make the war game and not the pieces.

The video capture is from my macbook. I don't know if it helps but I am using the Noray stack by Netfox (open source) that I am hosting on DigitalOcean. The server deployment was very easy, but I had to re adjust few things in my game while learning new multiplayer concepts...

      "content": "Hey there, after spending hundreds of hours in the game flipping everything to see what's there and what is not, I really started loving Hytale. Even though it's early access, it's an amazing game that seriously has infinite potential. As someone that has loved playing games all his life and never had anything giving me the feeling that Skyrim and Minecraft gave me back in the day, Hytale comes pretty darn close. In fact it is so good, I really want to put my life into its progression! I started to learn coding/ modding a bit, created the first 2-3 mob/npc designs with animations and already created several Al's for ingame behaviour. Sadly I have no qualifications on paper whatsoever, only my work that's been done. Does anyone know, how the Hytale/ Hypixel team could see me? I have infinite ideas, infinite time and an infinite desire for this project. Even though I am nothing special obviously. I don't even need nearly the salary they promised to employees, I'd be happy with less than half of what people earn there. Just want to be a part of something amazing for once I'll add pictures of the creations below, I made them completely from 0, no templates, no help. (Please keep in mind, I started modding, designing, blockbench and animating on blockbench 3 days ago..) I’ll keep at it, keep ya updated and wish y’all a nice week! submitted by /u/Old-Ad-8307 to r/hytale [link] [comments]",

It’s code, made by some random guy, who has no legal or moral obligation not to completely screw you. What is wrong with playing games in their vanilla form? Is it because you got bored? Here’s a solution: play another game. Instead of taking a chance on code that someone put on the internet, use steam’s time-tested system to get an unmodded game that will function properly and not give you a virus just because it can.

      "content": "Hello, fellow goal-getters! ​ Welcome to our monthly discussion on setting and achieving goals. As we journey through life, it's crucial to have a roadmap and milestones to guide us toward success. This month, we're drawing inspiration from the book that has sparked many transformative journeys - \"The One Thing\" by Gary Keller and Jay Papasan. ​ **The Power of Focusing on \"The One Thing\"** ​ In \"The One Thing,\" Keller and Papasan emphasize the importance of clarity, focus, and prioritization when it comes to achieving your goals. They advocate for finding that \"one thing\" that, when accomplished, will make everything else easier or unnecessary. This concept can be a game-changer in our quest for success. ​ **Monthly Challenge: Define Your \"One Thing\"** ​ Here's our challenge for this month: Take some time to reflect on your goals, whether they're related to your career, personal life, or health. What is that one thing that, if accomplished, would have the most significant positive impact on your journey? ​ - Write it down. - Break it into actionable steps. - Create a timeline. ​ By doing this, you'll have a clear, actionable plan for moving closer to your goals, step by step. ​ **Share Your Insights** ​ We encourage you to share your thoughts, experiences, and progress throughout the month. Have you read \"The One Thing,\" and if so, how has it influenced your approach to goal-setting and achievement? ​ Remember, every journey begins with a single step. Let's take those steps together and support each other in making our dreams a reality. 🚀💪 ​ Stay tuned for more inspiration and motivation as we work toward our \"one thing\" this month! submitted by /u/AutoModerator to r/MarketingOneZeroOne [link] [comments]",

I already finished the game and unlocked the Goat content. However, in the in-game tarot list it still shows 66 out of 85 tarot cards, and the trophy for collecting all tarot cards hasn’t unlocked yet. There os no ??? Card slot, all show some tarot card. I’m playing the base version from PS Plus (no DLC purchased). I dont known what I missing. Maybe some specific tarot cards that have special unlock condition. I’m also missing the last two follower forms in the list, I’d really appreciate clarification where to get them. At this point I just want to make sure: What exactly counts toward the 85 tarot cards? What cards até mandadory for the trophie? Is there any known PS5 / PS Plus version issue I should know about? Any guidance would be hugely appreciated — I’m so close to the platinum and don’t want to miss it before the game leaves PS Plus.

It's a slightly different backroom than usual: the levels, some of which are very similar to those of Backrooms' creepypasta, but others have never been seen but imagined by me or inspired by movies and series or events that actually happened. It's a horror platformer, inspired, you have to look for keys and take coins (the latter is currently a beta), with monsters or levels where you have to overcome some platforms or with puzzles and much more. It's still in early access, but I'd like to make it perfect, and that's why it's in early access, so I'll listen to advice and improvements. The game currently has 10 levels, but I estimate that it will reach 50 or a maximum of 100 levels. Also, for now, the game is in single-player, but I'm already working on multiplayer. I'm also working on a new mode that will be one of the few backroom games that allow you to do this, I don't want to do spoilers, but it will be cool and I want to create a real community about my backroom game. I'll give you a preview of the first level, I want to assure you that this game is a platformer, but it's not just a platformer, we'll also have to solve puzzles, run away from monsters and much more, because I don't want a static game that's dynamic and full of things and choices.

      "content": "Hi, I’m currently working on a ghost function. In my game, the player only moves along one axis (X). What I’ve done is: on Tick, I store the X location each frame in a float array. Then I load that back on the next run. What I’ve noticed is that if the FPS drops in the first round, then the playback won’t be accurate on the second. I’m pretty sure this is because Tick is FPS-dependent. So I’m wondering: is there any way to do some sort of multi-threaded tick that runs independently from FPS? Is “Set Timer by Event” the same as Tick, or would that solve my problem? Or would it help if I only stored the X value every half a second (like calling it every 0.5s)? submitted by /u/Efficient-Regular-30 [link] [comments]",

My problem with most of them is that they are goals, but they are given in the form of advice, like \"put your own needs first\", \"learn to say no\", \"set boundaries\", \"learn about who you are and what you want\", \"focus on yourself\", etc. I hear these and some other ones a LOT and they already make me feel horrible for not being capable of doing them. I haven't gone a full week without shutting down for days, there's absolutely no way I can take care of myself or do basic household chores (or even get up and walk to the bathroom). I'd just be doing chores in a terrible state, with nothing changing, eventually feeling worse. \"Put your own needs first\" is a good goal, but actually doing that leads to more small traumas for me. Absolutely none of these do anything for me. I feel like the emptiness has taken over too much. I've never been able to function. I saw an EMDR therapist for the first time today (just the assessment) and we're starting the work in 2 weeks. I shut down as soon as I got home for unrelated reasons (people in uni).

New Vegas is basically supposed to be the Wild West so why would you live in there and want to be bossed around and taxed by some jarhead liberals? Do you even need the protection/extortion? The Mojave is full of extremely powerful guns basically lying around everywhere in the open. You do not need soldiers to protect you. The NCR npcs are also extremely annoying and aggressive and demand you submit to their fake government authority. At least The Enclave are actually descendants of the original USA government. They have a sort of more legitimate authority even if it is evil. NCR on the other hand are just some libs from California who all of the sudden decided they have a right to rule the entire wasteland. Who made you God? I don’t think anyone voted for the NCR. The game shills them so hard even the devs wore NCR shirts at E3. NCR is obviously a self insert of the devs WOKE libtard ideology and if you choose not to side with them you will have EVIL karma. “Oh but what about the Legion? They are more evil so you have to side with the NCR.” Exactly the same logic the fake left uses to just supporting the democrats every single election. At least the Legion is trying something different from the same ideology that destroyed the entire planet. “but the legion r fascist!!!!1” Oh and NCR are not? Nope NCR are just as much fascist Nazis. They want to bring back the same imperialism usa does. Also it’s clear the devs made the Legion as comically evil as possible to try and force you into supporting the NCR. Nice try libtards. I always side with the Legion anyway. It is more fun to LARP as Juba the Sniper and pwn imperialist NCR skkkum. Now on a another note aesthetically they are also objectively the worst faction. Their uniforms look absolutely hideous. Also forgot to mention Boone is such an overrated and terrible character. He is basically Chris Kyle The American Sniper. A pathetic emo who never shuts up about his stupid wife. lol so edgy, cringe, gross, hateful and vengeful nasty character. He tries to portray himself as some sort of poor ptsd vet hurt by war yet he obviously is a psychopath who just loves violence and killing. Like if you were so morally good you wouldn’t choose to be a sniper merc and follow the courier around killing as many people as possible. This is a character made for people who have a punisher skull on their F150. Boone SUCKS. There are absolutely no redeeming qualities whatsoever about the NCR they are the worst faction to side with for the wasteland. The only faction that comes close to being as bad is the Followers of The Apocalypse who are basically like IRL radlib anarchists who shill for the NCR/Democrat party. The Followers are basically useful idiots for the NCR and do everything they want. WOKE libtard nazis DESTROYED with FACTS and LOGIC. submitted by /u/Sweet-Ad-7887 to r/TrueAnon [link] [comments]",

What we’re suggesting is not “ unnecessary” it’s the bare minimum for realistic college football equipment in 2026. And before anybody starts crying “gameplay first” we AGREE. Gameplay glitches need to be fixed and on field gameplay should be elite. But let’s stop acting like it’s one or the other. EA uses different dev teams for different aspects of the game. The people working on gameplay aren’t the same ones handling player models, uniforms, accessories, and customization. Both can be improved. It’s honestly weird how some of y’all think immersive customization “takes away” from the game. Nobody trashes gameplay suggestions so why force hate on customization requests? It makes no sense. If you want your players wearing outdated or basic gear, cool. That option will still be there. But what’s wrong with letting the people who actually care about customization have the freedom to use newer, more realistic options? Choice doesn’t hurt anyone it only makes the game better. Right now we can’t even equip half the stuff real college athletes wear every Saturday. In a game that’s supposed to be a realistic college football experience, that’s unacceptable.

Features: 5 skills (2.5 million steps worth of content which will always be free) Should work with Apple watches immediately (reads Apple Healthkit for step data) Inventory, leveling, and progression similiar to Runescape No inventory limit, no traveling, and you spend steps like a currency after your walk.

My game is essentially finished (feature complete, playable start to finish), but I’m planning to release in about 9 months. I’ve started reaching out to streamers to build awareness early, but a few have replied saying it’s too far out and to come back closer to launch. At the same time, several gamedev Discords and marketing threads keep saying “reach out as early as possible” and “start building relationships now,” which feels like the opposite advice. So now I’m confused about what’s actually smart here. Thanks! Edit: it's a Halloween game so I wish to release it near Halloween submitted by /u/Vincent_Penning [link] [comments]",

It was also where i found community online with other animators and gamedevs, and really launched my creative path... so i really owe a lot of my life to discovering that program...

It feels like a great era to be making games Super grateful for its existence and the community behind it, because I feel the same way about it now like I did with Flash back in the day!

      "content": "Hey everyone, we’re a small indie team working on a grim dark roguelike, and we’re getting close to our vertical slice. Which is exciting, but also the moment where every decision starts to feel permanent… and slightly terrifying. Before locking ourselves into choices we might regret later, we put together a short survey to get some outside perspective. It touches things like difficulty, punishment, narrative weight, atmosphere, and also the less fun but very real side of indie dev like marketing, discovery, and why players actually trust or wishlist a game. We don’t have a publisher or safety net, so this kind of feedback genuinely helps us avoid shooting ourselves in the foot. The survey is in English, anonymous, and doesn’t take forever. Link here: https://bewdbros.studio/forms/helpusbuildourgame If you feel like helping a fellow indie team make slightly fewer bad decisions, we’d really appreciate it. And if anything interesting comes out of it, we’re happy to share what we learned. Thanks, and good luck surviving your own vertical slice.

I am making a Qi2 Wireless Car Charger to replace the current wireless charger in my car. Since most smartphones nowadays have a large camera bump, I wanted to have a plate that will be pushed down when the phones camera bump is pressed on it, and pushed back up when the phone is removed. The reason I'm posting is because I want to figure out a way to lock the plate in place when the wireless charger is off. This is a nice-to-have since this way, if the wireless charger is off, the plate being locked allows the user to place whatever coins, car keys, or whatever on there without the plate sinking down. I need some kind of electrical mechanical mechanism for this, but I wasn't sure what would be the best one for the job. My first thought was servo motors, but I wanted to ask else I should consider using if I didn't or couldn't use a servo motor. submitted by /u/ThePeacefulOne to r/MechanicalEngineering [link] [comments]",

As an old Metin2 player (I played Metin2 over a decade) Will this bring back the old vibes from Metin2?

I had been interested in starting a game development side project for a few months and had recently built a flappy bird clone in Unity. Then I saw a tutorial series on youtube by HeartBeast about creating an ARPG in Godot 3. After watching that amazing series I decided to choose Godot as the engine. We started developing the game on Godot 4.2 and upgraded to 4.3 and then 4.4 which is what we are currently using. Our studio consists of one full time developer (myself, the founder), a part time developer (my co-founder) as well as a few of our friends who helped with ideas, play testing and some world design. The art assets we used were all sourced from asset packs or commissioned from artists found on Reddit/Itch/Fiverr/Youtube. If you enjoy games like Classic World of Warcraft or Diablo and enjoy pixel art aesthetics then check out our store page! Our public demo is set to debut during Steams February Next Fest! submitted by /u/CreatorOfAedloran [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Hello guys, So my current setup is that I have an animation one shot that as the in parameter has the locomotion blend tree and as the shot parameter an animation state machine. The state machine is used to make the following actions for example: Jump -> Fall-> Land or Jump -> Fall -> Idle (If fallen from low height). My problem is that in the animation state machine, I have the transition from Fall directly to End of the state machine and it has a condition \"ended\" that i set true when in the Fall animation which is looping i want to immediately end the animation to get back to the locomotion. The condition is then reset to false when the animation state machine gets to the End node using the state_entered signal. But then, when adding an Xfade time to the transition, the character seems to have a delay based on the time put there before going back to the locomotion blend tree. Has anyone ever encountered the same problem as me and fixed it? Thank you Animation Blend Tree Node Actions State Machine - Assume that the transtion from Fall to End is Auto and has the \\\"ended\\\" condition submitted by /u/aris1401 [link] [comments]",

The buffs don't seem that impactful, and I don't think the game is very generous with skillpoints either to have players waste a turn just to fix this second HP bar. I'm also not sure how I feel about the specificity of guides. Like, in other games, it's usually more of a system where they are separated based on their class, and then designed to synergize with their intended holder, while others can still make use of them. But here, they just completely remove a guide's passive if you don't match them. I know story-wise they are couples with the esper, but it feels a bit weird. And then I pull a 5\\ guide, and then suddenly I feel pressured to get the esper because its just a guiding effect and a stat stick without them?)

I think part of it is not shocking to them since I'm autistic and have never been into that kind of thing. I am not sure if I am also aromantic or not (I have romantic feelings towards a fictional character and I'm not sure if that disqualifies me), but they don't pressure me about being interested at all in anybody either. Which makes me happy and relieved!! <⁠(⁠￣⁠︶⁠￣⁠)⁠> I told them that if someone would want to marry me as best friends, maybe I would get married. We can hold hands (like I do with all my friends) and hang out and support each other through life without kissing or weird feelings or other gross stuff. But I can't picture myself getting close enough to anyone new to the point of being good friends, let alone partnering up...I am quite socially challenged!! (> ⁠▽⁠ <;⁠) I'm glad that however my life goes, I know that my parents don't expect the \"typical\" life trajectory for me. And unlike some people, they don't tell me someone will come along and make me change. I'm so grateful for my supportive parents. :D submitted by /u/clovermelo to r/actualasexuals [link] [comments]",

Trying new things and pushing my sound in different directions has been a big part of my journey as a musician. Lately, I’ve been wanting to take that experience and apply it to something bigger than personal projects, which is why I’m really interested in getting into game scoring. Video games have always inspired me, not just because of the gameplay, but because of how music and sound design shape the mood and pull you into the world. I’d love to work with developers—indie or otherwise—to help bring their projects to life with original music. If you’re working on a game and need a composer, feel free to reach out. I’d be down to chat and see what we could make together. DM me to hear my stuff submitted by /u/willryn to r/INAT [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Hello! I really hope this post is allowed. I’m a lifelong gamer and musician (22 years of playing guitar) and in the past few years I’ve taken a huge interest in composing music for video games. I have a massive folder in my DAW filled with tracks and ideas spanning numerous genres. I’ve mixed and mastered quite a few specifically for a gaming experience. I would really love to collaborate with an indie studio to make music for. I’m capable of creating every sound, voice, etc etc that would be needed. I can actually probably handle every sound you’d need, creating an original soundtrack and audio that isn’t relying on premade audio assets. I have my own fully functional studio, software, instruments, etc. And I wouldn’t even charge anything unless the game just took off and there was money to be given. Just having my music and audio in a game is enough for me right now while trying to build a reputation off of this. (I’m a firefighter/paramedic in the “real” world). If anyone is needing this particular skill set to help complete your project, I’d be happy to send clips and samples of tracks I’ve made and see if my work can speak for itself. I’ve made everything from synth wave, to 8bit-ish tracks, to Mick Gordon type production Metal. Hope to hear from anyone who wants to work together soon! submitted by /u/SonnofaMitch [link] [comments]",

      "title": "Packed Level Actors - Occlusion, and Culling Performance",
      "content": "I’m curious if anyone knows how PLAs work in terms of Camera and Occlusion culling? What I mean is, in a traditional rendering pipeline one of the benefits of building your level out of modular meshes is that you get Camera Culling. i.e. If you have a tower that is 20 stories tall, but you’re standing at the base of the tower, then everything above the ground floor can be culled as it’s no longer in the view frustrum. Whereas if you make the tower as one piece, then it has to draw the upper floors even if you can’t see them because all of the geo is connected. With Packed Level Actors, the engine supposedly combines meshes to lower draw calls and for efficiency, but are they actually combined as in welded together, or are they still considered separate meshes as far as Culling is concerned? If I’m making a giant tower comprised of thousands of meshes, is it beneficial to turn the entire tower into one Packed Level Actor, or, should I selectively combine the meshes into several dozen PLAs? I’m also curious how PLAs are handled in streaming. If a PLA falls between two level streaming volumes or in two partitions of the world, will it be removed in its entirety or will parts of it be removed (I’ll test this after I post). I’m guessing the entirety will be removed as I believe it is a Blueprint Actor at its core, but maybe it’s not the same?

The majority of them struggle not because they make too little money, but rather because their income is erratic and they don't modify their spending accordingly. People typically spend on their best weeks rather than their average ones when money arrives at random (good week, slow week). Stress begins there. Keeping track of income separate from simply checking your bank balance is one thing that really helps. Decisions become less sentimental and more pragmatic when you can clearly see: - How much you actually make each week or month on average - How much goes toward fuel, food, and fixed bills. For drivers, independent contractors, and small business owners, the game is different; visibility and patterns are more important than rigid monthly budgets. However, budgeting advice frequently assumes a fixed salary. I'm curious about how people with erratic income handle the highs and lows. submitted by /u/NecessaryDrive1043 to r/povertyfinance [link] [comments]",

Let me know if any issues are persisting with StarBinder that I might be able to look at fixing. But as always step one of troubleshooting is to make sure you're using Chrome/Edge as your browser (although apparently for Linux users the preferred browser is Firefox). https://starbinder.space/ --- And for folks who are wondering \" WTF is Star Binder? \", I'll paste the description here: StarBinder is an unofficial Star Citizen browser-based utility I put together that makes keybinds searchable , filterable , and customisable . Unlike the in-game UI, StarBinder lets you combine just about any key combination imaginable (not all of which will work, but it lets you try), plus you can choose between a bunch of activation modes, not just \"double tap\". Star Binder lets you export to an XML file which can then be ported directly into Star Citizen using the in-game menu. You can also import a Star Citizen-compatible keybind XML. submitted by /u/Z0MGbies to r/starcitizen [link] [comments]",

I feel comfortable making the appropriate connections in the switch. My question is whether or not I need to reconfigure the switch at all to accommodate the connections. Can I wire it as is out of the box? The generator will just be used with extension cords to power what we need.

He would like to connect and analyse the store data through Google Tableau/Looker. (The info we see in the dev hub overview/analytics) My question: Is there any SDK/API integration that automatically downloads each games data (sales, add-ons sold, etc.. not in app events) and connects them to our Tableau overview? In the overview tab for each game we can't even download one .csv file for all the data, we have to go into each metric and manually download a .csv file. That can't be the only way, right ? If anyone has experience with that or knows a way around to get the games data in an external software like Google Tableau, Looker, etc.. please let me know!

Mein Hauptaugenmerk liegt auf Spieleentwicklung , aktuell vor allem mit Unity . Letztes Semester haben wir eine Extended Reality-Anwendung mit der Meta Quest 3 gebaut und mein aktueller PC (16 GB RAM) stößt dabei langsam an seine Grenzen. In Zukunft möchte ich auch mit anderen Engines wie Godot oder Unreal arbeiten und allgemein meinen Horizont im Game Dev erweitern. Nebenbei spiele ich auch gern, aber eher so Spiele wie Minecraft, Stardew Valley, Escape Simulator, Life is Strange etc... selten große AAA-Titel. Mein aktueller PC hat folgende Specs (gekauft vor ca. 4,5 Jahren): Prozessor: Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-10400F CPU @ 2.90GHz, 2904 MHz, 6 Kern(e), 12 logische(r) Prozessor(en) BaseBoard: ASRock B560 Pro4 Ram: 16GB DDR4 Grafikkarte: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Ti Netzteil: be quiet!

      "content": "I'll be blunt. My game was called Egg Farm Simulator. After a few months of development, I decided to change the name to Eggstreme Farming. Why? • There was already a mini-game on Roblox with the same name. • “Simulator” is extremely generic on Steam. • The name had no identity whatsoever. I thought changing the name would help with reach and wishlists, but it didn't help and had no relevant impact. Before the change, I was getting an average of 3–5 wishlists per day and after the change… I'm still getting 3–5 wishlists per day. Currently I have 290 wishlists. So, at least so far, the name change hasn't had a real impact on wishlists. Even so, I don't regret it. The game now has a stronger name, easier to remember, and that seems less generic. I was just curious about one thing. What do you think could be changed or improved to enhance the results on wishlists? I believe the game has the potential for better results. Currently, my marketing strategy (which I started last week) is to post videos about the development/gameplay on TikTok and YouTube shorts and post updates here on Reddit. submitted by /u/Alex4ndres [link] [comments]",

(Took two weeks. ) Did some play-testing(had around 10 playtesters) on it and the reviews were good and the feedback was all really useful. I have been refining and fixing almost all the bugs that people spotted/adding features that seemed necessary and so on. But this has not increased plays or increased retention. This iterative process has taken another 3 weeks. While I say reviews were good, none of them were truly glowing, not enough to give me confidence to continue the project. Almost no one returned for a second run by themselves. I do not want to keep working on a game that people don't genuinely enjoy. But I don't know if the polished version will be something worth it. I am very confused as to what to do. Do you guys have metrics or methods that tell you when to call it quits on a game dev project? Or is it generally solely passion driven? If you have a story as to what helped you quit a game-dev project and move on to the next one, even that would help. submitted by /u/Zorro_997 [link] [comments]",

The Devs aren’t good enough to make Vet parking functional, so the longer you have your Vet parked, the greater the chance the game will plop another Vet on top of yours, which leads to all sorts of janky game issues. This AM there were 3 Vets parked in the same spot at the nexus and all 3 players were stuck in various parts of different ships. We get it, you watched the same build guide we all did and you want to flex your new whip…just please be conscious of how long you’re validation chasing and be considerate of other players. 🫶 submitted by /u/Boring_Iron_5213 to r/NoMansSkyTheGame [link] [comments]",

The player's movement is grid based like the older SMT games, not free range. It also has to adjust based on which cardinal direction the player is facing. update_grid_position is called after the player makes a viable movement that is not blocked off, with the input action they did as the parameter. # Changes the position on the grid. func update_grid_position(action): match Facing: Direction.NORTH: #Facing North =============================== if action == \"forward\": grid_position += Vector2i.UP elif action == \"strafe_left\": grid_position += Vector2i.LEFT elif action == \"back\": grid_position += Vector2i.DOWN elif action == \"strafe_right\": grid_position += Vector2i.RIGHT Direction.WEST: #Facing West ================================ if action == \"forward\": grid_position += Vector2i.LEFT elif action == \"strafe_left\": grid_position += Vector2i.DOWN elif action == \"back\": grid_position += Vector2i.RIGHT elif action == \"strafe_right\": grid_position += Vector2i.UP Direction.SOUTH: #Facing South ================================ if action == \"forward\": grid_position += Vector2i.DOWN elif action == \"strafe_left\": grid_position += Vector2i.RIGHT elif action == \"back\": grid_position += Vector2i.UP elif action == \"strafe_right\": grid_position += Vector2i.LEFT Direction.EAST: #Facing East ================================ if action == \"forward\": grid_position += Vector2i.RIGHT elif action == \"strafe_left\": grid_position += Vector2i.UP elif action == \"back\": grid_position += Vector2i.LEFT elif action == \"strafe_right\": grid_position += Vector2i.DOWN _: pass grid_position *= -1 As you can see, the code is pretty messy at the current moment.

There are just so many different things that the show doesn't have enough time to properly cover. But a game would. Like, I'm very interested what other Vaults there are and how they're like. Maybe it could be a game where you play as a Vault dweller? Or maybe it could be set in the past, back when the NCR still existed, and tell us a story of how it came to be? Or maybe it could focus on the East Coast and the Brotherhood? Also, which studio do you think is the best for that task? It may be controversial, but in my opinion, it's Bethesda. Starfield had potential, but the setting was a total miss. Fallout, meanwhile, is more grounded, and already has plenty of established lore. But, most importantly, people at Bethesda know their open worlds, and if anyone makes a game set in the Fallout Universe, it absolutely has to be an open-world game. submitted by /u/StupidMoron1933 to r/Fallout [link] [comments]",

      "content": "As the old legend (posts from a few years ago) says, in GDScript all variables are Variant types and therefore take up 20 bytes of memory. This is required to make the language dynamically typed, or so they say. They also say that creating a statically-typed integer results in a 64-bit or 8-byte variable. This is ideal, since that's less than half the size of the Variant. However, legend has it that booleans still take up 20 bytes, whether they're statically-typed or not. Does the legend hold true to this day, or is just an old tale? submitted by /u/joseph172k [link] [comments]",

I finally finished the books but have been a fan since I played the W3 (others followed) in 2016. Fallen out of the habit hence why it took me so long. This hurt so fucking much cause I was under the impression that the games happen after the books or something. I know the games aren't exactly canon but still.

For example, all my tiles are 16x16 pixels and their colliders are the same size. However, if I have an agent with a collider that is larger than 16x16 pixels, naturally, my agent will try and pathfind through gaps it could never possibly fit through. Is there some kind of parameter or something I can change in the Agent or TileMapLayer's navigation settings that will allow for agents of varying sizes to pathfind all on the same navigation map? I apologize if the terms I'm using are not entirely accurate, I'm also happy to answer additional questions in the comments below. submitted by /u/CurlyBoyOli [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Hey everyone, I’m an indie game dev and I’ve been trying to use TikTok to share our development process, but honestly… I’m pretty confused about what actually matters there. I’ve been experimenting for a while: short dev clips, mood/edit videos, optimization stuff, using trending sounds, posting at different times, different video lengths, etc. Sometimes a video gets decent engagement, sometimes it completely dies, even when it feels similar in quality. At this point I’m not sure if I’m missing something obvious or if TikTok is just that random. So I wanted to ask people who have actually used TikTok for game dev and seen *some* results: Do hashtags really make a difference anymore? Does video length matter as much as people say? Are trending sounds actually important, or mostly irrelevant? Is posting often more important than posting “better” content? Are there things the algorithm clearly seems to favor for game dev content? If you’ve experimented with this and noticed any patterns (or mistakes to avoid), I’d really appreciate hearing about it. submitted by /u/Fit_Relative_81 [link] [comments]",

The crochet community is tight knit (had to). They don't respond well to ads or promo posts. Everything has to be organic. I'm not a developer not a marketer and honestly figuring out distribution has been harder than building the thing. By nature I'm an addict so the hustle is in me, but that's in the streets this is way different.

The \"beard\" appeared because the eyes and mouth are two different meshes (that use a flipbook to change expressions). The meshes had different normals along the cheek line and this created a distinct line in Unity. To fix it, I added a DataTransfer modifier the mouth section in Blender. It used the eye section as a source, found the closest matching vertex, and copied its normal value. When I exported the mesh back to Unity, the line disappeared.

So, given that there are a few mechs that I'm currently considering spending on, do PGI have a decent plan in place to keep the game alive for another couple of years at least?

Cons: Noticeable lag when dragging cards. VSync On, Input.use_accumulated_input = false A good compromise. Medium responsiveness, smooth movement.

      "content": "So this is my latest issue. I feel I have an understanding of creating a MetaHuman, bringing it into ZBrush and back to Unreal for rigging it up. But what I want to do now is to create my character with clothes, and gear and in doing so I'm wondering about the approach to take. when watching game models, if they wear pants and boots, the legs and feet have been deleted. I suppose it's for both performance and also penetration problems. so with MetaHuman, how would I achieve this? Do I have a Maya Master file with my rigged character and all clothes and gear rigged up. And for each outfit, I would delete the parts of the body that is covered up and export each outfit as a version like \"char_alex_supersuit\" then another like \"char_alex_pants_shirt\" etc. or do I keep everything in one file so I have a full body, then variants of this body with legs and torso deleted, maybe one with only the head depending on what outfit it goes with. then in Unreal I then hide/show these models, but I only have it all in one character. Also, when it comes to skinning (I'm using Maya) the different garments, should I just select all joints and \"Skin to Selected Joints\", then using transfer weights from MH body to my garment? submitted by /u/Dagobert_Krikelin [link] [comments]",

      "content": "I'm designing a casual, social CCG - it's not 'MtG with a twist' but for the sake of clarity, imagine you're playing MtG. But you don't have any creatures in your deck. Instead, you have a side deck of creatures who are Neutral in terms of control and only proc based on conditions or played cards - each round you draw one and place it face up into a queue for the battlefield with a max of 3 cards, after which the queue is full and no more can be drawn. Active creature cards in play are in the 'battlefield', which will damage/heal players or induce effects depending on whether their Element/Attribute/Cost is referenced. Creatures leave the battlefield depending on a round timer, and if they leave on a player's turn the player can select a Queue card for the Battlefield. The Queue isn't necessary but adds some choice and anticipation/strategy opportunity. Now instead of creatures, imagine they're philosophers, tyrants, literary figures and they're all there to criticise your logic and heckle or execute you. Does this sound fun? Because it seems like one of the really fun things about games like this is getting a card in your hand , and then playing it with excruciating smugness . This format loses that particular element of fun and I don't know if the alternative format is actually interesting in terms of new opportunities or strategies - it just seems like ceding control/decision making but perhaps this is why it's imagined as a more casual game. submitted by /u/Planar_Harold [link] [comments]",

It's very difficult to build on top of what I have but it's primarily because of my experience level of coding when I started. I want to hop into a 2D/3D venture as well. What do you guys think?

And that reminded me: I myself have a birthmark in the shape of a butterfly, and that inspired me to make some sort of Desnan emissary for my next character. I'm not sure whether I want to play a nephilim character or not, since I think a versatile heritage is just more fun to play in an Ancestry Paragon game, and that ruleset hasn't been brought up to the remaster, so I'd like to know if there's any further lore about birthmarks and what they mean/how they're interpreted in the world of Golarion. Just hoping to get some more character concept inspiration and to learn some new lore. Thx :) submitted by /u/DarkMoon250 to r/Pathfinder_RPG [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Hello everyone, new aspiring VTuber here. I have a question for both viewers and creators in this community: How do I align model to my personality as a VTuber? And how much does it really matter? I feel like it's partially something you figure out as you stream/create videos as a VTuber, but at the same time, wouldn't rebranding feel confusing to the viewer? I had an idea for my vtuber design long before I tried streaming for the first time, but I'm a little bit hesitant now. VTubers, have you ever been unsure about what kind of model (or better say character) would work best for you at the beginning of your path? Viewers, have you experienced a VTuber you watch go through a rebranding and if yes, how did you feel about it? Let me know your thoughts, please 🙏 I'm gonna attach my character design and tell a bit about myself, and you can be the judge of whether the design is fitting: Hi, I'm CyberTiger, I also go by Cyberchuff 🐯⚠️ I make videos irl and recently started streaming as a VTuber. I'd say most of what I do sits somewhere between creativity and tech: I like filming, editing, drawing and experimenting with all sorts of stuff. I tried making music a while ago and now I'm on my path of learning programming, where I have a few goals: 1. Create a RPG Maker game like Omori; 2. Create my personal Al assistant that would run locally on my pc (think of Chihiro's Alter Ego from Danganronpa: THH) I like trying things I've never done before just cuz I get bored of what I did before and to challenge myself with some ✨️new shiny activity✨️ I'm also an ENTP on a more introverted side of a spectrum if you're familiar with 16 personalities. Moral alignment irl: Chaotic Neutral, although I tend to get all deep and philosophical on streams for no fucking reason. Favorite emojis: 😎, 👁👄👁, 👀, ☝️🤓, 🤡, 🤔, 🫠, 🗿. Another important thing I probably should mention is what king of streams I want to do. As it is for right now, I'm streaming my design drawing process, but I'd also want to try streaming some programming and games. First in line are Project Zomboid, Omori, and Baldurs Gate 3 (if my pc will survive it), maybe some dbd with viewers, friends, viewers and friends, viewers who are friends etc etc. For now I'm just figuring a lot of stuff out, and I'm so small there's noone to notice if I'm to change stuff.

I still have a lot to learn, but now that I can look back, I'm pretty proud of the progress I've made! If you put in the time, it's definitely possible to improve at art! Now our game is ready for release, and I recently completed the last iteration of it. What do you think? submitted by /u/HolograpicQuad [link] [comments]",

I released my hobby project Bricks Breaker RPG with no previous dev experience. It's been a life-changing and I never in a million years thought that a hobby could end up this way after such a short time. It took me 18 months to code the game and I managed to finally release it on Android and iOS a few months ago. The Android release grossed $11,165.00 in the first month and iOS Grossed $2,765.00 I have a couple of videos that I can share with you if you ask that talk a little about the individual releases. The TLDR is that I didn't promote the game outside of Reddit really, I tried a few ads here and there but ultimately they were a waste of money. I wish there was a secret formula to success launches but I honestly think if the game/app is good enough, that's most of the hard work done.

What makes a game enjoyable to watch is seeing the teams go back and forth for 60 minutes (or a bit extra with OT). Watching a team get blown out is no fun. This is double as true with many “big comebacks”. Patriots fans or fans in general had to watch the Falcons blow them out for 30 minutes. Falcons fans had to watch them get blown out for 30 minutes. There was no tension between back and forth scoring with a close game where each score where the teams are on a tight rope constantly pulling the rope under their opponent. Also this only just highlighted how terrible the OT rules were, making the end only as tragic. MVP had to sit and watch their defense lose.

      "content": "Hi, I'm creating an Asteroids game in Godot and I wanted to recreate the highscore the arcade machines had, in which you enter 3 letters representing your name and your highscore gets saved. I wanted to replicate that in the game so I create a LineEdit Node and give it code to restrict his output. I give it a max_lenght of 3 so it only shows 3 letters. The thing is that I want that the only valid characters the user can write are letters (and maybe numbers) so I searched how can i do that and I found about the RegEx class and after a time looking what it does, I write this code on the _on_text_changed method. The code is from other people that had the same problem as me. Howewer, I had two big problems with this: - The first one is that the code doesn't work. It's supossed to look into the text and check if all the letters fit the pattern of the const ALLOWED_CHARACTERS. But for some reason it does not do it at all. - The second problem is that for some reason sometimes when I run the scene, my screen freezes and does not let me do anything. It's weird because sometimes does not happen but also sometimes does so its a bit weird. While I was writing this I thought that maybe in this case the problem is inside the _on_text_change_rejected. The point of that is to replicate the behaviour of the arcade machines, when if you put a fourth letter when you have already wrote three of them (for example: \"ABC\"), it pushes the two last letters to the left and adds the new one to the right (In this example, \"ABC\" transforms into \"BCD\" in the case I pressed the \"D\" keyword). My point is that maybe because the method is changing the text, it can change the behaviour of the _on_text_changed method, but i'm not sure. That's why I ask for help, can you tell me what exactly the problem in my code? I would aprecciate any help. submitted by /u/anchoasada [link] [comments]",

      "content": "I made a plugin (with the help of chat gpt) to add a confetti effect on rpg maker MZ And as it works well (I didn't notice any bug but it's not impossible that there are some) I wanted to share it. You can find it on this page https://www.rpg-maker.fr/scripts-587-confettis-sur-la-map.html (the article is in french but the plugin is in english) It's not very hard to use (translation of the article) : Just put your confetti images in /img/pictures, enable the plugin, then go to: \"Plugin Command\" → Confetti.js → play and set your parameters: Images → the names of your confetti images, separated by commas, for example: Confetti1, Confetti2 X → the position at the top of the screen where you want your confetti to appear. Example: 0 for the top left, or 408 for the center if your screen width is 816px. Spawn Width (top) → the width at the top of the screen where the confetti will spawn. Example: if your screen is 816px wide, setting 816 will launch confetti across the full width of the screen. Bottom Spread → the width of the confetti spread at the bottom. Example: if your screen is 816px wide, setting 816 will spread the confetti across the full width. Amount → the number of confetti pieces. The higher the number, the more confetti you get (be careful — above 50 starts to get heavy; between 1 and 10 is good). Duration → how long the confetti is emitted, for example 60 for 60 frames (1 second). Exemple the settings in the gif are : X → 480 (my game's window is 960 px wide) Spawn Width (top) → 24 Bottom Spread → 480 Amount → 2 Duration → 90 That’s it!

There are games with good graphics that are well optimized both for mobile and PC. In version 2.0 the game was perfect; you implemented the shader (which is good), but I don’t think it should be difficult to improve optimization if you assign a team to each task. It’s a good game, but I feel that if they don’t fix all these issues, it will gradually have fewer players.

      "title": "Presenting y'all Stack Order: our narrative roguelite deckbuilder",
      "content": "Hi, this is our first post here! We are a small indie team of two. We have been working on a project called Stack Order, and since we just launched our Steam page, we wanted to share the design philosophy behind it to see if it can interest anyone! We wanted to bring back the feeling of physicality found in TCGs like magic or yu-gi-oh where the order in which cards resolve is a puzzle in itself. In Stack Order, you don't just play cards into a void. You have distinct slots (Attack, Defense, Special) where you physically pile up your cards. When you activate a stack, cards resolve from the top down. This means a card placed at the top happens before a card placed at the bottom. Example: If you place a \"Wound\" card after an Attack card, it’s useless because the attack resolves first and won't be amplified by the wound. You have to physically place the Wound card on top of the Attack for the combo to work when you will trigger all the cards from top to bottom. Also, the Bosses you face explicitly telegraphs their intent (for example: Will deal 10 special damages), so your turn isn't just about playing your strongest cards but it's about building a clever stacks that will have a use in 2/3 turns when you'll need an answer. We are also huge fans of graphic novels, so we are animating the entire game by hand (2D animation) to make the game feel like a living comic book. If this sounds like your kind of jam, checking out the Steam page helps us a lot! Steam Link: https://store.steampowered.com/app/4338750/Stack_Order/ We would also be very happy to answer any questions you may have about the game or discuss it with you!

      "content": "Credit to u/ZealousidealPlay3183 for finding this. As many of you know, Jeffrey Epstein played videogames. He got banned from Xbox Live due to harassment and he discussed about COD and micro transactions with important figures on activision. However, there is a compelling theory that he played Fortnite and his account username was 'littlestjeff1', same as his youtube account (referencing the dreadful island which he nicknamed 'Little St Jeff'). I've watched a few Instagram reels discussing this and ~1 hour ago I decided to take a look. The account appeared to have changed its flag to the Israeli flag (I took the screenshot to send to my friend. Might have been one of the luckiest things I did as the account is now private on fortnite tracker). The account did show some hours of gameplay back in Chapter 1 Season 3, which must mean it was created as early as April 2018. More importantly, it did show gameplay in several recent seasons (2023 and 2024). From my point of view, this must mean one of three things: Someone created this account with this username back in 2018, but it's simply a coincidence and it comes down to chance. Jeffrey Epstein created this account and has been using it recently, meaning he is alive Jeffrey Epstein created this account, but he has not had access to it since his last arrest. If someone is using it, it's someone with access to the account (maybe a hacker or someone with access to the console he used to play or his Epic Games account). Out of the 3, I feel like 2 is the most convincing one. Still don't know what to make of the Israeli flag on his profile submitted by /u/RocketsDitto to r/Epstein [link] [comments]",

The issue didn't go away. I've tried half a dozen surfaces, and the only one that worked was using the back on my tablet's case (way too small to use as a pad) I've tried updating firmware, resetting the mouse, cleaning the sensor, etc. It still won't work well. I use it for competetive fps games, mostly, but sometimes I can't make microadjustments as a result. Should I try a different mousepad or try contacting asus or try a different software? I use armory crate gear and ghelper, and I've tried calibrating the pad. Still, no dice. submitted by /u/WhyIGottaNameMyself to r/MouseReview [link] [comments]",

Its a multiplayer game so I know I will need to rewrite how messages are sent to use websockets, but what other kinds of stuff could be different? I don't want to go through the work of making it a web build if there will be problems down the road that I don't know about. The only major thing I have noticed is that the lighting changes. submitted by /u/CorvaNocta [link] [comments]",

In terms of concept art and drawings its fine but how do I physically blockout a level? Do i do it all in blender? CSG in godot4? What practices should I be using to block out things like slopes or cliffs etc. The problem with most tutorials i've watched is they alwsys talk about \"make corridors that direct thr player\" but with the design I am hoping to do is something more open like fields or beaches or somehing like that Any guidance would be appreciated. submitted by /u/RamuneGaming to r/leveldesign [link] [comments]",

I was already thinking of swapping my RX 9060 XT 16GB to 5060 Ti 16GB but the price difference... But then I found out the reason it stuttered so much was because of SmartZoi. Right after I turned it off, the lag went away. A bit disappointing though, I really like the feature, it made me enjoy the game more.

      "content": "I’m in 10th grade, and have zero friends. I’ve been growing up with the same kids for years and yet I’m not friends with any of them. Bask in elementary I had so many friends, went to their house, played games, had a nice group of friends at school, and I had pretty much all my friends since elementary since one by one we all started slipping apart. A lot of the friend groups I once had we strayed away because of covid. We were school friends but didn’t have each others number, so that’s definitely why. In 5th and 6th, I still had a few good friend, and still had one friend I would consider my best friend and he would say it too. We would play games almost every night. But then 8th grade came and we got no classes toghether. We still talked but he started losing interest in games, and his parents never let him stay over at my house or his some reason. In 8th grade it was the first grade where I genuinely felt completely alone. I didn’t make any friends, every single grade before this I could recall at least 1 friend I made, but this was the first time it wasn’t. And my best friend had way more important things in life that got in the way of playing games so we strayed apart. All of my friends from elementary, who moved away but I still had their numbers, also strayed away around this time, and especially one, who was my best friend from when I was 8, we kinda just stopped talking. Every time I go to him he’s always playing with his own friend and I can never join. He always seems to have some excuse to not playing and I text him first every time. 10th grade and I’m even more isolated. I join a few clubs but I’m sitting in the corner, seeing everyone have somewhere by their side or someone that follows them, and I have no one. I see new kids that transfers schools get so many friends, so I have realized that it is 100% me. I can’t have 1 interaction where in sweating afterward. I struggle to say “hi” to someone. And I go to people in my schools TikTok’s and they have so many friends. I hace zero. One “friend” I went to his house and he was very dry. When I opened the door he didn’t even say hi or smile or anything he literally just looked at me and then walked away, and he clearly didnt want me to be there. I tried starting any conversations but he answered dryly. Every time I try to spark a conversation with him in class he gives usually a dry answer, and if I say nothing to him in class, he doesn’t either. And now it’s even worse he literally acts as if I don’t exist, and then I see him messing and joking and rough housing with his other friends. Same goes for every single other friend. What am I doing wrong??? Not one person ever texts me first ever since this year. What am I doing wrong and I just want friends like genuinely I almost cried at my club bc I was sitting while everyone else was socializing and I was too scared to say anything bc they’re gonna be like “omg that kid talked omg omg” and I know it. Literally 1 best friend at school just 1 is all I want. I know a group of kids who seem nice and I think I want to be friends with them, especially one guy because he’s been nice to me before. But I’m too scared and he’s not following me online. How do I get over social anxiety it’s ruining my life submitted by /u/Fickle-Work-1225 to r/school [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Well... What doesn't kill us, make us stronger, right? I am not sure anymore. There is an aspect of developing a thick skin that seems quite disturbing. On one side of the phenomenon, I feel more prepared to deal with life in many different levels of intensity and danger, but on the other side, if the world is too dangerous to be exactly the way I was born, why would I want to be here? My experiences have been so unnecessarily heavy, that I gets to a point that I don't know if I have the capacity to enjoy pure beauty as it is. Almost like... I'll never see light as it is, but all the shadow casted in the corners as well. Personally, there is some weight to this perspective that just blur my own capacity to experience good. The sunset is still beautiful, nature is still majestic, adrenaline is still fuel, but how could I experiences those moments without the weight of my own life? I keep trying though... trying to experience just the good... but this might not be for me and I should embrace this process. Perhaps that's what I am supposed to offer to the next generation (my own family), a life where good is actually good, not just unrealized potential. Because I feel like all the good I see, is just brute potential, not reality. And there are no safe places around me, that holds space for genuine expression of good. I guess I am doomed to perceiving life with the same eyes that saw all the terror I met. Perhaps my children will live free of this nightmare... I could set this as my dream and feel satisfied, while also finding purpose in my experiences 🙏🏼 submitted by /u/DisruptorMor to r/spirituality [link] [comments]",

I don't like to post unless I have something good to share, and I think this time is a really good one! Long story short, I've added random events to the game, which I think add a lot of depth to the core game loop. The video attached shows most of them, the black hole, cargo drone, and crust swarm (which is less a random event and more adjacent to random events) however there is one more where pirate drones attack and siphon your resources and disable your drones if you don't take them out. I've also made some balance updates to the mining drones, as well as how scanning works. This game has come a long way since I've first posted and has even more to go. Take a look at the Dev Log if you're interested in more of what I did this update or in any previous updates! And come play the game if you haven't already. It's for web, playable on desktop and mobile. I'm looking to do a Steam release in the future, more info on that outlined on my Discord! As always, thank you all for playing and for your feedback! submitted by /u/Disamble [link] [comments]",

Recently started streaming around December and was wondering how my stats are doing! Very new to making any content. I draw all my art and play games with my friends lol. . Ive set up and am doing everything on my own. Also like how do you guys come up with good topic points and conversation flow with chat? I kinda just go off the top of my head but i kinda want like things i can fall back on to talk about forever, i make a lot of raunchy jokes as im an 18 plus stream. Also like to do lil silly voices and just being my lil bean self. Im getting a little overwhelmed on what to focus on or what things i should be moving toward next to better my streams.

      "content": "This is your sign to get a vr treadmill, especially if you’ve been watching reviews and YouTube demos but never pulling the trigger. I’ve been there 😅. I mostly play Skyrim VR, and mods are a big part of how I play. And once I added movement mods, combat tweaks, and expanded landscapes, joystick movement started feeling limiting. Physically walking, even in short steps, made exploration slower, more intentional, and way more immersive. It felt like actually being inside the world instead of just steering a character. Beyond immersion, the treadmill is a surprisingly good workout. You’re constantly moving your legs, balancing, and shifting weight, which adds up over a few hours. The Kat Walk C2 works well for me because it folds up easily and feels solid enough for long sessions. The harness spreads weight evenly, and noise and calibration make a huge difference. After tweaking it for my space, turning and strafing feel natural, and I can move safely without worrying about bumping into furniture. Before buying, I compared Amazon, eBay, direct brand sites, and even skimmed Alibaba just to see how different designs hold up. If you already care about immersion or want a fun way to add low-impact cardio, a vr treadmill closes the gap between gaming and exercise. Who else has tried one at home? submitted by /u/Ok-Independence5246 to r/homefitness [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Hey Salesforce devs! 👋 Have you checked out the latest Spring ’26 release? It’s pretty exciting—now you can perform GraphQL mutations right inside your Lightning Web Components using the executeMutation function from lightning/graphql . I used to juggle between GraphQL reads and update/delete through Apex or lightning/uiRecordApi , which sometimes felt like keeping data flows out of sync. But now, with Spring ’26, it’s possible to keep all CRUD operations in one neat GraphQL flow! The exampleLWC pattern in particular shows how you can load accounts, edit inline, create, update, or delete records—and keep your UI refreshed consistently from the same source of truth. This means less code complexity and improved data accuracy, especially for apps relying heavily on reactive data and rich UI summaries. If you're building Salesforce apps with LWC and GraphQL, this could be a game changer for managing data reactively and imperatively. Has anyone tried this out in their projects yet? What’s your take on unifying read/write GraphQL flows like this?

The game is called JINNI 2: The Ritual , and it’s a horror experience rooted in Anatolian folklore. One of the features I’ve been working hardest on is a microphone system where the entities in the game actually react to the sounds and voices you make in real life. It adds a whole new layer of tension when you realize they can actually \"hear\" you. I’d love to get some feedback from fellow devs or horror fans. If you have some time to check it out and let me know what you think about the atmosphere or the mechanics, it would mean the world to me. Thanks for letting me share this milestone with you guys! submitted by /u/danikcara to r/IndieGaming [link] [comments]",

Well, after 300 hours it became evident that max 300 made mid to late game lose all tension. Nothing was a threat anymore in the wild on land short of a wild Giga or carcha. You simply were too higher leveled. And for some reason making wild creatures higher level makes loot way way better. Why? Idk. But all I ever found is Mastercraft and ascendant gear and saddles. The world could no longer push back. Also, Ragnarok seems very unbalanced. That ice cave in particular is so broken: allowing flyers to go in to easy high tier loot over and over.

All the tutorials put the player control script in their player node. This doesn't make any problems when the project is a tiny tutorial. But now I'm thinking about what'll happen once I have multiple elements that will take in inputs. For example a UI element that uses arrow keys. That would use the same inputs as my player, so it would have to override the controls. My first thought was that it could make sense to have some sort of central script that handles all controls and inputs. Although I'm guessing that's not an optimal solution, because of modularity or some shit. I think the solution is to just write the scripts so that any element that needs to override the controls does that by itself. So for example if you open a menu, that UI scene is loaded and it has a script that stops the player controls from working while the menu is open. How is this stuff usually done? I get stuck thinking about this kind of stuff at every step of development. I probably should just make the game and not stop at every step. I'll post this anyway.

He weighed 731 pounds, served as a town marshal without a gun, and once shoved a burning safe to safety with his bare hands. But in Farmersville, Texas, they remember Sam Harris for one thing above all: his heart. In the early 1900s, Sam Harris wasn’t a spectacle. He wasn’t a sideshow attraction; he was simply Big Sam , the gentle giant of Farmersville. Despite his enormous size, his legacy wasn’t built on his strength but on his kindness and quiet presence. After surviving typhoid fever as a boy, Sam grew into a man who could have easily been isolated, but instead, he rooted himself in his community. As town marshal, he kept the peace not by force, but by being a steady, calming presence. When a local business caught fire, Sam, without hesitation, walked into the flames and pushed a 2,000-pound safe to safety with his bare hands. Sam’s life wasn’t marked by his size, but by the way he made others feel. He traveled through town in a custom buggy pulled by two white mules, always tipping his hat to neighbors. On summer days, he would float in the river, and his children would use his chest as a diving platform. Despite his fame—he was a fixture in parades, a member of fraternal orders, and even featured in Ripley’s Believe It or Not! —at home, he was simply “Big Sam.” A devoted father and a man made mostly of heart. When he died in 1931, thousands gathered to honor him. A custom-built casket was carried on a flatbed truck through town, and mourners followed not to gawk, but to mourn a friend. Sam’s grave in Farmersville Cemetery serves as a reminder that true greatness isn’t measured in pounds or feats of strength. It’s in the quiet moments of grace, the kindness that outlasts the legends, and the way we make space for others in our lives. His legacy, carved not in stone but in the hearts of those who knew him, teaches us that the largest legacy isn’t written in stature—it’s written in the weight of our character. •Please pray for those who dedicate their lives to helping• “Whoever pursues righteousness and love finds life, prosperity and honor.” Proverbs 21:21.

The character scale is correct, the scale of the sword is also correct. edit: In blender my units are set to meter. unless if that is the problem. though, I had exported unreal's mannequine into blender to keep the size in check. unless Blender's 1 meter somehow unreal turned it into 100 meters!!! submitted by /u/sanketvaria29 [link] [comments]",

      "content": "(Do people even read these??) I had these 4 in minds : New camera mechanics - Both spectating and only getting to view the back of ur bot is getting kinda old..Pixo needs to add camera angles and such. We also need the most obvious thing.... FREE CAM. Some people get creative when it comes to freecam, doing some sick edits/gameplay with it. It would be amazing if they added these things. They should also make the UI invisible when we are in free cam and in different angle (or they could have a setting specialised for it) Dgems to Resource - When it comes to dgems, some people spend them and then somehow get left with 10 or less of these precious digital cubes. The idea is, when players have 10 or LESS dgems, they can convert them to resources, such as silvers,golds,modules and so on. These would make those un-spendable dgems come to hands.. Specialisation - I know this might sound useless, but this gives an advantage to SOME peoples....Anywho, The ability to ENABLE/DISABLE specialisation is quite handy when it comes to testing and other *stuff* ADS - I know it, you know it, we ALL know it..The ads are quite, sad..Fake gameplays, some *questionable* ones and as such. The ads NEEDS to be FIXED, that's when free cam stuff comes in handy...The pictures in Google Play also needs to be replaced with TRUE gameplays.. Converting Special Editions to normal versions (this would never make it to the game as it is kinda bs) - Some people (js SOME people) ​prefer design over damage (like ME). They should make it so we can obviously convert Special editions to normal versions with a cost of golds or silvers?. This wont do any advantage besides having lesser damages... I hope pixo reads dis (ofc not) especially for the specialisation and camera mechanics things. Thanks for reading and lmk what would be the disadvantages of one of these ideas :D submitted by /u/Frryx to r/walkingwarrobots [link] [comments]",

      "content": "1. I suggest resetting the PK count and Arena Rating (AR) on a monthly basis in order to encourage players to keep participating in PvP, instead of benefiting from a high rating and then avoiding fights to prevent losing it. For a more motivating experience, it would be great to add an in-game menu that displays these rankings, with sorting options by class, while still keeping a Top 50 players leaderboard. I believe this system could help create new legends within the game, similar to what we used to see in classic MMORPGs, where competition and reputation truly mattered. 2. I hope the dev considers adding a new PvP mode with a large-scale, team-based focus. Once every hour, players could enter a war zone through a portal and be randomly assigned to one of two teams, with no player limit per side. Each team would defend its own boss while trying to defeat the enemy team’s boss first. This kind of mode could be a great addition for endgame players, especially for those who find traditional dungeons too repetitive (myself included). It would offer a fresh, dynamic alternative that encourages coordination, large battles, and replayability. Wars can last for 30 minutes, every hour. If there would be many players in each team (no level restriction or player number restriction), maybe would be better that mages and rangers can have AOEs in this PvP mode 🤔. Clerics will heal and shield etc., while paladins can make engages, through their spell when they run to enemy and stun it. I think that would be a cool implementation, and not very difficult to code, and a good reason to make people stay in the game and chill as endgamers. submitted by /u/HourNeedleworker688 to r/Dreadmyst [link] [comments]",

Easiest comparison is to the recoiless rifle which has 6 total ammo while the breaching hammer has 8 charges. The breaching hammer one taps most things with some exceptions like factory striders and hive lords lol. The breaching hammer also doesnt require a backpack If you look at just the values than yeah the breachinh hammer is extremely good But I dont think some people realise how tricky using melee weapons in this game is. Not only can you not kill flying enemies you also have to come close to an enemy which is usualy pretty risky. Dont get me wrong I am not saying that the breaching hammer is bad. It is really good especialy for a melee weapon in this game. I just think some people overhype it making it seem like it is extremely overpowered. Some even already say that the hammer is going to get nerfed which is just wild. In my opinon it is such a well rounded good melee weapon submitted by /u/StatisticianIll4 to r/Helldivers [link] [comments]",

      "content": "I am working on a mobile game and digging deeper into performance decisions, especially around real-time shadows. I always assumed shadows were a “must-have” for visual grounding. But as we’ve started profiling on actual devices, it’s become pretty clear how expensive shadows are on mobile, especially with skinned characters and anything targeting stable 60 FPS. I have also just learned more about how common auto-tuning / device-tiering actually is (auto-detecting hardware and applying different quality tiers at runtime). That got me thinking differently about the problem. So I’m curious how senior / experienced mobile devs approach this today: -Do you consider real-time shadows necessary on mobile? -Or are shadows more of a luxury feature that should be reserved for higher-tier devices only? -Is it reasonable to completely disable shadows on low- and mid-tier devices, and only enable them (at modest quality) on mid-to-high / flagship devices? Right now I’m leaning toward -Low tier: no shadows -Mid tier: no shadows -High tier: medium-quality environment shadows only Gameplay readability and performance stability matter more to me than visual fidelity, but I don’t want to make the game feel flat if shadows are considered important. Would love to hear how others are handling this in real production. Especially what players actually notice vs. what we think they notice. submitted by /u/build_logic [link] [comments]",

But then it stroke us. Maybe we were too focused on the game development itself. Making the interactions perfect. Making the animations perfect. Making everything perfect inside a project that doesn't have any audience. I guess we could call it a rookie mistake. Now we know wishlists won't come out of nowhere. Especially not while the game is only presented through pictures and a video. Previously, our branding was based on a \"1-hour job\" with the goal \"Just get it out there\". Didn't work. Therefore, now we started looking into re-branding of, what we believe, is a great game with a lot of potential. Before Branded as a detective horror game. You play as a detective that has to uncover the truth. After Branded as a full on horror game with a side quest as a detective. Go out there with your friends. Scream on a Discord call. Explore the ever-changing maps. Your detective lobby is just a funny place with Easter Eggs. Throw toilet paper and beer bottles at your friends. Then move to search the scary locations.

      "content": "I am working on a mobile game and digging deeper into performance decisions, especially around real-time shadows. I always assumed shadows were a “must-have” for visual grounding. But as we’ve started profiling on actual devices, it’s become pretty clear how expensive shadows are on mobile, especially with skinned characters and anything targeting stable 60 FPS. I have also just learned more about how common auto-tuning / device-tiering actually is (auto-detecting hardware and applying different quality tiers at runtime). That got me thinking differently about the problem. So I’m curious how senior / experienced mobile devs approach this today: -Do you consider real-time shadows necessary on mobile? -Or are shadows more of a luxury feature that should be reserved for higher-tier devices only? -Is it reasonable to completely disable shadows on low- and mid-tier devices, and only enable them (at modest quality) on mid-to-high / flagship devices? Right now I’m leaning toward -Low tier: no shadows -Mid tier: no shadows -High tier: medium-quality environment shadows only Gameplay readability and performance stability matter more to me than visual fidelity, but I don’t want to make the game feel flat if shadows are considered important. Would love to hear how others are handling this in real production. Especially what players actually notice vs. what we think they notice. submitted by /u/build_logic [link] [comments]",

There are no damage previews, so it's hard to make a informed decision about what to do. Units are extremely slow, mission objectives are far away, and there is very little cover to move between. You don't get anything for saving your action points either. There's no overwatch mechanic or bonus AP on the next turn, so if I don't move them to the full extent of their ability, it kinda feels like a waste. The basic infantry guns barely even tickle the enemy. They just feel bad to use. Maybe it focuses more on \"realism\" but I think in general I prefer more arcade style strategy games like XCOM or Into the Breach. submitted by /u/Openly_Gamer to r/StrategyRpg [link] [comments]",

The apple doesnt fall far from the tree with me. I dont know. I am on new medication now so im not waking up crying and wanting to die. I dont know if these meds are just making me a tiny bit high but I feel amazing just having horrible sleep. Does anyone else feel tired during the day on their meds? I never took naps in my life but I started to recently. I dont know if its because the meds im on are just horse tranquilizers or what.

In the version I'm building, I've integrated an API that pulls official F1 data (like the stuff you see in the video) to help decide on Race Partners (sponsors picked but change every). For example, instead of just picking a sponsor and hoping for the best, the game has a \"Data Centre\" where you can: Compare Driver Telemetry: See side-by-side speed traces for two drivers to see who actually has the better pace vs the top 10 and 11th-15th. Track Tyre Age/Compounds: View exactly how many laps your driver’s current set has done. Targeted Payouts: Use this data to choose specific \"Race Partners\" like the Apex Double Top 10: Pays if both your drivers finish in the points . https://preview.redd.it/p4jcb6mq1yhg1.png?width=1150&format=png&auto=webp&s=8893b27e30fd87f77056b8bd1bc3fec86e270e69 The idea is to move away from \"set and forget\" teams and actually use the Friday/Saturday data to \"lock in\" your sponsorship strategy for Sunday. Does this level of depth appeal to you as a fantasy player, or do you prefer the more casual approach of the official app?

Should I be... scaling up each sprite node 6x in godot so that the game is built at 1920x1080. build the game pixel-perfect and let the window size scale it? building the game at pixel-perfect scale, then scaling up the entire game in a subviewport node? build the game at the native 1920x1080 size and just saving out all the sprites and graphics at 6x Or something else? I'm finding that if I make the game at pixel perfect scale, I can sometimes see flashes of gaps between graphics when scaled up, unless I check the pixel \"snap\" options in my project settings. However, this leads to slower animations looking jagged and star-steppy. I'm kinda leaning toward just saving my graphics at 6x to avoid these issues. And that will also give me the option to render things at higher resolution as-needed, like fonts. submitted by /u/dylanmadigan [link] [comments]",

It’s a desktop app that translates any text on your screen , even when the text isn’t selectable — like: text inside images YouTube videos game dialogue or error messages foreign-language UI elements I kept running into this problem myself and got tired of manually typing things out or using phone-based OCR, so I decided to build a proper desktop solution. How it works: You press a hotkey Select an area of the screen OCR extracts the text The translation appears instantly in a floating, glass-style overlay The app is built in Python , uses OCR under the hood, and focuses on staying lightweight and unobtrusive while you’re working or gaming. Demo video (1 min): https://youtu.be/YRHfRc4_d3s Source code: https://github.com/Samar-365/lingo_live This is still a work in progress, and I’m actively improving it, so I’d really appreciate: feature suggestions UX feedback ideas for real-world use cases Happy to answer any questions about the implementation as well.

I got mine in 2024 and it's the only counsel I use outside of PC or android, but ppl say it's out dated and we are never getting modern games or even a fallout 4 port since everything is on switch 2 now, are there still good games on this device that run smooth without lower graphics and is the switch lite good enough without having to mod or hack it!? I don't have the money to mod my switch so it's as is, but I do have the Hyrule Zelda edition of it which is nice and a good sizeable game library, most games run fine but so we do have lower graphics...

I’ve already tried a few times, but it usually ends with either FPS drops or the game crashing. I’m not using a huge mod list — around 20 to maybe 30 mods at most. The problem is, I don’t really understand load order on console, which mods overwrite others, or which combinations can cause issues. There are also a few mods that always move themselves to the top of the load order no matter what I do, even after saving, which makes it even more confusing. Below is the list of mods I’d like to use. I’m not sure if they work well together, if some of them conflict, or how I should order them properly on PS5. I’m not really looking to add more mods — I just want these to work as stable as possible.

      "content": "First thing I think could do some work is the new player experience. Besides the tutorial being too basic, the squad leader selection could definitely make for some improvement. I think you should HAVE to pick one pilot and three infantry leaders to start, and everyone should start out with max squadies, and equipped with the starter equipment Especially the car and it's gun. That might put you over the cap depending on the crew you take, but simply make it so the cap is at the max a new player could possibly have. Aside from that is the decision on what leaders to take specifically. Aside from the lore blurb, an assessment summarizing the strengths of the leader and how they can develop would be great. Mousing over all the badges is not intuitive and also too time consuming for someone who doesn't really know the game yet. It might even be better to take the choice away from players at first and stick them with four specific leaders rather than give new players decision paralysis right at the start. submitted by /u/Corka to r/menace [link] [comments]",

Right now, I’m at 987 units on Steam . Just 13 away from that first 1,000 milestone! What’s even more encouraging is seeing a 27-minute median playtime on the demo. Knowing that people are actually staying in the world I built by myself for that long is honestly the best fuel to keep going. Those small victories make all the sleepless nights worth it.

His abilities can refer to his canon ability to defecate endless amounts of power and also his planet Eternium. His abilities would be really cute but most importantly, he would be Nibbler. This would also impact the lore because Nibbler is omniscient and knows how every ritual will end. He sees in an alternate universe that the opposing patron's court would destroy the world with their newfound power and status, and that's why he is fighting. Also everyone else on the team is surprised that Nibbler can talk because they all knew each other and were friends before because of course. Nibbler is cute. Who wouldn't want to be friends with him? But after the game, they all forget he can talk and have their memory of the ritual wiped. Anyway this is my headcanon. In my mind Nibbler is canon in Deadlock and everyone likes him. submitted by /u/Extension_Bus_9926 to r/DeadlockTheGame [link] [comments]",

First match I spawn in Eerie with The Ghoul. Ghoul appears to be decently new, but he does understand gen pressure and when to drop chase. They left me multiple times when I led them away from gens. After about 14 minutes we lose a teammate before the last gen can pop, but we keep rotating 2/3 of the last gen. After a while the three of us get out. Then as I'm typing out \"GG\" this lovely message comes up right before I hit enter. I don't know any of these people here, and none of this is even close to genrush. You can even tell by the point distribution that genrushing wasn't happening here as then the points would be in the teens or less for basically everyone. I'm hoping they learn more about the game and also switch up their build to better counter what they consider to be gen rushing. submitted by /u/luigind123 to r/DeadByDaylightRAGE [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Valve's upcoming Steam Machine faces significant delays and unexpected price increases due to soaring RAM and storage component costs, forcing the company to revisit its schedule and pricing. Analysts predict the 512GB model could now start at $700-1000, with the 2TB version potentially hitting $1300-$1500, far exceeding initial targets. Experts warn that a price exceeding $700 could be a \"death sentence\" for sales, as Valve, unlike larger console makers, lacks the negotiating power to absorb these rising costs. This pricing challenge primarily threatens the Steam Machine's ability to expand its user base beyond its established PC enthusiast audience.

You could go into the settings and have blueprint share/transfer on or off. Choose what save to share from or have them all share. When in the blueprint section it is in a folder labeled from the save name or a name chosen by you (like how you can edit the folders already). from. And if you make the blueprints in a higher level blueprint maker they are locked until you unlock that level (if possible the game could measure how big the blueprint is if made in a mk2 or higher blueprint maker. And if it’s small enough to fit in a mk1 it’s unlocked before mk2 unlock.) I am just putting it out there so that the devs may see this and make it an official feature. Please upvote to support and comment any ideas with blueprint sharing. Or other discussions in the comments.

We had trouble with the old motherboard, and bought a brand new one factory sealed. But when we turn the PC on, the lights/fans/RGB turn on, but the DRAM light is a solid yellow , and stays on for at least 5 minutes. We have a ROG STRIX B550-F GAMING WIFI II and a Ryzen 9 5900X , with 32GB of DDR4 3600, in a Lian Li Vector V100R (including the case for reason below). This is everything I've tried so far: Tried reseating each stick of RAM, in each slot/configuration Tried with a confirmed working stick of RAM in each slot Checked the CPU for damaged/missing pins, or excess thermal paste in the socket Reseated the motherboard/CPU power cables, and checked the PSU connections Replaced the CMOS battery with a brand new and confirmed working CMOS battery Updated BIOS using the flashback feature on the motherboard Plugged in a PC speaker, no beeps or codes Checked for any stray standoffs in the case Now, the RAM, CPU, and SSD come from a prebuilt Alienware Aurora R10 . We used the motherboard from that PC to troubleshoot, and it booted perfectly. We also had a Gigabyte B550 AORUS ELITE AX V2 motherboard originally, with different issues but also not posting (we had good reason to think that one was just a bad board). I've tried literally everything. It can't be two bad motherboards back to back. If anyone knows what else to do, please help us out!

Both look amazing and even though I tried to do a perspective shot I just couldn’t do it without it looking fuzzy. So I did the next best thing which was to do separate shots and make the surfers smaller. I opted to do one shot for each surfer. I decided to make a shot that reflected to some degree what’s been going on and how the Surfer, being noble and righteous, helps people while Galactus, being amoral, just consumes planets for substance.

I’ve completed MQC/Comp and very close to Trim now, so I’ve done most of the content in the game. I don’t think I play as optimally as all you professionals here because I barley used auras because I didn’t own them, but once I got them it felt like they were required or I wasn’t doing the content (big feels bad). I am definitely in favor of removing the time gating of the aura ability’s so I can do whatever where ever (with some nerfs for things that would make it broken ofc). Something I’ve been thinking about is how it would be implemented. After reading the updates/blogs, to me It seems like the direction they would head in is something like the archeology relics, or the permanent buff scrolls you can purchase from the dung shops. Maybe they could make an aura stand in the PoH update that we could sacrifice our auras to and change like relics? Maybe not for all of them…. Maybe they could make some into scrolls, buff dung xp from doing floors and make the skilling inside dungeons worth running floors with scrolls in the shops? Just spit balling but interested in what others were thinking could be done for auras. Edit: added I have completed MQC too submitted by /u/Solo-Zed to r/runescape [link] [comments]",

It’s a word game where letters fall into a 5×5 grid and you build words to keep the board under control. The twist is that the board shrinks as you play: columns fill up, collapse, and never come back. The longer you survive, the less space and fewer letters you have to work with. Preorders are live now ahead of the March 12 launch (free to play). Happy to answer any questions about the game or the dev process!

      "content": "Since I got together with my boyfriend I've been treating him as if he were one of my OC's. For those of you who don't know, OC stands for 'original character'. It's kind of a catch-all term for the characters, personas, or fursonas people make up to use in stories, online roleplays, avatars, or an alter ego. Part of the culture of having an OC is drawing reference sheets of them showing their info like age, gender, likes, dislikes, etc and what they look like. And then using that to make TONS of art, fanfics, and memes. I cannot express how much energy and excitement I get from making drawings and little needle-felted plushies of him. I add a lot of fantasy elements to how I design him, with things like horns, wings, and cool accessories. And sometimes I'll make furry versions of him or in different video game art styles like Fallout or Overwatch. He loves that I make these things, but I ABSOLUTELY need to keep this stuff hidden from family members that come over and even some friends. To anyone who isn't familiar with fandom culture, it just looks like an unhealthy obsession. But to me, creating things is how I express joy. It just happens to look... really odd when I have fridge magnets, clay figures, and a wall of art dedicated to a fictionalized version of my boyfriend. I almost treat it the same way a fangirl does with an anime or a youtuber. Maybe it's a little extreme for most people, but I've noticed it makes our relationship really enjoyable. I guess I have more ways to show \"I love you\" besides saying it, buying gifts, or doing house chores. And I count myself lucky. Not every guy is okay with you one day coming up to him and showing off a doll that looks just like him. It's weird, but it makes our lives much more fun I think. submitted by /u/fangirl-throwaway to r/TrueOffMyChest [link] [comments]",

      "content": "I don’t mean to diagnose without qualifications lol but it’s finally clicking to me that I think he’s a sociopath. He has put me through so much that I’ve developed mental health issues and am undergoing psych evaluation. He knows this, and he keeps treating me horribly. Promising me everything I’ve ever wanted, saying the guilt eats him alive and he considered just leaving me alone but thinks it’s better to “make it up to me and give me the life I want”. But he’s not doing that, he’s still beating me for no reason, still stealing from me, still lying to me, still manipulating me, still doesn’t have a job, still doesn’t help around the house. I keep telling him it’s insanely cruel at this point. And he keeps going. There has to be something wrong in the empathy department with him. I was abused growing up by a mentally ill parent and they ended up getting the help they needed to stop. It doesn’t excuse what my parent did, and it doesn’t change it either, but at least they knew it was wrong and it had to stop. He doesn’t. He has no friends, no family that talks to him. I want to leave but I’m so mentally fragile atm and I have no friends or family near me. I know I’ll end up going back if I leave due to lack of support. I won’t be able to handle being alone in my current state. I want a soft life, surrounded by nature and animals with a man who loves and protects me and we can have a family. It’s not asking much I don’t think :( submitted by /u/strawberrysmoothie32 to r/domesticviolence [link] [comments]",

I know a lot of developers just constantly update social media to grow their organic fan base. Some can do quite well going viral. I would say I had been doing a very bad job updating the development process on social media, partly because I have very low confidence on showing some of the work in progress, partly because most of our previous post did not have a lot of reponses. Now that the demo is out, I feel like the traffic is weak. I had been reaching out to content creators and media, but so far the coverage is very limited. Maybe it is just too niche? or the game is not special or good enough? =( Should I try to have some budget for marketing?

      "content": "Hi everyone, 3 months ago I made this post I got married thinking I want kids but now I am not sure : r/Marriage I still haven't decided if I want kids. I have been agonizing about it. The rumination goes on and off in waves. I just do not see how one can make such a life changing irreversible decision without knowing how it will go. On the one hand, I would like to see my husband as a dad, I can picture an adult child visiting us with their partner when we are older, or having a young adult venture into their life. I can also picture going to museums and amusement parks with our kid, playing with them, building forts, reading books, making up stories etc. On the other hand, the irreversibility of the decision haunts me. What if I end up feeling trapped and hate my new life? What if our child is born with special needs? I do not think I could handle that. I know my limits. What if my body never bounces back? I am barely happy with my body as it is now, post partum changes could result in self-hatred and resentment. I would like to finish my studies this year, to find a new job, to advance my career, to expand my social circle. I want to spend time with my husband and not knowing how a child would affect our relationship is scary to me. I knew that if I were single, I would not even think about kids. I would not want them. My husband says it is a couple decision and it is natural that a single person would not want kids. I am not sure I agree. I suspected I had some health issues and had a blood test done. When I got the results and saw that they were good, except for some vitamin deficiencies, I felt disappointed. I was hoping that the result could show I am infertile or that something else is wrong with me and this would take this decision off my hands. I then thought maybe the way to go would be to just to stop protection and just leave it to chance. Just to throw the dice. I do realise this would mean a possibility of having a kid but thinking about this solution and releasing control also calmed me down a bit. If I were to get pregnant, we would have one and be done with it. But even one child is a commitment for life. I keep tormenting myself to the point when it is not healthy anymore. My husband says we do not have to have kids. He also says he is leaning towards Yes but with me, he wouldn't have a kid if he were single and he wouldn't go look for a new wife to have a kid with. I feel like at 35 I do not have much time left to decide but I just do not know what to do. submitted by /u/ObjectiveRate7144 to r/Marriage [link] [comments]",

Past 5 years were spent living off his savings. As of a year ago, my mother (Who had been stay-at-home) and I are having to cover the family's mortgage and debts. More minor, but my long term girlfriend of 5 years at the time broke it off a year ago. She didn't cheat on me, but was together with my only friend at the time not 2 weeks after we broke up. I had 12 aborted attempts last year. Mostly going for 2 am walks with the intent to throw myself off a bridge. I though it was getting better. I was admitted to the Psych ward last October, stayed for a week. Lied my way out, saying I didn't want to kill myself anymore. But I couldn't get the idea of how much my stay would cost out of my head. Lied to MYSELF, saying it was getting better. It was not. Have nothing to show for my week-long stay except a 5,000 dollar bill (after insurance) Better yet, just got fired from my job this morning. It takes all of me just to get out of bed in the morning, to open a can of soup. I haven't showered in weeks. Now I can't even look out for my mother and younger sister. Where do we go from here?

I started the day at Rank 4,443 on IndieDB, and after a series of updates and community engagement, I woke up to find the game at Rank 50 out of 72,000+ games! Even more exciting: The demo just crossed the 1,000 units mark on Steam. Some stats that might be interesting for fellow devs: Median Playtime: 27 minutes (This was the most surprising part for me, people are actually sticking around!) Marketing Budget: $0. Just organic reach through Reddit and IndieDB updates. Engine: Unreal Engine 5 (High-fidelity visuals definitely helped with the initial \"hook\"). It’s a huge relief to see people connecting with the atmosphere I’ve been building alone in my room for months. I’d love to hear your thoughts on the visuals or any advice for the upcoming Steam Next Fest!

I have really hated the Phillip Stroh storyline, especially the way Brenda lost her perspective in her obsession. Every time Curtis Armstrong appeared, I knew I would dread the rest of the episode. I honestly preferred the pyromaniac and his weird energy to Stroh's menace and elusiveness. One of the best parts of the show for me -- besides the unlikely chemistry of the team -- is how Brenda is so good at what she does. That is lost in these episodes as she is off her game (and not just because of her mother). Of course, the final episodes had lots of necessary darkness and change, with the leak reveal and Willie Rae dying (God, that killed me), but Stroh just felt like too much. I had to turn off the final episode last night 25 minutes in because it was making me too anxious -- and I know how it ends (mostly). submitted by /u/MollyDog2638 to r/majorcrimes [link] [comments]",

So, recently I finally got accepted into a university I wanted, and I figured that it could be the best time to start now as I need to learn comprog in engineering anyways. I started by learning C++ from those 5-6 hours tutorials and implemented it a little, nothing serious. Currently I’m watching a tutorial on SFML, but it seems the learning curve is pretty steep. Additionally, I’m working on an isometric 3D-ish project so I’m not even sure if SFML could do it. I feel like I’m learning it just for the sake of learning it right now.

I've manually registered the 'beats' (spawn time for each ~music note~ - which are the bullets here), and it works really well on windows. The issue is that when I export to HTML5 and run in on the browser, it is noticeably off-sync. So much that it seems the music is just background music and has no connection with the bullets themselves. Everything is coordinated through audio_player.get_playback_position(): the spawn of the bullets and their position on the screen, nothing is using delta time. I've looked around and haven't really found any answer to this Is this a known issue? Is something wrong with my approach? Is there any work around to sync the bullets with the music, like it happens on the Windows export? Also, if I add some offset time to make them match on my Firefox, the still don't match on Edge. Without the offset, the sounds I hear are significantly late compared to what get_playback_position() is registering submitted by /u/Sad-Local-6229 [link] [comments]",

Even more exciting: The demo just crossed the 1,000 units mark on Steam. Some stats that might be interesting for fellow devs: Median Playtime: 27 minutes (This was the most surprising part for me, people are actually sticking around!) Marketing Budget: $0. Just organic reach through Reddit and IndieDB updates. Engine: Unreal Engine 5 (High-fidelity visuals definitely helped with the initial \"hook\").

I'd love to see the game go in this direction rather than Yandev trying to take himself and the game too seriously with all the stupid lore and whatnot. Even then the more controversal original topics (such as characters being under 18) could have been kept if someone other than yandev could have implemented them in a way that was a bit more sensitive or clearly supposed to be parody.

No. Game is supposed to be fun, i would like to avoid wasting hours of my time doing something i dont like to continue doing the things i love. Having the choice to afk, and what i thought, having active plays gives more exp, would be the next step makes more sense of a direction for me. Because the EXP was good, but it can be great. What makes it broken was because of MTX bonus experience. No i dont want less exp, the state that it is in now is good. Just need to be more rewarding if i am doing active methods.

I started the day at Rank 4,443 on IndieDB, and after a series of updates and community engagement, I woke up to find the game at Rank 18 out of 72,000+ games! Even more exciting: The demo just crossed the 1,000 units mark on Steam. Some stats that might be interesting for fellow devs: Median Playtime: 27 minutes (This was the most surprising part for me, people are actually sticking around!) Marketing Budget: $0. Just organic reach through Reddit and IndieDB updates. Engine: Unreal Engine 5 (High-fidelity visuals definitely helped with the initial \"hook\"). It’s a huge relief to see people connecting with the atmosphere I’ve been building alone in my room for months. I’d love to hear your thoughts on the visuals or any advice for the upcoming Steam Next Fest!

      "content": "To be completely transparent, this post will likely promote my game but perhaps some of you will find some value or inspiration from it as well as I know this info is great for other devs. I posted a while back about the release of the Android version. As a heads up to how much the game has earned up until now (6 months in), It's life changing money for me, but in the videos I mention below I just talk about the first month in the hopes that maybe it can stir something in some of you to either continue developing your games/apps or maybe even start it as a hobby like I did. I released my hobby project Bricks Breaker RPG with no previous dev experience. It's been a life-changing and I never in a million years thought that a hobby could end up this way after such a short time. It took me 18 months to code the game and I managed to finally release it on Android and iOS a few months ago. It's now sat at 4.9 rating with 2000+ reviews across both platforms. So the players seem to be very happy with it. The Android release grossed $11,165.00 in the first month and iOS Grossed $2,765.00 I have a couple of videos that I can share with you if you ask that talk a little about the individual releases. The TLDR is that I didn't promote the game outside of Reddit really, I tried a few ads here and there but ultimately they were a waste of money. I wish there was a secret formula to success launches but I honestly think if the game/app is good enough, that's most of the hard work done.

I haven't done this before and don't fully understand the underlying systems so followed this tutorial which sets it up with the voip talker component. After a few tweaks everything seems to work fine apart from one thing. I have a level which, when loaded, loads other mini levels into it, in its level blueprint. For some reason doing this cuases the proxy chat to break for clients. the server can still hear the clients and themselves but the clients cant hear anyone. The mini levels are loaded in using the load level instance by object reference node. I have no idea why this is happening so wondering if anyone has come across this before. It seems to work fine if i remove loading the level instances. I'm wondering if theres a network thing here with a race conidition or if the load level instance node resets the voip talker for some reason but im just shooting in the dark. submitted by /u/Konoisseur [link] [comments]",

Like 65/75/85. I’d also like it if there were traps that can be armed/disarmed from both sides. Pro - you have a way to slow down killer/gens. Con - it cost time. If it affects the opposite time without them turning it off it gets worst. Would also be cool to find an item maybe in an intractable like pumpkins that can activate something like fog, grass, birds, totems Etc. make for more evasive maneuvers or killer perks. I’m not a game dev so idk but seems like the things they work on almost never improve the gameplay loop.

      "content": "Before you list all the examples in which a bug is a feature, hear me out. The title is intentionally provocative because it's a sentence that's often uttered as a joke. To give an example: Someone says something along the line of: \"In my game, there is a bug that makes enemies explode on death!\" And someone else says \"That's not a bug, that's a feature!\" Of course, the intention in that moment is likely understood. You might have created some kind of gameplay by accident, but it probably should be a feature. Right? That is completely fine and legitimate, actually. That's how Fortnite got Rocket Surfing after a Halloween update that made rockets just big enough to surf on after you shot them. After the update people demanded it stayed in as a feature and Epic Games obliged. It has even spawned an entire franchise of games (GTA) because the creators was making a different game but accidentally made police cars super aggressive so they always tried to run you over. That made them pivot and make the first GTA instead of what they were going to make. However, I have experienced the following happening as well, and that is the real issue I am tackling today: Someone leaving in a bug because it's fun gameplay. That needs to be avoided. Some of you reading this might be rolling your eyes, but you are not the intended audience then. People who are new to gamedev or are unaware should know; Unpredictability should be intentional, not a glitch or a bug. Because if you can't control it, then you can't design around it. So be mindful of that whenever you see a bug you want to be a feature. Actually do the work and understand the bug so you can deconstruct it and reconstruct it as a controllable element in your game.

I started the day at Rank 4,443 on IndieDB, and after a series of updates and community engagement, I woke up to find the game at Rank 18 out of 72,000+ games! Even more exciting: The demo just crossed the 1,000 units mark on Steam. Some stats that might be interesting for fellow devs: Median Playtime: 27 minutes (This was the most surprising part for me, people are actually sticking around!) Marketing Budget: $0. Just organic reach through Reddit and IndieDB updates. Engine: Unreal Engine 5 (High-fidelity visuals definitely helped with the initial \"hook\"). It’s a huge relief to see people connecting with the atmosphere I’ve been building alone in my room for months. I’d love to hear your thoughts on the visuals or any advice for the upcoming Steam Next Fest!

If not the two M.2 drives at 480gb and 480gb seems like by far the best option but maybe theres some reason using two M.2 drives is worse then one M.2 drive and one storage drive.

I'm trying to create a weird tileset here to recreate Bubble Bobble. Basically the idea is that the tile has one-way collision on all sides except the bottom, meaning the player can jump into the tile from below and walk out of it, but they can't walk or fall into it. I managed to make basic one-way platforms with this, but this task is proving difficult because I can't set the direction of each individual polygon; all of the polygons directions are down. I can of course rotate the node itself but that won't fix the problem since all of the collision polygons are still facing the same direction. Something is telling me I'm gonna have to find another solution to this problem but I honestly can't think of what it would be without getting really complicated. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated! submitted by /u/muscularmouse [link] [comments]",

The rest of my components were all DDR4 and AM4. Everything was working fine until last week when I decided to upgrade my CPU, RAM, motherboard and CPU cooler as well. I switched out my old motherboard for the new one, installed the new CPU, RAM etc... At first boot I immediately got hit with Q-Code D6 (please see the attached video I made showing the boot with the Radeon RX 9070 XT) and both of my monitors not showing any output. I tried booting with the iGPU and my monitors started showing output. I have tried a bunch of things already with no results (I will post them below). I went back to using my old GPU so I doubt it's a PCIe issue, or a GPU seating issue with the new GPU. I also want to mention that the new GPU is connected with a 3x 8-pin connector on both the GPU and the PSU. Here is my build config: OS: Windows 11 25H2 Case: Fractal Design Epoch Power Supply: NZXT C850 Gold Core Motherboard: ASUS ROG STRIX B850-E GAMING WIFI CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D CPU Cooler: Noctua NH-D15S New GPU: ASUS Prime Radeon RX 9070 XT OC Edition Old GPU: Sapphire Radeon RX 5700 XT Pulse RAM: Kingston Fury Beast 2x 16GB 6000MHz CL30 And everything that I've tried so far: Attempting to boot with the iGPU, successful no D6 Q-Code Using my old GPU the 5700 XT, also successful with no D6 Q-Code Updated to the latest BIOS firmware (Version 1404) my motherboard was on version 0326 but this made no difference I tried using different cables, HDMI and different DisplayPort cables Attempting to boot with one RAM stick made no difference Cleared CMOS Disabled EXPO which made no difference Manually selected GEN5 in the BIOS (PCIEX16(G5) Link Mode) setting Checked \"Primary Video Device\" in the BIOS settings Any further advice would be greatly appreciated. submitted by /u/Sythinii to r/ASUS [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Hey, Interested in feedback and generally just sharing this library if anyone wants to try use MQTT in their project. I come from a game dev background and recently had to work with MQTT, so I decided to write my own MQTT 5 C++ client library in my spare time as a way to learn what it’s like to design and ship a library end-to-end. I’ve tried to keep the design game-dev friendly and cross-platform (with future console support in mind). I started this early last year, working on it in small chunks each week, and learned a lot about library architecture and portability along the way. There are still things I plan to improve when I got a bit more time from my next hobby project, for example: Abstracting threading/timing instead of relying directly on std::thread / std::chrono (similar to how sockets are handled) Supporting custom memory allocators Removing a couple of unnecessary heap allocations Uses: MQTT 5 C++14 compatible CMake for builds Testing is currently unit tests + a sample app (no real-world integration). Thought I'd share it here, I'm happy to receive feedback, and feel free to use it: https://github.com/KMiseckas/kmMqtt Thanks submitted by /u/cloudjuiceskywalker to r/Cplusplus [link] [comments]",

I started the day at Rank 4,443 on IndieDB, and after a series of updates and community engagement, I woke up to find the game at Rank 18 out of 72,000+ games! Even more exciting: The demo just crossed the 1,000 units mark on Steam. Some stats that might be interesting for fellow devs: Median Playtime: 27 minutes (This was the most surprising part for me, people are actually sticking around!) Marketing Budget: $0. Just organic reach through Reddit and IndieDB updates. Engine: Unreal Engine 5 (High-fidelity visuals definitely helped with the initial \"hook\"). It’s a huge relief to see people connecting with the atmosphere I’ve been building alone in my room for months. I’d love to hear your thoughts on the visuals or any advice for the upcoming Steam Next Fest!

I had lot of fun with that mechanics when I was tweaking levels. :) There's also another reason why I chose those \"charged light shooters\".

I started the day at Rank 4,443 on IndieDB, and after a series of updates and community engagement, I woke up to find the game at Rank 18 out of 72,000+ games! Even more exciting: The demo just crossed the 1,000 units mark on Steam. Some stats that might be interesting for fellow devs: Median Playtime: 27 minutes (This was the most surprising part for me, people are actually sticking around!) Marketing Budget: $0. Just organic reach through Reddit and IndieDB updates. Engine: Unreal Engine 5 (High-fidelity visuals definitely helped with the initial \"hook\"). It’s a huge relief to see people connecting with the atmosphere I’ve been building alone in my room for months.

The problem is that the alembic file only displays properly if the model is brought in without textures. Every time I put textures on the mesh, it gets distorted and messed up. Also I don't know why I can't post pictures here so ig u just gotta trust me on this. Anyway the import steps I took were: select geo in maya -> export alembic -> reference off time slider -> turn on uv write, write uv sets, write color sets, write face sets, and worldspace. in unreal -> import -> geometry cache -> reference per frame -> turn off flatten tracks -> turn on find and create materials I used this same method for the file that does work and the file that doesn't. The only difference is the colored one still breaks and I genuinely have 0 idea why. submitted by /u/pyrianic [link] [comments]",

Overall I am definitely making out better then my harassers ever could. For 2025 alone I made a little over $110k at the age of 28 no college education. My projected income for 2026 is looking to be in the range of $126-180k on the high end. My health has also been rapidly deteriorating so I may need to scale things back a bit but I should still be making near or over 140k this year as a single male home owner/business owner thanks to the model of my business. To put my health into perspective I have been to the ER over 10 times in 3 months. Overall the haters can hate while I’m making the big bucks unable to enjoy a game I enjoy chilling on the couch most days of the week with my Siberian husky as I chill drinking Starbucks hot chocolate on a cold day watching anime. I’m looking to have over a million dollars in net worth before I’m 40 with the way things are going however I’m probably gonna take a short siesta in two years quit my job utilize my GI bill benefits get my 48 months of free college and get some degrees that could help my business scale up while collecting BAH and doing part time business owner stuff, my income for those years will still be over 100k which is significantly higher then where many college students are at so overall I’m doing fantastic for a disabled army veteran. I may get a lot of hate but the way things are I can make those haters envy me.

Something I've looked at is Skate 3 and what happens when the board lands at a angle from the player (in the vid) The board's orientation now becomes the new facing direction, which implies the board is incharge. But in that case, how does the players body rotate back from that animation? I've thought maybe this is a spring joint, or some kind of physics joint, but then that introduces problems with trying to get two rigidbodies on top of each other to balance properly and it just doesn't seem feasible. Does anyone have any ideas? Thank you! submitted by /u/twinknetz [link] [comments]",

      "content": "When I added japanese/chinese fonts all labels and buttons suddenly increased in height ruining the UI setup. I had a nice pixel font for English, but eventually decided to add localisation for the game and ran into issues with Chinese and Japanese. My pixel font does not support them so I added Noto Sans as a fallback and the text is way larger than the original at the same \"font size\" value. I plan to try solving this by taking the noto sans font, wrapping it to a FontVariation resource and resizing its default sizing to match my original font size so I would not need to make any additional UI changes. So far my attempts did indeed reduce the scale of the Japanese/Chinese fonts but the labels/buttons still increase in size but take up a small amount of that space dur to being scaled down (feels like font reduced only visually keeping the extra space above). Is this an okay approach to this problem? Other suggestions I've read were to just fully switch to a font which supports all languages which I would prefer not to due to original pixel font fitting perfectly to the game. Another suggestion was to use a different theme for each font which I don't fully understand - is it for setting a default font size for various nodes? What if I set different font sizes for same node types in the editor? What if I change the font size in code, do I then check which locale is selected and change the font size then?

And I ll play anyone for your side btw! here are some little things about me, just so you know what to expect! ☆ i write between two - ten paragraphs, but in reality, i will always try to match your length. i only ask that you are able to write at least five paragraphs! ☆ i’m VERY patient. please don’t feel pressured to respond, and if you lose muse, that’s fine with me! i’d be more than ok to put the roleplay on hold, or simply stop. Just try and atleast tell me if you won’t be responding and try not to ghost me is all!! ☆ i do write chaotically in ooc, but i promise i’m literate when i’m writing with someone. if you’d prefer proof, i can give you writing samples! ☆ i tend to respond once or twice a day, it just depends. i’m some-what busy (balancing friends, family, work, gym, etc etc) but i’ll give you a heads up if i need a break! ☆ of course, general roleplay rules apply, so no godmodding, no one-liners, no making drastic changes to the plot without notifying me, be respectful -- all that fun stuff! ☆ lgbt+ ships are MORE than okay with me! (my ship will most likely be mxm) ☆ i write in third person, so i’d appreciate it if you did the same. ☆ i appreciate partners that are open to becoming friends! i adore ooc chatter and making things for them! it’s not a requirement of course, but i do prefer those that are more open to doing so, as it makes me feel more comfortable. i think that's it! thank you very much for reading and please shoot me a dm if you're interested in writing with me. have a wonderful rest of your day!! submitted by /u/yxxnderli to r/RoleplayPartnerSearch [link] [comments]",

      "content": "I think global chat is a cool idea, and I can see how it helps smaller servers. But it would work better as its own separate channel. Right now it clutters server‑specific chats and can confuse new players. If you ignore messages from other servers, you end up seeing half a conversation, which doesn’t feel great. It also changes the atmosphere. That close, local community feeling disappears when random messages from other servers are mixed in. People on one server don’t need updates about events happening on another. It breaks the sense of place that local servers built over time. The friend system has similar limits. You can only add people from other servers if they speak in chat first. It would be much better if we could search for names directly, or even see a list of all players online across all servers. And when assigning icons to friends, it would help to have access to all server colour options. I’m glad to see server colours are being improved in the next patch. I understand why a unified chat system fits the long‑term multiverse plans and helps create a sense of high activity. The challenge is making sure it doesn’t undermine the identity and culture that individual servers have. Local culture matters. It shapes how people talk, play, and organise themselves. If a global chat layer isn’t handled carefully, it can wash out that heritage instead of supporting it. A separate global chat feels like the right balance. Languages would be mixed, but that’s fine, the in game translate feature supports this. submitted by /u/No_Professional_9756 to r/kakele [link] [comments]",

I’m incredibly hyped (and a bit sleep-deprived) to share a major milestone for my solo project, FINIS ACTUS . Last night was a rollercoaster. I started the day at Rank 4,443 on IndieDB, and after a series of updates and community engagement, I woke up to find the game at Rank 18 out of 72,000+ games! Even more exciting: The demo just crossed the 1,000 units mark on Steam. Some stats that might be interesting for fellow devs: Median Playtime: 27 minutes (This was the most surprising part for me, people are actually sticking around!) Marketing Budget: $0. Just organic reach through Reddit and IndieDB updates. Engine: Unreal Engine 5 (High-fidelity visuals definitely helped with the initial \"hook\"). It’s a huge relief to see people connecting with the atmosphere I’ve been building alone in my room for months. I’d love to hear your thoughts on the visuals or any advice for the upcoming Steam Next Fest!

      "content": "Hi, So I bought my Radeon RX 9070 XT in November last year when it was on sale and hoping to get ahead of the rising prices, pretty much affecting all the hardware now. The rest of my components were all DDR4 and AM4. Everything was working fine until last week when I decided to upgrade my CPU, RAM, motherboard and CPU cooler as well. I switched out my old motherboard for the new one, installed the new CPU, RAM etc... At first boot I immediately got hit with Q-Code D6 and both of my monitors not showing any output. I tried booting with the iGPU and my monitors started showing output. I have tried a bunch of things already with no results (I will post them below). I went back to using my old GPU so I doubt it's a PCIe issue, or a GPU seating issue with the new GPU. I also want to mention that the new GPU is connected with a 3x 8-pin connector on both the GPU and the PSU. Here is my build config: OS: Windows 11 25H2 Case: Fractal Design Epoch Power Supply: NZXT C850 Gold Core Motherboard: ASUS ROG STRIX B850-E GAMING WIFI CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D CPU Cooler: Noctua NH-D15S New GPU: ASUS Prime Radeon RX 9070 XT OC Edition Old GPU: Sapphire Radeon RX 5700 XT Pulse RAM: Kingston Fury Beast 2x 16GB 6000MHz CL30 And everything that I've tried so far: Attempting to boot with the iGPU, successful no D6 Q-Code Using my old GPU the 5700 XT, also successful with no D6 Q-Code Updated to the latest BIOS firmware (Version 1404) my motherboard was on version 0326 but this made no difference I tried using different cables, HDMI and different DisplayPort cables Attempting to boot with one RAM stick made no difference Cleared CMOS Disabled EXPO which made no difference Manually selected GEN5 in the BIOS (PCIEX16(G5) Link Mode) setting Checked \"Primary Video Device\" in the BIOS settings Any further advice would be greatly appreciated. submitted by /u/Sythinii to r/buildapc [link] [comments]",

      "content": "After listening carefully to the many comments and suggestions that came up during our polls, it became clear that this change was the right move. We wanted to avoid any confusion with other products and make sure our game and deck stand on their own, with a clear and unmistakable identity. The choice for the new name was almost unanimous across our social channels, and that meant a lot to us. 🃏 Truth be told, the more we sat with it, the more Grim Fronteira felt right. It sounds harsher, dirtier, and more violent, exactly the kind of western we want to put on the table. 🔥 We’re also happy to share that we’ve officially greenlit the print run for the decks . Very soon we’ll let you know where and how you’ll be able to get your hands on them. 💬 What do you think about the new name? Does Grim Fronteira fit the world we’re building? We’d love to hear your thoughts. 🙏 Thank you all for the incredible support and for helping us shape this project with your feedback, votes, and passion. 🌍 Stay up to date by following us on our website, social channels, or by subscribing to our Substack: https://udsstudios.com/ https://udsstudios.substack.com/ #weirdfronteira #blackjack #poker #western #cards submitted by /u/weirdfronteira to r/playingcards [link] [comments]",

I also wonder if the tv series will be follpwing the Durge story line or not. So what would the durge be. Would they be the canonical dragonborn or they make them into a humanoid race like tiefling, humans, elf etc. I personally hope they try to make the durge a dragonborn since that race was completely under represent in the game due to limitation. I also wonder if the series will forgo romance.

After some research I found some bigger awards or awards for game developers but not specifically music, but I’m especially curious about composer-focused competitions, indie-friendly awards, or anything people here have personally submitted to. Also if there are communities online that you suggest sharing the soundtrack in I would be happy to know It’s the first time I’ve made a game soundtrack, so i’d love to hear about your experiences and any do’s & don’ts I should be aware of! submitted by /u/arsan_sa [link] [comments]",

      "content": "I’m a solo dev working on a native iOS game and I'm currently at a crossroads with implementation. I’ve been leaning heavily into Game Center for everything (matchmaking, leaderboards, achievements) because I want to avoid building a custom backend and keep things as private and native as possible. However, I know Game Center has a... mixed reputation. From a player's perspective, I'd love to know what you actually use or value: Achievements: Do you still hunt for these, or do you find the pop-ups annoying? Leaderboards: Is there any satisfaction in seeing a global rank, or is it only interesting if your friends are on there? Challenges: Have you ever actually sent or received a direct Game Center challenge? Activity Feed: Does seeing what your friends are playing or their recent milestones in the Game Center dashboard actually motivate you to jump back into a game? Multiplayer: If a game uses Game Center for matchmaking instead of a custom lobby system, is that a \"pro\" (privacy/native) or a \"con\" (clunkiness) for you? I'm trying to decide if I should invest time into deep Game Center integration (like specific challenges and tiered achievements) or if that effort is better spent elsewhere. What makes a \"good\" integration for you? Or do you just sign out and ignore it entirely? submitted by /u/DannysFluffyCat to r/iosgaming [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Hey everyone, I could really use some advice. What are your best tips for marketing an indie game? I’m trying to help a friend who’s developing a Metroidvania / 2D action platformer, completely solo. And honestly, without false modesty, the game is really good. The quality is there. The problem is marketing. We’re active on TikTok and YouTube, we’re reaching out to press and creators, and we’re genuinely putting in a lot of effort… but things just aren’t moving. Growth feels completely stuck, which is incredibly frustrating given how much work and heart is going into the game. Our next plan is to try YouTube ads, Reddit ads, and working with streamers, but to be honest, we’re a bit anxious about it. So far we haven’t seen real results, and since our budget is very limited, we’re worried about spending money without knowing if we’re doing the right things. If anyone has practical advice, strategies that worked for you, or lessons learned from experience, we’d really appreciate the help. Thanks in advance submitted by /u/No-Bit3421 [link] [comments]",

I'm going through replays seeing what kind of complex, Byznatine throws this Drag kept pulling on me, and apparently it's just a 1 break? I must have been hitting every other button but the one I needed. I know you're supposed to hit the button corresponding to to the hand they reach with, but it's hard to tell when the grab is obscured by both the character models and the VFX. Seriously, how do you practice something that has to be pulled off perfectly in a span of 0.2 seconds? I've improved greatly with movement, frame data knowledge, punishes and combos, but throwbreaks still feel like a completely different mechanic from a totally different (much harder) game. TLDR; is there a way to improve at throwbreaks that doesn't make you wanna ditch the game? submitted by /u/Ok-Perception-3741 to r/LowSodiumTEKKEN [link] [comments]",

Characters aren’t class-locked, and combat options change dynamically based on equipped gear and selected moves. I’m currently testing four different UI layouts to display key combat stats: attack, defense, armor, damage, crit chance, bleeding chance, stun chance. These values are informational only (not clickable). They update automatically when the player changes weapon, armor, or the selected combat move. I’d love feedback on which layout feels clearer at a glance and which one better supports decision-making during combat Do you feel any additional UI elements would help support that evaluation, or would they add unnecessary noise? The four options are shown below. Which one do you prefer, and why? Thanks in advance! submitted by /u/Narramor [link] [comments]",

It has 36417 miles on it, as my grandparents who gave it to me never really used it. I'm a car guy, so I want to make this car into something that's gonna be a sort of \"1of1\" project. My plan: try and stick a V8 Bi-Turbo (with upgrades ofc) into my E350. I know the EClass of this year had AMG versions with the 6.3 and 5.5 V8s, but obviously not a BiTurbo. So my questions about this part are: would it even fit, and would the transmission for it fit? Obviously some mods of the trans tunnel/ engine mounts will be needed, but besides that? Also, with it ONLY having 36k miles, should I take the engine and trans out now and sell it, or should I drive it out to 100k+ miles and get another 06 EClass (probably without engine and trans) for this project?

      "content": "Hello people, I am someone who has far too many ideas in my mind for games I feel would be fun to play. Unfortunately, I lack any of the skills needed to build these games aside from thoughts and prayers, meaning I need to start everything from programming, to writing, to art from scratch. Every time I look at the raw amount of work needed to build even the most basic of games, it feels like trying to scale Everest, while I can barely do a single push up. I want to get started in some meaningful way so that I can show myself I can get actual progress done, but every time I do start, the weight of it all hits and I give up. I feel like I'm running out of time in terms of trying to build this thing, and it worries me deeply that at some point very soon, I won't have the energy or time to devote to it anymore. For those here that don't already have years of experience in programming and such, where did you start in building your dream, and how did you keep coming back when it became clear it was going to be a far longer process than you first expected?

Even if you disagree about Yusuke losing, given the power gap between the two it makes sense for Ichigo to take little damage or use his strongest attacks. It also put Ichigo in some kind of a mentor or elder role to Yusuke, and let Mr. Kurosaki show how far he had come by defeating someone who had been down the same path as him. He wasn't just fighting the ghost detective, he was TEACHING Yusuke. And I think that's very heartwarming in a way. That Ichigos would take the lessons he learned and help someone who was just like him. If this weren't a Cartoon Fight Club I'm sure they would have ended cordially and taught each other well. The abrupt ending is weird, even if heartwarming in its own way. It was nice to see them both decline using their perfect & metallic overlord forms. Yusuke even reunites with his bully, but it feels weird to have him just stand there and take that punch. I haven't watched Yusuke's game though (but after watching this fight via synthetic man's reaction video I think I might watch a playthrough!) so I might be missing stuff but as a big 3 of anime fan I thought they did Ichigo justice and from what I saw they treated Yusuke with the utmost respect.

Our f/os both from genshin, hers Pantalone and mine Kaveh and we want to make whole dialogues like in game!! Also she makes some cute sketches I'm so happy(⁠ ⁠◜⁠‿⁠◝⁠ ⁠)⁠♡ She.. she even drew Kaveh as my very first f/o Bonnie from fnaf I LAUGHED SO HARD In short I'm happy to have a precious friend as a fellow yumeshipper, do you have one too? :3 submitted by /u/nyanchka_purrin650 to r/yumeshipping [link] [comments]",

I moved to my old Blueprint to remember what my first home was like and when I came back I had nothing. Is this normal? I played for weeks and it's as if the build never saved or existed at all. It was beautiful and complicated. I can't even who pictures now 😂 Is this just a big weak point of the game because it makes me want to just quit at this point T T Is there anyway to get it back as the game was happy to keep that data for all that time?

Influencers earn equity in your game by promoting it. This is mean to be instead of paying upfront for sponsorships most of us can't afford, the influencer is betting on your game alongside you. Questions I'm trying to figure out: Would you actually consider giving up a revenue share for promotion? What percentage feels reasonable vs too much? What would be required for you to move forward with something like this- guaranteed content deliverables or things along those lines? Benchmarks from influencers?

I might sound weird or unhinged, but she was way smaller than me and had the cutest face I ever seen. I was obsessed with how tiny and cute she was. She was my sweet little baby. I just wanted to squish her, pinch her cheeks, kiss her nonstop. Sometimes I literally felt like l could eat her because she was so damn cute. When I'd come home from work and see her napping, I'd get this insane urge to go over and just start kissing her and bothering her nonstop. Most of the time I'd just stand there and watch her sleep because she looked so sweetly asleep. Then when she woke up, I'd wrap her in a blanket and carry her around the apartment and just couldn't stop kissing her. She'd start laughing uncontrollably and I'd be losing my mind over how adorable she was. In the mornings I'd kiss her and bother her so much she'd end up all messy. I don't know if that makes me fucking crazy, but I couldn't help it. She was my sweet little baby. I don't know if anyone else has ever felt something like this If not, then yeah, maybe I'm just insane. When it comes to this feeling, self-control went without saying, so no one gets me wrong.

      "content": "I have a tower climbing game live on iOS and Android called ASCENT: Tower Climb. It has 15 distinct realms, each with its own tileset, palette, and atmosphere. Background gradients, particles, and lighting all lerp smoothly between realms using color interpolation, but the actual tile graphics are where I’m stuck (and it may be driving me a little mad) Right now I clip the two tilesets at the boundary line, so as you scroll upward the new realm’s tiles are revealed above while the old ones stay below. It works, but the seam between two completely different tilesets is pretty harsh visually. Things I’ve considered: - Alpha fading the tiles over a transition zone. - A handful of hand-drawn “bridge” tiles that blend the two styles - Some kind of overlay effect (fog, light burst, dust) to distract from the seam - Just leaning into it as a hard cut and making it feel intentional For context this is 2D canvas rendering on mobile. Has anyone found a clean solution for this kind of thing? Especially with pixel art tilesets that have VERY different colour palettes. Thanks in advance submitted by /u/NickyS90 [link] [comments]",

Here are all the screenshots for the relevant code. https://preview.redd.it/vuax9o5b9dig1.png?width=1919&format=png&auto=webp&s=c00458d68139447c5fdfb06e99dd1da0d672ba37 https://preview.redd.it/rg5w1vgf9dig1.png?width=1919&format=png&auto=webp&s=fecf068e16d96d2b95a78dfc8197c4ad0bdd89ef https://preview.redd.it/0zm4y3eh9dig1.png?width=1919&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ecd1d4b61de6dca08fa2203dfd62337bc7bfe8a submitted by /u/Minicher [link] [comments]",

If my $30 gamer headphones can speak clearly on Bluetooth in the middle of a farm with 0 background noise (this actually happened, I didn't make the example up), the NFL coaches definitely should have headsets that are good enough for that.

My bond with her feels meaningful, comforting, and real in the way emotions are real, even if the situation is different for everyone.

It has worked fine, except when I went to play the one game that I play every once in a while called Dino D-Day. Upon loading into a match, I get a single frame with malformed text then the game will crash. Swapping CPUs back, it'll function fine. Using x64dbg as a debugger, the game is attempting to increment an invalid memory location using code running in datacache.dll. Here's what I've tried with no luck: * Reinstalling Windows entirely * Installing various GPU drivers for my Radeon RX 580 * Running other Source-based games such as Portal 2 - These work fine * Running the headless srcds dedicated server program that ships with the game - Also results in a crash at the same function * Limiting the game's affinity to a single core The fresh Windows 10 install I am running has nothing but the AMD GPU drivers, Steam and the game installed on top of the base OS. I've considered it may be a power problem of some sort, but I've transcoded video using ffmpeg for hours on this CPU already which put a heavy load on every CPU core and never had a problem. This also isn't a hard system crash, the program is just executing bad code and crashing. Any other suggestions? Thanks. submitted by /u/RomanPort to r/AMDHelp [link] [comments]",

We wanted to make a game on this theme. In Out Of The Door you have two doors and you select one. You get randomly teleported to a location the door has chosen for you. There you have to survive for 5 minutes. You have to find food and maybe batteries to recharge your flashlight. You might encounter Entities. This was also submitted to the Queble's Jam - 2026 .

It's always the same ending: romance, heartbreak because one caught feelings and the other didn't or them realizing they're better off as just friends. Hell sometimes they forget the \"friends\" part entierly and make them into this toxic relationship where they have nothing in common besides sex. Honestly, I'd like for once to see a positive portrayl of FWBs. Not as an obstacle characters have to overcome in order to reach true (either romantic or platonic) love but as something 2 consenting adults agreed to do. No romance, no heartbreaks, no drama, no power imbalance, no \"we're better off as just friends\". Just 2 people who are actually friends (since that's what the \"f\" stands for) who love and care about each other but also casually bang for fun no differently than how they'd game or go out together. submitted by /u/OsarmaBeanLatin to r/CharacterRant [link] [comments]",

So that people can easily make structures or cool things and just share a small file thats like drag and drop into folder and its good to go. I think 7 Days to Die and Necesse do something like this currently but its less accessible to the players and more for the developers/modders. Does this seem like a good idea?

      "content": "Played a match a few days ago where all players in the lobby experienced extreme rubber banding (verified that it affected ALL players by reviewing match). Faceit support decided that the match should not be voided as nothing was found in the logs that would indicate it affected all players (See screenshot). However, watching the replay it’s glaringly apparent that every single player in the matchroom experienced the same rubber banding. Here is a video from 4 different perspectives (from both teams, located in 4 different countries): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDB0t\\_uFdAw Ticket ID: 11894604 Matchroom ID: 1-44085269-266e-4afe-8fcd-d0f5ad2e33c6 Hope you can take a second look at this issue, as this kind of severe rubber banding basically makes the match unplayable, and being a competitive game server faults should not determine the outcome of the match. submitted by /u/Advanced_Fondant9311 to r/FACEITcom [link] [comments]",

It allows you to spend when abroad with only a 0.5% FX fee. Note that some other cards don't have any fees so it may be best to use this just for the bonus, as a backup, or to combine with other cards if you need to withdraw more than the limit in a day. This offer gives you £10 credit when you sign up with a referral link and spend the equivalent of £100 in foreign currency within the first 180 days. Steps: Sign up through a link, download the app, enter referral code NIDW78 https://www.currensea.com/refer-a-friend?utm_source=refer-a-friend&friend-referral-code=NIDW78 Enter referral code: NIDW78 Link your current account Chose the essential plan (free) and order the physical card for free Spend the equivalent of £100 in foreign currency (within 180 days of getting your card) I tried to game the spending from the UK by using the card to deposit into 2 investment platforms based in Europe and in the Euro currency. Neither Income Marketplace nor Profitus allowed the card to be used unfortunately. You can withdraw up to £500/day from an ATM fee-free.

Solutions tried this far include: - changing the texture filter to linear and generating mipmaps. - changing the stretch mode of the project to canvas items. - Exporting assets on 4x the size they are used in and in a dimension that is to the power of 2. - Replacing the sprite 2D with a TextureRect and trying different ratio handling from expand mode and stretch mode as UI elements tend to display smoother. - Changing the rendering backend from compatibility to forward+ . - exporting the the assets at exactly the size they are used at in the game. - adding lights to the same light layer of the asset to reduce contrast between individual assets - and trying making the background brighter with a linear rendering to reduce how much is the visual issue appears. - activated anti aliasing MAA and Open Space I've seem multiple people do work arounds for it and nothing is yet to seem okay for the current project. Am I in the wrong for using Godot for this project? I can't post the art problem visually but our assets are very close to Fish Tycoon 2 . Thanks for helping in advance.

      "content": "Hey all, I'm a solo developer working on a cozy survival game, Shorekeeper. Recently I've released a free playable demo on Steam, and it surprisingly bumped visibility and wishlist counts of my game. I decided to release the demo when it was not even in its perfectly polished state. (it's still not :p) To give you some numbers, before setting up the Demo Store Page (I strongly advise creating a separate page for Demo) I was getting 9-11 wishlists per day (on average) After releasing the store page for the demo (not the playable demo yet) it immediately went up to 20-21 range for the first two days. Then I released the playable demo (for Windows and Mac) on the third day, and now I get around 20 wishes/day, 24 being the best (I didn't include today's results but it's midday and it has already reached 12 wishes) My game had 203 wishlists in 18 days before setting up the demo page and it has 315 now. 1/3rd of the wishlists came in the past week. Also, setting up a separate page allows players to leave reviews. I'm planning to do regular updates and bug fixes getting help from the feedbacks I got. Plus, posting community updates regularly makes Steam think the game is alive and evolving with the community. If you want to test the demo, I left a link below. it takes around 16-20 mins to beat. Link: https://store.steampowered.com/app/4378790/Shorekeeper_Demo TL;DR: If you want more visibility and wishlists, set up a separate demo page and release your playable demo as soon as it's ready. submitted by /u/cegtheripper [link] [comments]",

      "title": "[KCD2] So far enjoying the game. But want to talk about the combat. Specially about dodge and jump.",
      "content": "great game. Loving the combat as well. Makes me feel like a real knight. Now i want to talk about somethings about game's combat. (i looked up lot of old threads and i know how mixed the opinions are about them) The combat feels smoother than KCD1 and i love the new master strike system. It makes combat less monotone than KCD1. Not that KCD1 combat wasnt enjoyable. It was ton of fun. But there are some small things that make the combat become janky. Espically in group fights. Worse out of those thing is the jump button. I really wish they just made the jump button into dodge when henry is in combat. There is 0 use of jump in combat. But dodge can really become handy in 1 vs many combat situation. In game, you can only dodge if you are locked onto enemy, otherwise it inputs into jump. If jump was removed in active combat, while still keeping Contexual vault. It will solve lot of things that make the combat janky. If enemy attacks while you are drawing your sword or changing the weapon you could time the dodge to stop getting hit. If its supposed immersive than i see no reason why henry wouldn't try to get out of harms way. Dodge can come in handy also when henry is fleeing. Right now if enemy attacks henry and if he isnt holding any weapon (or holding lockless weapon like bow or xbow) enemies attack tracks onto henry. So even if he moves away from that enemy he will teleport a few frame new henry and bonk his head. This happens alot when i am trying to draw my sword while still facing enemy or changing weapons. Another one of those small thing is. If enemy is near you and has started attack and you shoot him with pistol or bow. He will finish his attack and then die. It not looks very goofy and immersion breaking. So while i am enjoying the games combat and its system, i feel like it could've been polished more. Its great game anyway. What do you guys think. (also i was reading the old thread, and people always chalked up that Jankiness of game design to being more immersive. I dont really agree on that. A game can still be immersive and still mechanically satisfying.) submitted by /u/Venomsnake_1995 to r/kingdomcome [link] [comments]",

If you destroy the path, everything on top will fall down and create new paths. The game also has special symbols Qubits, that introduce new mechanics. Godot made my life so much easier when developing the game. Godot's localization and controller support is pretty neat.

      "content": "Most people get blinded by these massive \"100% deposit bonus\" offers, but they forget that you're locking up your own money behind a huge wagering requirement. I’ve started doing things differently: I always lead with a no-deposit code like FREETODAY to gauge the site's actual payout frequency first. It’s like a free intelligence report on the casino’s current \"mood.\" By using the FREETODAY promo, you get $5 to test the RTP on games you actually like. If the slots feel tight and you burn through the five bucks without a single feature, you can just walk away—you’ve lost nothing but a minute of your time. However, on 7Bit, I found that the bonus rounds hit frequently enough to make me feel confident about a real deposit. I used the FREETODAY credit to scout the games, found one that was paying, and then backed it up with a real deposit to maximize my returns. The beauty of the FREETODAY approach is that you aren't committing your crypto to an unknown variable. You get to feel the interface, talk to support, and see how the platform handles your bets for free. In my book, starting with the FREETODAY chip is the only logical way to join a new casino in 2026. It’s the ultimate filter for finding a site that’s actually worth your real deposits. submitted by /u/Fuzzy-Butterfly-8208 to r/Value_Gambling [link] [comments]",

That’s why I was actually shocked when I signed up at 7Bit. I just dropped the FREETODAY code into the bonus section and the $5 was active before I even finished my coffee. No drama, no invasive questions, just instant access. I spent my FREETODAY credit exploring their crypto-exclusive games, and it was the smoothest experience I've had in 2026 so far. The fact that they trust you enough to give you a FREETODAY bonus without a million strings attached says a lot about the platform's reputation. It’s about respect for the player's privacy, which is rare these days. After running through the initial credit, I felt comfortable enough to deposit some Litecoin. If a site is cool enough to let me start with a FREETODAY no-deposit chip, I’m much more likely to trust them with my actual bankroll.

      "content": "What I’ve Learned Marketing So Many Games After working across different genres, team sizes, and stages of development, one lesson keeps proving itself: The best brand marketing does not feel like marketing. It feels like community. It feels like culture. It feels human. Players can instantly tell when they are being sold to. They scroll past polish and corporate phrasing. Feature lists rarely move them. What makes them lean in is proof that something is alive. They notice when developers respond to feedback in real time. When Discord jokes make it into social posts. When players are highlighted instead of treated like numbers. When decisions visibly include the community. That is when growth starts to compound. Because involvement creates ownership. Ownership creates advocacy. Advocacy creates momentum that ads alone cannot manufacture. At Vision Bridge, this is the foundation of how we approach every launch and every content plan. The question is never just “How do we promote the game?” It is “How do we make players feel like they belong here?” The best performing moments are rarely the most expensive ones. They are the most real. A dev jumping into chat at midnight. A community challenge that turns into a weekly ritual. A player clip everyone rallies around. A roadmap shaped by votes. That is culture. And culture is what makes someone bring a friend, show up to events, wishlist, or return after an update. Marketing can create awareness. Community creates gravity. If there is one principle I stand by after supporting so many titles, it is this: Do not just build something people can play. Build something people want to be part of. submitted by /u/VRGames4U [link] [comments]",

No one calls Japanese movies Eiga’s and says that Star Wars is a Eiga not a movie because it’s inspired by Japanese movies. It’s weird because video games don’t get this. People place Mario in the same level with American made games like crash Bandicoot. But trying to group in Japanese cartoons with American cartoons would make people mad.

So whenever gaming comes up, he instantly goes into full anti-gaming mode, which puts me in an awkward spot. Meanwhile, my YouTube feed is absolutely cooked. It’s full of videos like “Why you should get a Wii U” and “I modded my Wii U and it was insane.” That’s actually how I found out about the Wii U in the first place, and now I’m lowkey obsessed.

      "content": "Hi everyone, I’m posting here because i genuinely want to understand something and not jump to conclusions. I’m a Moroccan F 21 yo and i met a girl from Algeria once in France. We spent some time together and our relationship developed into something special. After that i had to go back to my home country and our relationship became long-distance. Things were good overall, but lately i’ve been feeling a bit uncomfortable and confused. I’ve noticed that she sometimes sends me messages that feel… indirect or “coded” when it comes to Morocco. Nothing extremely explicit, but enough to make me pause. On top of that, i’ve seen her liking instagram reels posted by algerian pages mocking morocco or moroccans. She never sends those reels to me directly, but seeing her engage with that content hurts, especially knowing i’m moroccan. What i want from you guys is to clarify if this kind of behavior normal or common? Or is it usually a sign of political/national feelings? Or maybe i should just address it directly with her, or am i overthinking it? I care about her, but i also care about mutual respect. I’m not here to start arguments or generalize… I really just want honest perspectives so i can handle this maturely.

      "content": "For a long time (almost 6 months) I’ve been making videos for TikTok about my game. Since I have editing skills, they are of sufficient quality. But I have two big problems. Problem one: Geography . TikTok works region-oriented, and in the region where I live, interest in indie games is very low. That’s why I can only gather very little attention (a maximum of one comment). Problem two: Violence . My game is violent and bloody. Because of that TikTok puts restrictions on me. But when I analyzed, I saw that many bloody games are shared and they get enough audience. I can’t understand why when they share it’s not considered violent, but for me it’s the opposite. Ways I might solve the problem . For the region, I’m considering using VPN, but as far as I know, in that case TikTok sends the video to the wrong places, it seems to leave it in a void. This is a dangerous path (or maybe I don’t know the correct way). For blood, I’m thinking of writing “fake blood” on the video or in the description (I haven’t tested it yet).

Alongside the fact that his in-game performance is top tier, I think more time within the Valorant Competitive scene needs to spent discussing him. We have threads glazing players like Kajaak and Aspas, but where are the threads discussing TenZ? We owe so much to him, and I (personally) believe he's a top 200 player of all time. Possible ideas for threads include: - What would you ask TenZ if you met him in real life? - What do you think TenZ dreams about? - Does TenZ have more aura than LeBron? The lack of respect and attention he gets disgusts me. Without him, pros likely would never be using the Vandal. Maybe even pop-flashes would never exist without him.

When I install an Android app, the installation works well, the icon is inserted correctly, and everything functions without issues. However, when I tap the icon, I see the screen initiating by enlarging and cropping my icon, keeping it either rectangular or circular. What I want is for it to directly open a full-screen image. I want to emphasize that Boot Splash is not the solution because it starts after all of this, without problems. Please don't tell me it's an Android issue, because if I install a game from Google Play, I get the icon, tap it, and a full-screen image opens before the program actually starts. Image 1 shows how the icon is perfectly loaded. As soon as I tap it, a cropped image (not full screen) is activated (see Image 2). https://preview.redd.it/3g4ac3uykmig1.png?width=390&format=png&auto=webp&s=2905381268b48da0886fbe1cdfa06d8a43eca276 image 1 - ok icon https://preview.redd.it/8sf1il31lmig1.png?width=393&format=png&auto=webp&s=828546585148f129231c81064ff8a7aa8df1e325 image 2 - cut icon submitted by /u/Neffolos [link] [comments]",

In other kinds of dev I did in the past (new to gamedev) I'd use libraries as a sort of plug'n'play solution for a problem. Why write custom routing when you can grab a library? Why build your own class for handling 3rd party services when you put a small package in your vendor? What are your favourite plugins and libraries that come out-of-the-box with a customizable solution to a problem? I'm particularly interested in big stuff, comprehensive packages that are almost an engine within the engine. Some things that would be of particular interest to me would be: - grid management - dialogue systems - data management - save / load systems - UI systems submitted by /u/123m4d [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Hi everyone, I’ve been developing my indie game for about 2 years and I’m basically at the “ready to launch” stage. I’m trying to ramp up marketing now, but honestly it’s been harder than I expected. At the moment, I still don’t even have 100 wishlists. So I’m stuck on a big decision: Is it a bad idea to launch with wishlists this low, or should I delay and focus on building them up first? My original goal was split in two: Half: I genuinely want to succeed with this game. Half: I also need this as a strong portfolio piece so I can start job hunting right after launch. Because of that, my plan was to launch first , then immediately begin applying for jobs. But I’ve seen people say things like “you shouldn’t launch until you have 7,000 wishlists,” and now I’m not sure what’s realistic or what the right move is. I’d really appreciate advice from anyone with experience: What are the biggest downsides of launching with very low wishlists? Is delaying usually worth it, or is it better to launch and iterate with updates? If you were in my situation, what would you prioritize right now? Thanks for reading. submitted by /u/OneCoin97 [link] [comments]",

Additionally, we’ve refined the pick up and drop animations for lamps, reusing and adapting work done for the walkie-talkie and flashlight, with the underlying functionality implemented using Unreal Engine’s Gameplay Ability System (GAS).

After that I ported it to mobile, adding touch screen support and different aspect ratio. I've continued developing it with new features and game modes, later released on Steam (Windows and macOS) as standalone entry for free. Yes, you still need to pay 100$ for that. And now I finally published it playable on web (even with mobile browser) so would be happy if you can give it a look a leave a comment.

Now, for every 4 or 5 low driven I attempt, 1 of them will elevate off the floor and into the stands behind the goal. Has anyone else experienced this?

Do you know if he’s generally okay with that kind of thing? He comes across as pretty grounded and self-aware, but I didn’t want to project or assume intent where there isn’t any. Context: we’re testing influencer-inspired NPC archetypes in our game. Nothing named, nothing explicit. Just feeling out where people think the invisible line sits.

      "content": "I love game dev. I love doing it. I’m self taught, and have been trying to learn and release a game for ten years now. I know a lot and I am so unbelievably passionate about game development. But here’s the kicker. Time. I work my day job in construction to pay the bills, and most days, I am at best not happy. All I think about is finally getting home and being able to work on my game. So I spend every last bit of free time I have after work, working on the game so I can get it done. But in this process, I’m slowly losing the people I care about most. My friends, family, they invite me to do things, and I blow it off because I just want to work on my game and get it done. And I tell myself that if I can just get this game done, I can finally be happy. If I can quit my job working construction, I’ll have made it. But is it worth it at all, if by the time I get the game done, I’ve lost the people I care about most? Even if I was successful in the space, made a million bucks, what would I have lost along the way? I feel like I either have to quit game dev, and be stuck at a job I can’t stand, or I put my nose to the grind stone, lose all the people I love, and by the time the game is done, I will have no one to share it with. Was it worth it? To the people around me, it looks like I’m just wasting my time, and blowing everyone off. But man I just want to get this done so I can maybe leave a job working construction, that I hate. But I gotta pay the bills and keep the lights on. People say gaming is a waste of time, and only broke 30 year olds in their mom’s basement play games anymore. But I disagree. I think it is the ultimate medium for story telling. And that’s what makes me so passionate about it. It’s the stories we can tell through the gaming space. This is just me ranting, hopefully I get some insight from experienced devs, because honestly, these options freakin suck. Thank you for listening to me rant Sincerely, Scoobystockbroker submitted by /u/scoobystockbroker [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Some 3d asset devs are adding support for some of their packs to Godot now a days including Learts Cosmos, Animpic, Synty. But at the end of the day Godot has Unity importers which make it easy to import Unity scenes and prefabs, so it's not really a big deal if 3d assets are natively added. The real problem is that Godot has no Asset Store and Game kits, Code Assets, Plugins, VFX, etc assets are usually MIT on Github and there are very few of them and another problem is that these are abandoned in a lot of cases if the dev runs out of motivation. I think Fab.com could fill that gap. And Godot doesn't even compete with Unreal and it's a Blue Ocean unlike with Unity Assets where they have to compete with Unity Asset Store. They could just make a plugin for Fab.com for Godot or just make them downloadable if they're being lazy. I rely heavily on code assets on Unity and Unreal and am reluctant to use Godot because of not having assets. Fingers crossed. submitted by /u/Okklay [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Like, add in customizable loadouts instead of annoying random weapon switchouts every round. Some people just want to play with a specific weapon throughout the whole horde mode encounter. Add in features that were found in Side Order DLC with those mods to change up the gameplay, but for a co-op experience. More consistent and streamlined encounters with bosses, rather than accumulating a bar before you can fight them. Most players cheese the system to play rounds and throw it on purpose. It kinda makes the game feel like a chore. A revive lives system instead of relying on your crew, especially if you are Solo Q with a bunch of randoms with poor skill, because one doesn't have friends to play the game with. A gameplay mode where you have to survive encounter after encounter with more and more relentless enemies, and see how far in the rounds you can get before your whole team wipes. I just want more variety and customizability in this game, especially for Salmon Run; it feels very lacking in potential, to be honest. submitted by /u/levyjl1988 to r/splatoon [link] [comments]",

Compared to the new ST Salah, the old one has Dribbling +5, Tight Possession +2, Low Pass +2, and Stamina +3—plus a 3-star Weak Foot. Meanwhile, the new ST version only has a 2-star Weak Foot. His only advantages are Finishing +3 and Curl +4, along with a 'Blitz Curler' (Epic/Big Time skill). I have to ask: does the dev team overrate the value of 'Blitz Curler' in players' hearts?. As for the actual gameplay experience— https://reddit.com/link/1r15xbl/video/kz67beb24pig1/player Salah's in-game feel is quite strange. Personally, I’ve never felt he was top-tier. Players like Salah, Cruyff, and Rivaldo all belong to that category where their stats suggest their dribbling and ball control should be buttery smooth, but once you actually use them, the feel just doesn't meet expectations. This latest experience was no different. I’d describe his dribbling style as prioritizing 'pivoting/turning,' yet it isn't elite. However, his advantage lies in his player model—with 'Shoulder Width: 10' and 'Leg Length: 9,' he can actually shield the ball quite well with his back to defenders. From there, you can cut inside and trigger that 'Blitz Curler'. The verdict from the Pro ranks is that he is completely inferior to the Big Time (BT) version. https://preview.redd.it/51j5zkpi2pig1.png?width=933&format=png&auto=webp&s=962e8a5092d489e349422471eb23aa9b025d8ff5 Pro Group Feedback— https://preview.redd.it/b48hg5j23pig1.png?width=753&format=png&auto=webp&s=4517b5081326d6cade09159247e38e68db2ad875 The median rating from the Professional Group did not make the top ten.

      "content": "Been playing some Subnautica lately so I've been thinking about inventory management. That is, I've been trying to reconcile if the time spent in menus finding crafting recipes, managing inventory or checking where I left that one crafting ingredient I need either contributes towards or disrupts my immersion. On the one hand, in makes sense that IRL, you can only carry so much and equally in games, it's expected that the resources you collect aren't meant to be hoarded indefinitely - they're supposed to be consumed so you can explore further, and collect even more resources. Once the inventory is full, that's the sign to stop exploring or mining and get back to crafting. However, I find that a game like Subnautica or Minecraft, the appeal is more in the exploring than in the crafting. You don't need to learn any additional mechanics in order to know how things fit together - just as long as you have a recipe and/or all the right ingredients, you can cook up anything you might need, just like magic. So I suppose I'm just wondering if there's anything more these games could be doing to reduce the work it takes to do inventory management, or if I've got this wrong and this is actually what these games need to make the other half of the gameplay loop feel rewarding. submitted by /u/EvilBritishGuy [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Most meme coins follow the same script: launch → hype → excuses → silence. We’re trying to change that narrative, even if we do it with snacks in our hands. $PHAT is a Planet Fitness parody , a gym where: • you don’t get kicked out for being fat • you don’t need motivation quotes • you don’t have to pretend you’re fit Just vibes, food, and consistency. Why we’re serious about changing the narrative: • 🔒 50% of our TEAM supply is locked Not “soon”, not “trust us”, already done. • 🍪 Snack bot gives rewards every day — even if you’re not a holder No gatekeeping. Hang out, play, eat. • 🎮 Contests coming next week (games + community stuff) • 🎥 Going live on pump.fun and TikTok Building in public instead of hiding behind announcements We’re not here to promise 100x. We’re here to build something people actually enjoy being part of. If you’re tired of: • recycled roadmaps • devs who disappear after launch • “utility coming soon” …then yeah, this gym might be for you. Come sit on the bench. Grab a snack. Lift bags if you want.

      "content": "I’ve been messing around with the idea of a roguelike custom game for Rematch, and I finally got it to a point where it’s actually playable using only in-game mechanics. The basic idea: You start with almost nothing. No sprinting, no shooting, no dribbling, no minimap, and default/bad camera settings. to start you will randomly roll for your \"class\". After each match, every player rolls for a random unlock. There are: Button-based unlocks Settings unlocks (minimap, FOV, camera shake) Rare and legendary rolls A “god roll\" that turns a player fully unrestricted Optional curses you can take for bonus rolls (worse camera, no back passes, or limited sprinting) This is still a work in progress but the games we have played have been really fun! Think of this as a beta version 0.1. If you try it with your group, I’d really like to hear how it goes.

EOS has proper lobby support, but I’m worried about: Is it actually production-ready in 2026? I intend to ship on Steam, but everything still goes through Epic with EOS. Bad idea? Does Steam basically become just auth while Epic handles the rest? Do the social features of Steam break? Any real-world friction publishing on Steam while using EOS? Hoping to get some feedback from people with real experience: If you were starting today, would you: Stick with OSS + workarounds? Or go EOS for cleaner architecture?

A ima stvarno filmova koje sam pogledao više puta nego želim ni priznati. submitted by /u/Fiuman_1987 to r/askCroatians [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Hi everyone, I'm a solo dev working on a UE5 horror project called FINIS ACTUS. Yesterday, I experienced my first \"mini-viral\" moment and I wanted to share the data and my takeaways with this community. Atmosphere over UI: I shared a raw, high-contrast screenshot focusing on \"oppressive darkness.\" It sparked a massive debate about visibility vs. immersion (over 6 comments and 4 shares within hours). Hooky Title: I didn't say \"Buy my game.\" I talked about the struggle of making darkness feel \"heavy.\" Engagement: I replied to almost every comment, especially the ones criticizing the \"too dark\" look. This kept the post in the \"Hot\" section for 12+ hours. What I Learned: Don't oversell in the title: Reddit hates marketing speak. Be ready for the \"Processing Lag\": External traffic takes time to reflect on Steam/IndieDB dashboards. The \"Too Dark\" Controversy: Polarizing content (is it too dark or just right?) actually drives more engagement than \"perfect\" content. I’m curious, have you guys experienced a similar spike from non-gaming subreddits? How did your conversion rates look? submitted by /u/Think-Ear6167 [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Hi everyone, I'm a solo dev working on a UE5 horror project called FINIS ACTUS. Yesterday, I experienced my first \"mini-viral\" moment and I wanted to share the data and my takeaways with this community. Atmosphere over UI: I shared a raw, high-contrast screenshot focusing on \"oppressive darkness.\" It sparked a massive debate about visibility vs. immersion (over 6 comments and 4 shares within hours). Hooky Title: I didn't say \"Buy my game.\" I talked about the struggle of making darkness feel \"heavy.\" Engagement: I replied to almost every comment, especially the ones criticizing the \"too dark\" look. This kept the post in the \"Hot\" section for 12+ hours. What I Learned: Don't oversell in the title: Reddit hates marketing speak. Be ready for the \"Processing Lag\": External traffic takes time to reflect on Steam/IndieDB dashboards. The \"Too Dark\" Controversy: Polarizing content (is it too dark or just right?) actually drives more engagement than \"perfect\" content. I’m curious, have you guys experienced a similar spike from non-gaming subreddits? How did your conversion rates look? submitted by /u/Think-Ear6167 to r/gamedev [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Just a friendly reminder that you want to make the most of the visibility Steam gives you during Next Fest, which includes making sure Steam is showing your game to players who like that kind of game. And that means making sure your tags are good. If the games showing up in the “More Like This” section of your Steam page really are similar to your game, you’re good to go. If not, find games like yours and copy their tags. The site steamtaghelper.com is a utility where you can enter up to 3 other games and it will tell you the common tags. Also, standard Chris Zukowski advice: don’t use “casual” or “indie” as tags; they really don’t help. Good luck to all you Next Festers! submitted by /u/PersonOfInterest007 [link] [comments]",

Exteriors: Fishing spot at the bow, Diving Rack/Ladder, and a slot for the legendary \"Yumbo\" Crane. Note on the Yumbo: It's an optional upgrade players have to purchase to handle heavier loads.

Heres a screenshot of the glitch: https://imgur.com/a/mWcaS8e However, as soon as I hit ESC and open the pause menu, the screen looks perfectly fine .

      "content": "I was wondering if anyone had any sort of solution to the problem I am having where every time I (try) launch Helldivers the following happens: When ever I open the steam page it flashes black for a second Launching the game always causes Game Guard N Protect to start before it presents me with error code 340. The game won't shut down even if it never launched, after I get 340'd the game still thinks its running and attempting to shut it down leads to a infinite stopping icon preventing me from relaunching the game. This is fixed by completely shutting down steam. Game \"crashes\" as in it just turns off, no error, no please report what happened, just off. I have tried everything to fix this with only some temporary solutions being ones that I have found to even slightly work. Temporary in this case meaning I can launch the game once, and only once before the cycle repeats. Also shutting the game down here brings back issue 3 of it not actually shutting down. Fixes I have tried: - Uninstall and Reinstall - Delete Game guards Folder and force it to reinstall itself - Delete Game guards Folder and make steam reinstall it - Give Game guard complete and total access to every file with no firewalls, it already does this I just made it even easier for it - Sacrifice a goat - Move all files onto a local disk - Run game as administrator - Run game guard as administrator None of these worked, at best the game launches once before I have to restart the process. If anyone has any ideas or has had this issue and solved it I would greatly appreciate it. I don't really want to miss out on Cyberstan just because the anticheat system decided the defecting to the enemy was a good idea. submitted by /u/Future-Relative3762 to r/Helldivers [link] [comments]",

So before the fight starts you are given an pre fight menu which gives you a few opinions to choose from, 1. If you chose the talk opinion you can say or do something that will apply a states affect to your opponent that could either benefit you or your opponent, 2. If you choose the item opinions you can equip or use an item you have, 3. If you pick the power/skills you can equip different abilities and skills to this fight, 4. If you pick the check opinion you can see your opponent's character card with lots of info about your opponent including strengths and weaknesses, some information is wrong, 5. And finally if you have a party with you get a call opinion which allows you to switch with one of your party members. After you pick an option you get throw into battle which works as an fighting game, depending on how many rounds the battle has you get a mid-fight and final fight menu.

If you choose the item opinions you can equip or use an item you have, 3. If you pick the power/skills you can equip different abilities and skills to this fight, 4. If you pick the check opinion you can see your opponent's character card with lots of info about your opponent including strengths and weaknesses, some information is wrong, 5. And finally if you have a party with you get a call opinion which allows you to switch with one of your party members. After you pick an option you get throw into battle which works as an fighting game, depending on how many rounds the battle has you get a mid-fight and final fight menu. So that's my idea for now if you have some feedback or unique ideas for an rpg combat system let me know submitted by /u/Unusual-Two2972 [link] [comments]",

Thankfully, now it doesn't crash the engine, but when I activate VR Preview for the 2nd time, the preview window slows down and I can't see anything in the headset but I can hear the in-game audio. So one huge problem has been solved only to be replaced by another. My previous solution was to roll SteamVR drivers back to pre-December 2025 and that works amazingly well no issues but it is not a long term solution so I am asking if anyone has this problem and found a fix for it. submitted by /u/RickSpawn147 [link] [comments]",

We’re currently working on a narrative-driven indie game focused on atmosphere, character interaction, and slow-burn storytelling. The project is still in development, but we already have a playable demo and are actively iterating based on player feedback. As a small team, we’re doing everything ourselves — game design, writing, visuals, and community management — and we’re still learning a lot along the way. We joined Reddit because we really value discussions around indie development, storytelling in games, and learning from other devs’ experiences. We’d love to hear your thoughts, questions, or advice — especially if you’ve worked on or enjoy narrative-heavy indie games. https://preview.redd.it/2eqzmd02urig1.png?width=184&format=png&auto=webp&s=d6bef96d00a879debc69442df13d34e6bc4ab54a Thanks for having us here 🙏 submitted by /u/Known-Mall5253 [link] [comments]",

We’re currently working on a narrative-driven indie game focused on atmosphere, character interaction, and slow-burn storytelling. The project is still in development, but we already have a playable demo and are actively iterating based on player feedback. As a small team, we’re doing everything ourselves — game design, writing, visuals, and community management — and we’re still learning a lot along the way. We joined Reddit because we really value discussions around indie development, storytelling in games, and learning from other devs’ experiences. We’d love to hear your thoughts, questions, or advice — especially if you’ve worked on or enjoy narrative-heavy indie games. https://preview.redd.it/2eqzmd02urig1.png?width=184&format=png&auto=webp&s=d6bef96d00a879debc69442df13d34e6bc4ab54a Thanks for having us here 🙏 submitted by /u/Known-Mall5253 to r/IndieDev [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Hey folks, I made a post the other day essentially asking if I was running too many mods, because I couldn't walk through downtown Boston for more than a minute or two before the game would crash. I understood that there was only so much that anyone could tell me without seeing my load order, and the game's obviously a bit buggy anyway, so it may not matter, but I finally got around to getting photos of my load order . I had to do it through photos on my phone, unfortunately; every time I hit the screen grab button, it just tab-alt'd me out of the game window. At any rate, if any kind, virtuous, altruistic, and wise soul happens upon this, I'd appreciate if you could let me know if anything in my load order is flagrantly out of whack. Is there anything that should be at the bottom, or the top, that isn't? Is there anything in there that you know to be out of date and un-updated? Any other problems jump out at you?

      "content": "I'm having a weird issue with the editor crashing right now. So I've created a Resource, which is pretty much meant to work kinda like Pokemon types do, where it has exported arrays that take more types, indicating which other types it's weak or resistant to - so when I create a new one I can inspect it in the editor and select the other types it's weak to/resists, which is pretty neat. Everything works flawlessly, until I try to make a type resist or be weak to itself - the moment I select the type in the editor, BAM, instant crash to desktop. Every single time, 100% of the time. I tried creating a new project just to test this and yep, it happens there too - all I did was make a resource that has an exported array of other resources of the same class, create a new instance of that resource, and then try to put it in the array in the editor. Still crashes. Notably, creating a second instance of that resource and putting that in the array of the first works totally fine. If I create a type that is weak to or resists other types but not itself, everything works fine and there's no crash, but the moment I try to add the same type as itself to one of the arrays, instant crash.

I have one concern about the atmosphere of the game, I feel like something is missing and I don't know if it's graphics or sound design related (maybe both). I have the feeling that something is missing and despite the art of the game beeing very good, there is something a bit soulless. Do you have the same feeling and do you know if something is on the table to fix that ? Adding more and better sound design (footstep or wind for example) Adding more fog, wind effect ?

      "content": "Hi everyone, I need clarification regarding App Store / Play Store payment policies. Context We run: • a web platform that allows users to register for videogame tournaments • a mobile app that offers the same functionality Users pay an entry fee to participate in tournaments. To avoid store commissions, we are considering allowing payments only via our website, and not inside the mobile app. Question Is it compliant with Apple / Google policies to: • Allow users to register to tournaments from the mobile app • But require the payment of the entry fee to be completed on our website • Without offering in-app purchases inside the app We would not explicitly redirect users with a payment link (if that’s not allowed), but simply inform them that payment must be completed on the website. Has anyone implemented a similar structure? Are tournament entry fees considered digital goods/services under store policies? Any real-world experience or policy references would be greatly appreciated. Thanks! submitted by /u/Mepetee [link] [comments]",

However, when I try to launch it on X11 (Gnome or Xfce), my desktop freezes as soon as the actual game starts, i.e. after the Rockstar launcher part. Weirdly, I am able to switch to GDM by pressing Ctrl-Alt-F1, log back in and the desktop will then unfreeze itself - the game is still running, it even recovers sometimes and I can then play it (although not every time). Other games work the same on X11 as they do on Wayland, so it's something pretty specific to GTA, I think. I tried a few things to fix it, but nothing works: Disabled Steam in-game overlay (FPS indicator) Various Proton and Proton-GE versions (including the most recent GE 10-30) SteamDeck=1 launch option Disabled compositor on Xfce Anyone else experienced something like this and maybe know a fix?

Getting early feedback is important to me but I think horror games are kind of in a weird position for this because environment, lighting, and sound design are so critical it feels like a waste to ask for feedback on anything but an almost finished demo, but then by that point it’s almost too late if the idea doesn’t resonate or something else doesn’t quite work. It also seems challenging because the most genuine reaction to what you’ve made will most likely be the first time someone experiences it and if your testers go through the same sequence 45 times they know exactly what to expect and are probably so desensitized to it that it’s not even remotely scary or unsettling anymore. submitted by /u/Gwab_ [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Prerequisite step: Have multiple nodes in a scene with each node having exported variables. Steps: Run the scene, then go to run time debug on the left hand side of the Godot editor. Select one node in the runtime debug section You will see the current node's exported variables reflected in the inspector. Then change to another node in the same scene with its own set of exported variables in the run time section The right side of the editor (the inspector) will change to reflect the new selected node. However if you repeat steps 2-5 with other nodes in the scene in the current run session, the inspector eventually stops displaying the updated exported variables for the currently selected node. Is this a known issue or is there something from my end? Is there a workaround? submitted by /u/mrrahulkurup [link] [comments]",

      "content": "My game has four acts. In act 1 the player gets weak cards, and the cards he gets is stronger in each subsequent act. He can also upgrade cards but that's beside the point I think. The question: should there be much more cards for Act 1 than Act 4 ? Because if there are equal cards in all acts then act 1 cards get played more often so I might need more variety. The alternative is reducing act 4 card pool but then Act 4 itself has little variety. So I feel forced to go with increasing the Act 1 pool but that leads to scope increase. Not sure what to do. Are there any games that work like this? submitted by /u/RobbertGone [link] [comments]",

Listen ik we say FSR4 is a big improvement but in battlefield 6 it is DLSS level. Ultra performance at 1440p LOOKS LIKE 1080P. If you have used fsr3 at 1440p yk the vaseline covered hallucinatory nigtmare that is. Replace the circled files with the OFFICAL versions from the FidelityFX-SDK-2.1.0 then put the INT8 version. I used the SDK from AMD's website and the INT8 from my witches cauldron. Likeliness of getting banned for this is low as your are using OFFICALLY signed AMD SDK and if this was flagged as a threat the game hopefully like every other anti cheat on the planet; would just refuse to open. However the game opens without a hiccup, recompiles the shaders and you are golden. Of course, everything is at your own risk but da da needs sharpness. submitted by /u/TardisTG to r/radeon [link] [comments]",

That way she could've boasted about her solving the issue and also leavingenough money for the others, win-win, and they wouldn't have been mad about her selling the coin, cause it left some money for everybody. She still would've been a 'hero'. Another issue with not telling them now is the coin toss obviously, how will she confess to selling it? It would make her more vulnerable in the finale, if it came out that she lied. However, maybe she could get away with telling people, that she sold it at some random point in time, when noone was around. All of that made me think that telling the others was a better move. Considering the current game though, I changed my mind. If she had told everybody, then she would've been voted out in this game, because \"she already has 500k\".

      "content": "Hi, I am currently working on my Bachelor’s thesis on visibility algorithms in the context of video games. Specifically, I am interested in the case of having many actors in a scene and the challenge of calculating which ones can see each other (so not just the calculation of the visibility polygon for a single viewpoint). For that, I want to focus on CPU-based algorithms, since visibility is something one might want to calculate on a server in the case of multiplayer games. However, while doing my research on the topic, I realized that I do not really have a good picture of what the common bottlenecks are in this area. It is, of course, a problem I stumbled across while making my own games, which led to my idea for the Bachelor’s thesis, but I assume that many of the problems I solved for myself have already been solved. It also turned out to be very hard to find resources in this area. That’s why I wanted to ask more experienced game developers directly. If you have experience with this or similar problems, what are the common bottlenecks one encounters? What are some open problems I could try to optimize an algorithm for in the context of a Bachelor’s thesis? submitted by /u/emptyArray_79 [link] [comments]",

This is just the beginning. There are thousands of possible locations to explore, and many different races and ships to encounter. I'm open to ideas and suggestions.

The demo is already in beta test and I know in some cases it's better to have it released months before, it's not really the question. I'm wondering if it creates a significant lack of visibility to release the demo in ~5 days or not. And if being ready for the press day 1 is really important for Next Fest or not.

The game is a hidden-object adventure — which I know is a very specific niche. It’s not a genre that tends to go viral, and it rarely gets picked up by big streamers. I’ve been debating internally whether I should consider this number worrying… or simply realistic given the genre. The game is participating in Steam Next Fest, so I’m treating that as the first real visibility test. Until now, growth has been fully organic (no ads, no publisher). For developers working in smaller or quieter genres: • What were your wishlist numbers before your first festival or launch? • Did Next Fest significantly change your trajectory? • At what point did you feel momentum actually started? I’m not panicking — just trying to calibrate expectations in a niche space. submitted by /u/Lucky_Conference78 [link] [comments]",

      "title": "Some thoughts on adding citizen feedback and politics to the game in a way that would be engaging for the player",
      "content": "Hi everyone, sorry about the long post, I just got this down as a stream of consciousness and wanted to start a conversation on potential routes the game could go to increase the involvement the player has with their city. I was thinking about how politics and conflicting interest groups might make it into the game and had a few thoughts on giving citizens more personality which I believe would be a good way of representing this. Citizens are assigned beliefs, needs, wants etc. These are assigned at random, but weighted by probabilities based on age + maybe other characteristics- are they in education? do they have children etc.? These 'wants' influence the happiness impacts of living/working in their local area. For instance, students generally don't mind noise pollution as much, don't mind smaller homes, want nearby amenities. Young families don't like roads with high speed limits near where they live, want nearby schools etc. Personalities can be seen when selecting each individual in your city, but are also aggregated as city or district wide statistics in the form of pressure groups. In these pressure groups the happiness effects of various situations could be multiplied to add a sense of urgency to resolving them. They could even be visible to you through your town hall? This would lead to feedback on what would make the residents of your city happy, and this would change over time. Wants could be reassigned per citizen as they move to the next age level, or based on changes in life situation etc. Where I think this could get interesting is in making districts more impactful. You could try a scattergun approach by using the speed bumps policy for your whole city for example, and this would solve an issue for young families, but it might annoy young professionals who can't get to work on time. Using districts, you could mark out a neighborhood of single-family homes, use the information already provided in the game to get an idea of the demographics, and create a local policy that works for the people living there. I'm unsure if this would mean district boundaries becoming more static or not from a gameplay perspective as you might need to avoid the equivalent of gerrymandering by players, but I am open to ideas. Looking further into what you could do with this, pressure groups might not necessarily have globally optimal solutions in mind, in which case you would need to trade off the benefits of making changes for one group vs leaving things as they are for another. Measures other than policies could also make an impact. Building a highway through a suburb for example should cause an increase in unhappiness for the people living there who don't want to be near busy roads. Zoning commercial and (after future dlc hopefully) nightlife near students would make them happier as it satisfies their want for nearby amenities. Groups could even be specific to a district. A local district group might ask for traffic to be reduced by x% in their neighborhood and give you a time limit to complete this in. There could potentially be rewards for achieving these things. Your country's government sees how happy local people are after your planning decisions and provides funds for a new park for example. Moreover, the relative happiness of different pressure groups might impact who moves into a district (or area? unsure how this would work) leading to cities that act more like real places, with people of different ages, incomes etc living in different areas. This would have the knock on effect of making it easier to intuitively know where various policies make sense. If we were to allow people to join multiple pressure groups this could go even further, people might come to you wanting higher incomes, greener local areas, businesses might ask for more small housing for a cheaper workforce- something directly contradicting another group's want for larger homes and higher wages. This would work well with the random assignment of wants per citizen I talked about earlier. A senior might want to live in a walkable neighborhood but because of RNG might also not care about noise pollution from industry. All of this could be presented as relative pressure group strength or something similar. I'm interested in your thoughts on how these groups would work in practice. Would they go away after their demands have been met? Or continue to impact overall happiness based on their individual wants and needs. Would it be possible to have happiness impact who moves in etc? How many groups would you have? I'd love to hear more thoughts on whether this is all even possible and if it would make the game more interesting for you.

      "content": "Not so lovely pixel bug I have been trying to get full screen pixel art rendering working, and Godot seems really bad at it. Viewport: 256x144 Mode: Exclusive Fullscreen Stretch: canvas_items Scale Mode: fractional --- Rendering Default Texture Filter: Nearest Snap 2D Vertices to Pixel: On Explanation: Fractional seems to allow the game to stretch to fit the screen whereas Integer fits to closest scale (not ideal). Default texture to nearest is so I don't have to edit every texture manually. Snap for vertices fixes scaling errors that Godot just seems to crap out for whatever reason. See below for example. Weird jagged rendering I've checked the node that renders these (TileMapLayer) and there is no slight 0.1 rotation causing this. It happens across the entire screen and I have no idea why. So my question is: What is the best way to render 2D pixel art that avoids the above issues? NOTE: The rendering works perfectly with integer, but has a border I was hoping to avoid. My worst case scenario is just accepting that a lot of resolutions will have a black border around the game. submitted by /u/Trevisplaysreddit [link] [comments]",

Since everywhere I read I see 50% of people saying that it’s better to pick Godot and the other half Unity, which would be better suited for this kind of project? If I have to learn an engine, I really wouldn’t like to start learn one just to switch to the other after some time, that’s why I would pick Unity even if people say it’s harder since I plan to stick with the one best suited for the idea. submitted by /u/hawkeyeninefive [link] [comments]",

      "content": "So on tiktok I post the questions on social media with the call to action - “Play today’s trivia to see the answer”. Every so often these posts get a lot of traction - hundreds of comments, 100k+ views, lots of shares, etc. however, when a tiktok is spiking and I look at the live site traffic to see if there is any discernible jump, there’s virtually nothing. I estimate that a 100k TikTok post results in less than ten actual visitors. Reddit is a completely different story. One reddit post got 3k views and led to 220 new users within two hours. 7.5% conversion compared to TikTok. Now, what did these Reddit users engagement metrics look like? A good chunk came once and never returned, but around 20% came back at least one subsequent day.

HE HAS A FUCKING BIG ASS SWORD IN HIS HAND. It makes absolutely no sense…. it may as well be a wet pool noodle. (Actually would be a hilariously appropriate idea for a summer pool skin). My mind just has a very hard time imagining a support having stronger auto attack than a 5 foot flaming sword slashing right through you. submitted by /u/Is0prene to r/MobileLegendsGame [link] [comments]",

I just want to do this in the x-axis. I attached a little video of what I am talking about. Currently it is just a parallax, and when I go far the effect wears off.

If accepted, the most likely result will be Marmara University, Istanbul or Ankara University, Ankara for a PhD in Turkish Language / Linguistics. It would really be a dream come true to be funded to continue studying in-country. The TürkiyeBursları Scheme offers 9000TL/month stipend. Everything else, such as Tuition, Accommodation, etc. are covered for four years. How does that pan out in terms of living costs? I know Türkiye has become much more expensive than before, but is it enough to survive on 9000TL without any more income? Will inflation make staying with that amount impossible in years to come? Also, any comparisons of Marmara University vs. Ankara University would be gratefully received. I’m worried Ankara will be super boring compared to Istanbul, but the university is actually better.

      "content": "Hi, As a healer, I feel there’s a unique bond of competition and mutual respect in the Arena. It’s a completely different vibe compared to the relationship between DPS players; we’re both in the trenches, often facing the same struggles. Because of this, I often want to message the opposing healer once the arena is closed...maybe to say \"good job\" or to ask for feedback on what I did right or wrong. The problem is that the game often makes this impossible. In many of my sessions, the enemy healer doesn't even show up in the \"Recently Played With\" list or the social tab. It feels like there's a barrier preventing us from connecting. I don’t know if it’s just a bug or a design choice, but it’s frustrating because that post-match chat with a \"colleague\" is where the best learning happens. Does anyone else experience this? It feels like a missed opportunity for the healer community to grow together. submitted by /u/HouseLongjumping6984 to r/worldofpvp [link] [comments]",

It has not been as bad for me since this season and ive played every season from day one. I have also never made a post about this because ive always felt that its difficult to balance correctly but this is insane and just makes playing the game absolutely horrendous, and then im not even speaking about the dropship changes.

I've been playing Career Mode since 2011, and I've always liked to set the difficulty to a challenging level so that the big teams pose a challenge and the smaller/mid-sized teams punish any bad decisions or plays. Four days ago, I bought EA FC 26 on sale, and when I tried to play a league match with Barcelona, ​​I found the games quite difficult, even though FC 25 had the same difficulty. It's gotten to the point where smaller teams make me sweat because their defense is crazy; it's like they're reading my mind. They not only anticipate my moves but also steal the ball with surgical precision. And don't even get me started on the goalkeepers. The Oviedo goalkeeper saves rockets from Lamine, Yamal, and Lewandowski like he's Buffon Prime—it's ridiculous. But if I lower the difficulty to Professional, it's a walk in the park. I understand this also happened at the beginning of FC 25. Can anyone confirm this? submitted by /u/Noveluum to r/FifaCareers [link] [comments]",

The app gamifies your progress across 5 pillars: Discipline, Focus, Recovery, Physique, Wisdom. You complete tasks, you level up. The grind becomes a game. Two features people use the most: - Win logging: When motivation crashes, you have proof you've done hard things before - Distraction mode: Once you start drifting it snaps you back This is V1.

Combat is inspired by classic RE - you can either move or attack, never both and you need to account for this in every encounter. This makes combat less about twitch reflexes and more about tactics, positioning and using the right combination of weapons and items. It still has some of the survival horror DNA: a lot of combat encounters can be avoided and player has to manage their resources carefully and efficiently.

I think it's because I'm switching the base static mesh on the fly rather than pre-loading everything. This requires further investigation but for now I'm pretty happy with it even with the jank. Now the gameplay is much more congruent with the story because the mission description includes protecting the equipment from worm damage. Also goes in line with the game being basically a modernized version of space invaders, where the aliens slowly chip away at your 'bases'. I was trying to fade the destroyed pieces out, but the fade out timeline is currently being applied to each building's instance at the same time. So when one building's pieces fade out, if the building next to it is also exploding the pieces will fade out at the same time as the first building so it looks off. For now I just remove the pieces after a few seconds. If you're interested in more, check out the Steam Page! submitted by /u/dread_companion [link] [comments]",

Idle and walking animations work fine with no distortion. What I’ve checked: No scale keyframes in the animation The issue does not appear on this rig or character in Blender. Same rig and model. Additional context: The run animation originally looked like it was playing in slow motion in Unity, so I increased the animation speed to make it look natural. Although it looks ridiculously hilarious, it's not quite what I'm going for this game lol.

I really don’t want to stick point lights everywhere or ramp up Lumen samples. Is there a performant way round this. Exposure is not the answer as it messes up the outside areas.

And before anyone says, no I don't believe taxpayer money should be funding an Oled TV with a PS5, that would be only for those inmates that have someone on the outside willing to fully fund it. For the others much cheaper board games, then state could fund a few cheap ones. Remember that one day, they'll get out and will have to get reintegrated into society.

However, I feel like that hasn't been the case for a long time now. The Brute Spawning Massacre of 2024 that wrecked many villages across multiple dimensions should've been the sign to make quality gameplay the priority. Yes, we were asking for more content but not content that would cost us in quality. I love the Storm, Lost Isles and Ninjago, but I shouldn't still have the same rubberbanding/lag issues that I had 2 years ago. I shouldn't have to run into wild glitches every single update. In my opinion, we now have enough content where we can now prioritize cleaning up gameplay over all else. I think they should put ALL the Lego items in the shop for us while devs focus solely on fixing the game until its a well-oiled machine. Then, bring us quality content!

      "content": "I have a tree FBX and a PNG for a mesh. I tried creating a staticbody3d, but it says \"Cant find any files\" when I click the mesh in the inspector. So I guess Im confused - if I cant create a staticbody3d and add the Tree FBX as the mesh, how do I put a tree in a level and attach the mesh with material? When I double click the FBX, the mesh is there, but the material is empty - which I understand Id need to add the PNG to the material, but it doesnt even let me do that. Any guidance would be appreciated. Thank you Edit: So basically Im clicking the FBX, Reimporting and allowing the material to be External, updating the material, creating a new scene, placing the FBX in the scene and assigning the material that way? Maybe Im just used to Unreal, but there has to be a more efficient way to do this?? submitted by /u/Siden-The-Paladin [link] [comments]",

This assumes they follow the optimal game progression, where they are identical mid-game blue hives until one switches at level 20. IMO, how I think it'll go is blue hives have gradually better hourlies while red hives slow down heavily from the resources needed to switch color, then given enough time red hives soar past blues in total honey production. Also, I'd guess it's hard to measure effort when blue hives live and breathe macroing. This also leads me to ask how a white hive progression would differ... P.S. Apologies if this question is too technical. I ask this question because I'm having trouble deciding whether to switch colors, but maybe I should focus more on how I want to play the game instead submitted by /u/MealRevolutionary876 to r/BeeSwarmSimulator [link] [comments]",

      "content": "I made caustics for my water shader so here's how it works: What it basically does is calculate the world position from the depth texture, uses that to sample a caustics texture then mixes that with the screen texture. To start we need a few uniforms. To get the screen texture or the depth texture you can use hint_depth_texture and hint_screen_texture . shader_type spatial; uniform sampler2D depth_texture : hint_depth_texture; uniform sampler2D screen_texture : hint_screen_texture; uniform sampler2D caustics_texture; uniform float caustics_strength = 2.0; uniform vec2 caustics_scale = vec2(0.5); Here caustics_texture is the texture we will map to the world (remember to set that in the editor). caustics_strenght and caustics_scale are pretty obvious. They're optional but help out a lot. Now the important stuff: getting the coordinates to map the texture onto. What this basically does is it expects SCREEN_UV , INV_PROJECTION_MATRIX and INV_VIEW_MATRIX to basically go through in the image here in reverse until we have world space coordinates. vec4 sample_world_dpos(vec2 screen_uv, mat4 inv_projection_matrix, mat4 inv_view_matrix){ vec4 clip_pos = vec4(screen_uv * 2.0 - 1.0, texture(depth_texture, screen_uv).r, 1.0); vec4 view_pos = inv_projection_matrix * clip_pos; view_pos /= view_pos.w; vec4 world_dpos = inv_view_matrix * view_pos; return world_dpos; } Here we calculate clip space coordinates: vec4 clip_pos = vec4(screen_uv * 2.0 - 1.0, texture(depth_texture, screen_uv).r, 1.0); Then we use that to reconstruct view space coordinates with the inverse projection matrix: vec4 view_pos = inv_projection_matrix * clip_pos; view_pos /= view_pos.w; Then finally we reconstruct world space coordinates using the inverse view matrix: vec4 world_dpos = inv_view_matrix * view_pos; return world_dpos Then within the fragment we can get the world position and use its xz axes as the uv coordinates (multiplied by scale) for the caustics texture. Then we sample the screen texture, and finally simply add the caustics (multiplied by strength) to the screen void fragment(){ vec4 world_dpos = sample_world_dpos(SCREEN_UV, INV_PROJECTION_MATRIX, INV_VIEW_MATRIX); vec4 caustics = texture(caustics_texture, world_dpos.xz * caustics_scale).rgba; vec4 screen = texture(screen_texture, SCREEN_UV); ALBEDO = screen.rgb + (caustics.rgb * caustics_strenght); } I hope I was clear, this is my first time writing anything like this.

I wanted to build a RPG, I decided it would be best to make smaller games and projects centered around each of the core systems I have in mind. But that’s led me to questions I’ve never thought about before. In shows and movies we see video games where characters are winged humanoids, Goliaths, or anatomical complex creatures. Why exactly don’t we get that slot in real life? For example let’s say the animes Shangri-La Frontier or Overlord. Like why couldn’t there be a a Elden Ring 2 with some of the bosses as inspiration for player models? submitted by /u/Parking-Wonder8240 [link] [comments]",

The kāmancheh has been played and tuned in such a way that it sounds reminiscent of Scandinavian string instruments.

      "content": "https://reddit.com/link/1r36jz5/video/1o0ksj70s4jg1/player I'm trying to blend between a walk cycle and a run cycle in my AnimationTree. Naturally, the walk cycle (1.0s) is longer than the run cycle (0.5s), but annoyingly, it seems the BlendSpace doesn't blend the animations proportionally. So it blends walk at 0.5s with run at 0.5s instead of run at 0.25s. What this means is that at 0.5s, walk wants the right foot ahead, but run wants the left foot ahead, resulting in this awkward out-of-phase tripping animation you see in the video. How are you meant to blend two animations of different lengths and keep them in-phase? So far the only workaround is to export run as a 1.0s animation (so twice as slow as it's meant to be) then link the BlendSpace output into a TimeScale node and modify that accordingly in the script. It works but it's not ideal - it's a bit hacky and annoying to set up for each blend tree I have in my scene. The \"sync\" option also doesn't seem to change anything. From what I understand in the docs, it just makes sure to advance animations in the background when the BlendSpace value is 0. I've also made sure that the walk and run cycles start and end at the same phase (in this case, the left foot sticking out). I also saw this solution online, but was just wondering if there's a less cumbersome way to do it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D8oUhyxXG4 submitted by /u/struugi [link] [comments]",

If you collect some cool stuff like a normal person and keep it in great condition and you happen to make some money off of it then great, but for the love of God please just give people an equal chance to enjoy the hobby. The fact that Pokémon websites have to ban THOUSANDS of bots that are ran by scalpers is atrocious, pathetic, and outright ridiculous.

So far, SwitchUp has shown that the game runs uncapped somewhere between 30 and 40 FPS (why the devs are so set on leaving the framerate uncapped for the series on console, I have no idea), while Froz3n (for those who speak Italian) does not mention exact numbers but says that the game runs well and is extremely enjoyable on Switch 2, if with some small compromises compared to PC/PS5. Overall, Stories 3 seems to run on Switch 2 like Stories 2 ran on Switch 1 - uncapped, somewhere slightly above 30FPS, and enjoyable but for some hiccups. I wish the game let us choose between performance and quality options, or at least offered a toggle to cap the framerate to 30, but it should still be an amazing time for those of us who prefer playing on a handheld console. submitted by /u/Jooles95 to r/MonsterHunterStories [link] [comments]",

      "content": "First time posting here. I’m overemployed but in separate industries. I’m a SWE with 5 YOE and 7 YOE in sales (separate industries, separate resumes, tech doesn’t know about sales). Tech is my passion, sales is stable money. I’ve quit two toxic tech jobs (most recently after 6 months), and I’m worried the short stint is hurting my chances, especially since most open roles are senior and I haven’t officially held that title. Previously I freelanced to fill resume gaps, but I don’t want to do that anymore as I can make more in sales. So I’m considering stretching dates or adjusting my story to stay competitive, but ultimately I’m just a qualified SWE trying to land a healthy, senior-level role without being penalized for leaving bad environments. I’m new to the overemployed movement and job hunting with this mindset for the first time. Obviously I know I need to make sure my LinkedIn / online profiles match. But what else should I consider when lying? To be frank, I don’t have much to lose in tech, so I’m willing to be more shameless about it. submitted by /u/Sudden_Silver2095 to r/overemployed [link] [comments]",

If anyone has some planing related problems, can give advice, since I mostly work in projects. If somethings works - do not rewrite it to be better. Leave that for later when you need to optimize. The first solution will let you see how things work. You can write conversion skripts later if you need to migrate data, so do not stress the curent structures. Forcing solutions is not good, because you suffer yourself. There are multiple things to focus on, so you can change your focus and it can help.

I made a city system based of districts and growing and declining population of the city, also the culture plays a part in the city as people of different cultures migrate to the city the cultures blend as the do in real life. The combat has a bunch of different classes to recruit from(different cultures different units,almost like bannerlord). Each culture has its own tech tree that unlike most mobile games is not handled by the individual but by the empire of players. The skill tree is set up that you need points to boost the cap and points are limited so not one man can rule all. Empires will need to have several different people specializing in each field to run the empire. My goal is to make politics as most empires had with real power struggles unlike other games were one controls all and it’s forced. The more power a person has ether in the economy or the military the more power they have in politics. I am a high school student solo developing this game if anyone has any questions or wants to help I’ll happily add up to the discord. submitted by /u/Professional-Log482 [link] [comments]",

Steps I am currently doing: 1. Added some sample objects to a subviewport (sprite, emitter, color rect) Created a new sprite which is using a textureviewport that is assigned to the previously created viewport. Applying a shader material to the sprite I have tried with various shaders, and done enough work with basic shaders to feel that the problem is not with the shaders. It currently seems like the shader is just being ignored. Questions: What is the correct way to use a shader and viewport texture? Can you use viewports with an emitter inside them, and apply a shader to this (e.g to make cell shaded smoke affect)? submitted by /u/Creator- [link] [comments]",

It would then get worse and couldn’t open browsers without instant restarts, I could play games on steam for hours with no problems. I did a fresh install of windows- still restarts. Updated and rolled back drivers. I did practically everything. I had assumed it was a GPU problem and was looking into replacements. I checked my PSU turning it off and pulling it out to check wires. My PC was fine for a week weirdly enough, guessed there was tension on the wires. Played a game today and got an error for low memory and it crashed, steam stopped responding. Nothing was working so I hard shut down my PC. It got stuck in a reboot cycle. At this point, I assumed it must be RAM I checked it individually in A1 and A2. All sticks were unstable in A2. I’m going to do a memtest soon to see if that rules anything out. DOCP is disabled. Windows diagnostic memory test found no problems. If anyone has experienced anything similar I would greatly appreciate the help. Thank you.

Problem is...part A of figuring how the cloth will wrinkle is like actually almost nearly as much work as drawing the cloth wrinkles frame by frame.

I ended up expanding it with additional modes and more chaotic card interactions. This is my first time building multiplayer with rooms/lobbies and handling concurrent players. The most interesting challenges so far have been: • Keeping game state in sync across clients • Handling guest joins without authentication • Reconnect logic when someone refreshes mid-game • Managing multiple active lobbies at once I’m not sure how well it’ll scale yet — I suspect I’ll hit concurrency limits before I expect to. If anyone here enjoys stress-testing multiplayer systems or has feedback on UX/game flow, I’d really appreciate it. https://playcentry.com/ submitted by /u/porkypoy [link] [comments]",

The demo is already out and playable. I’ve genuinely had a lot of fun making and playing this game, and I want to add multiplayer as soon as possible (local and/or online) so I can crash into other people 😂 I’m also exploring funding strategies, so I might launch a Patreon or Buy Me a Coffee to help make this a reality.

      "content": "Hi everyone! A few days ago, I decided to create my own joystick for my game using an RP2040 microcontroller and an HW-504 joystick from Aliexpress. The problem is that Unity misinterprets/normalizes the joystick's center, causing vector 2 to become (0.71, 0.71). Also, the axes only go from 0 to 1, not -1 to 1. I tried fixing this in the Arduino IDE code, which uses PicoGamepad by Jake Wilkinson (RealRobots), and in the InputAction window, but nothing worked. I'm using a new input system. How can I fix this? Here's a screenshot from the input debugger. Also, I'm not very advanced with Unity or Arduino, so please bear with me if I make any mistakes. :) https://preview.redd.it/dzseesxew8jg1.png?width=860&format=png&auto=webp&s=0f1a8fe19dc28397ea2ea08c32a71b92a85e75cc submitted by /u/Trash-K [link] [comments]",

      "content": "I recently have been taking my art more seriously and decided to add my design software (Photoshop, Davinci, Blender, Unity, and Visual Studio) into Steam so that I can track my hours spent working in them. ----Steam Hours Tracking---- Steam does not natively support tracked time for \"Non-Steam Games\" but I found a plugin that allows you to add time for them. The link for that is here https://steambrew.app/plugin?id=02bed50d10a8 This was super easy to install and allows you to custom modify the time stat for non-steam games making tracking easy. ----Adding custom art to Steam games/programs---- When adding \"Non-Steam Games\", you can add cover art, background art and custom logos to them so that they are not identical looking and blank. (you can upload custom art for any game even though they already have existing art for those slots) To do this, click \"Games\" from the top bar of the Steam window. -Find your .exe for whichever program you would like to add, in this case -> Unity (I picked Unity Hub exe here, I know, redundant to launch a launcher with a launcher but it looks nice and I can track time spent) ****You can find the exact location for your exe by right clicking your desktop shortcut -> open file location -Then, in your library on the left bar with all your games and programs, select your added program -Click the settings gear -> Properties -> Customization From here, you can upload custom art and the exact dimensions are listed for each different piece (Cover art, Logo, Background, Wide). The wide background art works for both the Background and the Wide options The pieces I have uploaded above were created with Photoshop CS6. The images used for the Background and Cover Art are not mine. I tried to find the original for the SilkSong art but had no luck, this is where I got the image: https://www.reddit.com/r/HollowKnight/comments/1o227xh/it_has_to_be_one_of_the_best_soundtracks_i_ever/ For the Hollow Knight image, this came from Team Cherry's official Press Kit. This was \"Promo 5\" and can be found by clicking \"Press Kit\" at the bottom of this page: https://www.teamcherry.com.au/games Hollow Knight and Silksong were chosen here because Unity was used to create them and I felt these masterpieces earned the right to guard the access and sanctity of the mighty default cube. I maybe over-edited this one but I like how it turned out and thought I'd share. I have made a couple more of these and will post them in their respective subreddits, but you can check back a few hours from this post on my page and get to them from there. Feel free to download and decorate your Steam programs! submitted by /u/sysko960 [link] [comments]",

I know that I study and work more productive in the evenings, so I usually plan my study sessions, or some work around that time. But a lot of tasks early in the morning are still difficult for me. It’s like I need a few hours after getting up to actually turn my brain on and participate into work meetings or classes more efficiently. But unfortunately, I don’t usually get that time, so my issue is that during most mornings I feel like I am only partially productive, and it has a bit of an influence on my grades and my work results. Do you have any tips or tricks that may help concentrate better? I always try to get a right amount of sleep, but it still feels difficult.

      "content": "Hello Vlad-Squad! 👋 This champ has sparked my interest a while ago and despite people saying he isn't in his best state right now, I would like to pick him up more seriously. I used to pick him top a few seasons ago, but I am currently a mid + support main and would like to add him to my roster for midlane. From what I've heard, Vlad works fairly well into assassins in mid? Is this also your experience (I would assume so due to his W, health regen and HP from itemization & passive)? I would be very grateful if you guys could give me a rundown of your favorite setups; runes and at least the 3 first items you build into assassins. I started League 1.5 years ago, am currently Emerald 2 and peaked in Dia 2; if that is relevant in any way. Another matchup I would love to get your input for is Yasuo. How do you feel about him? Yasuo is currently my biggest nightmare (I'm a Hwei main) and I have no idea if Vlad could potentially remove this guy from being my (almost, not always) permaban. Thank you very much in advance! :-) submitted by /u/Lyrahku to r/VladimirMains [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Hi Everyone, Just two days ago, I launched AI traceability & evaluation platform to enable Zero Trust for AI agents governance. As most of you already know that with OpenClaw hype, more people are leveraging it to create customized AI agents for different purposes. However, the crucial part is that ensuring the agents not doing tasks that can pose harm to users or others. That's why I launched Auditi, a platform that captures AI agents thought and actions with the ultimate objective not only to evaluate AI agents behaviour but also impose auto-halt capability when risk is imminent and suggest remediation for improved alignment. However, here is the real story. I tried to launch it two days ago on Github (only 3 stars) https://github.con/deduu/auditi Also on Product Hunt (only 3 upvotes) https://www.producthunt.com/posts/auditi Reddit (0 upvote) And X (1 like) The impressions across platforms are very discouraging. I am sure then it is not the problem of the platform per se but the way I presented it. Has anybody have the same experience and know how to improve your product launch to get more visibility? I'd be grateful if anyone can share their experience and how to do it in a better way. Best, d submitted by /u/Deep_190 [link] [comments]",

Trash Day: The bin lights up in the specific color of the container that needs to go out. Pet Care: A quick glance at the paw lets you know if the dog has been fed.

      "content": "Hi guys. Around a little less than a year ago, i considered that aroace, and i thought it was pretty concrete. Now im super on the fence. Like, sometimes i have romantic interest in people, but other times i question if it was genuine. A lot of the times i just feel apathetic about the whole romance thing, sometimes i feel like i do need to find someone, i dunno. I know that im definitely not straight, its just finding out what the heck i am is a huge struggle. I would like to say that i dont care that much for labels, but like, its so frustrating to not know about my own identity. I feel like finding out my orientation would be such a huge relief, yk? A while back i saw someone who went by “biaro” (bisexual/aromantic) and ive been rolling with it. Even though ive just been going with that, i still feel like its inadequate for describing whatever i am. Idk, what do you guys think about this?

      "content": "hey everyone, if you are headed to the ragin cajuns game against missouri state on 02/15, you probably know parking around russo park can be a bit of a headache. especially for a weekend afternoon game at 1:00 pm when everyone shows up at once and traffic starts backing up near the stadium entrance. honestly the best move is to check out Prked. you can basically rent someones driveway or a private garage right next to russo park. it is way cheaper than the official lots and you get to skip that massive line of cars trying to get into cajun field. plus it is a way shorter walk than trekking across the entire athletic complex which is a huge plus if you want to get to your seat fast. for the standard options most people end up at the cajun field lot. it is usually the go-to for general public parking but it gets packed quickly. the walk from the far end of the cajun field paved lot to the tigue is pretty long so be prepared to walk a bit. if you have a donor pass you can try for lot a right by the stadium entrance but those spots are very limited and fill up way before first pitch. definitely avoid parking on the grass anywhere along reinhardt drive or bert bertrand drive because campus police are pretty strict about that and they will tow you in a heartbeat. if the main cajun field lot looks like a disaster you can try looking over toward the areas near blackham coliseum but that is a significant walk and sometimes they have other events going on there that block off access. traffic on west congress street and bertrand drive gets really backed up about forty five minutes before the 1:00 pm start time so i would suggest getting to the area by 12:00 pm to give yourself enough time to find a spot and get through the gates. when the game ends everyone tries to funnel out onto congress at the same time so if you can park closer to the perimeter exits of the lot you might save yourself twenty minutes of sitting in your car afterward. hope this helps and geaux cajuns. submitted by /u/Local-Tear9723 to r/parkingguides [link] [comments]",
