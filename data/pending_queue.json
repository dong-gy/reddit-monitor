It would also be a great way to farm money too because i believe that dungeons should give a lot of money depending on the difficulty, for example give 20k money, meduim40k, hard 60k and nightmare 80k money i think it would make grinding for money much more easier, they could also add new boss drops within these dungeons that would have good passive when it comes to forging because i'm kinda getting bored with mine this, then get this pickaxe and mine this it would make progressing seem much more fun and what do you guys think about this idea and feel free to leave your opinions about this. submitted by /u/Ok-Perception-4275 to r/TheForgeRoblox [link] [comments]",

The Warriors heard the Bard’s music and built the Fortress. The Devotees noticed the tower somehow made their plants grow and decided to show up, but the warriors mistook them for monsters and pushed them off.

The reviews on Steam are all rave, but a lot them describe what I think are features of the free patch - trade deals, company rework etc. As far as I can tell, the DLC just adds prestige goods and charters for companies (monopoly etc.). Is there much more, any narrative flavour etc not mentioned in the dev diaries? I appreciate that the free patch with the trade rework was very well received, so wonder if some of the love for that gets mistakenly attributed to the DLC by those who bought it on release. So my question is, do people think the DLC content from CoC significantly contributes to the game, enough to justify ~£17/$20 price tag? submitted by /u/Aggressive-Area-213 to r/victoria3 [link] [comments]",

You can put all the magic logic in the ring class itself and feel a little bit like a wizard that's actually crafting magic rings. But it should be fun for players too. Is this a workable solution?

Question: What’s the overall strategy to have the strongest empire while keeping a very small empire (as in: minimal number of star systems under my direct control)? Context / what keeps happening to me: I’ve been playing “grab as much territory as possible” because it feels like the only way I can scale my economy enough to build fleets. I’ll expand hard and stretch myself thin across 100 stars just to hit ~100k fleet power…and then I’ll check my neighbor who only has like 12–20 systems and they’re sitting at 590k fleet power. That gap feels insane. So: - How do you actually play “tall” in Stellaris and still be #1 militarily? - What are the key pillars (planet specialization, tech rush, megastructures, vassals/federations, etc.)? - What should my early/mid/late priorities look like if I’m trying to stay small but punch way above my weight? - Any specific builds/starts/civics that make this click for a newer player?

My character was an experienced redguard bounty hunter. Wanted to leave hammerfell for something new to spend the rest of his life. Planned on retiring. But got arrested and lost everything. He had to start from scratch. Instead of answering the Dragonborn call, he chose to be selfish. He did every bounty he could, killed dozens of bandits, all to purchase a property near the corrupt town of Falkreath. I finished building the manor, I looked out the alchemy tower, and that was it. I did what made sense for the character I created. I may go back to him later but as of now he’s done. I’m not done with Skyrim, but this was one playthrough out of many. Posting this for someone who was in a similar boat to me. You don’t have to even touch any real quest, you could play it as a sandbox, an adventure game, a completionist game, or like me.

Yet they stated that they're disabling this feature? Stitching the two sides back together like in the picture would allow a proper naval front to develop with a midline of island hexes from Godcrofts to Stema Landing and the eventual target of landing on and overrunning the enemy's large island. A big gripe that I'm hearing from naval clans about this announcement is that they're forced to choose between the lane that can invade the enemy's large island or the lane that can only defend their own faction's large island. It just feels like a huge missed opportunity turning what could be a dynamic ocean lane into two linear ones. submitted by /u/Cakey642 to r/foxholegame [link] [comments]",

This is the build as follows: -9950x3d -RTX 5090 FE -Asus Hero X870E Hero (used) -32GB DDR5 GSkill CAS28 (bought used) -Silent Loop 3 420mm -9100 pro -ROG STRIX 1200W Platinum The Q-Led codes on the motherboard shuffle between 35, 36, 39, 40, 67, 69, 68 after I boot into windows. However, I have run cinebench, and played a few games, and no crashes. Temps get up to 80 degrees during cinebench. I have a negative curve optimizer set to -20 on all cores. If I enable a negative per CCD (10 for CCD0 and 20 for CCD1) cinebench test passes, but as soon as I launch a game the PC freezes. Do we suspect a potential hardware issue somewhere? submitted by /u/edu4rd0zs to r/techsupport [link] [comments]",

We'd like to open up the Kitchen and large Living Room so they feel more connected when spending time in those areas. If we used the current combined area marked \"Kitchen, Living Room\" as our primary living space, it wouldn't be large enough to host gatherings, and then we're kind of wasting the large \"Living Room\" space on the left. Our idea is to basically remove the walls on either side of the Dining Room. It will also require moving the oven from the Dining Room wall along the back wall, and then perhaps enlarging the island. I think we'd then plan to keep a dining table where it is, there just wouldn't be wall boundaries on either side. Does this make sense? It still seems like we're not optimizing the space since now we also have the smaller \"Living Room\" area that isn't really used, but maybe this is the best we can do without major renovations like relocating the entire kitchen. I'd also really love to fit an office somewhere, but it's not necessary. Thanks! submitted by /u/dmeixner to r/floorplan [link] [comments]",

We are a tiny team of two otome game lovers working on our very own otoge called Somnium: The Whale’s Dream , and we wanted to share our project and invite anyone who’s curious to join us as we navigate the waves of game development. 😊 We are learning as we go, and we really value community interaction and feedback as we continue creating the game! For this reason, we recently started a Patreon page where we share literally everything and you can join us for free. 🩵 To give you a little taste of our aesthetics and vibe ✨, here is our logo and banner as well as a character teaser we recently published. https://preview.redd.it/ngpmmji9nydg1.jpg?width=2643&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a0b50b5388033328a60146c6a597a0e539ad4fed https://preview.redd.it/nlhp7lz5oydg1.png?width=1736&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c902fe69051be308a00a434dd0d80e509f4135f This character has since then been revealed, so if you are curious to know more and want to keep up with the character or the game’s development please join us on Patreon. Our goal is to build this game with people who love otome games as much as we do, not just quietly behind closed doors. If you have questions, thoughts, or just want to say hi, we’d love to chat in the comments. Thank you for taking a look and for supporting indie devs! 🩵🫶 submitted by /u/tiny_waves_studio to r/IndieOtome [link] [comments]",

I was most intrigued by the Limited Table Space rule and the possibility of endless exploring/infinite play space, both of which I hadn't heard about. Limited Table Space (timestamp 13:00): This says you must have space for at least 4 - 8\" X 8\" (200mm X 200mm) map tiles for your game but you can put out as many above that as you can. This is possible because as you explore you can take map tiles off the table that no Helldivers are on (or if they are on they die) to make room to add others. This mechanic also allows for... Endless Exploring/Infinite Play Space (timestamp 13:58): Since the battlefield isn't limited to a set number or specific tiles you can potentially keep exploring down an endless corridor of map tiles if you wanted to! This is a unique mechanic that I think can make for some interesting situations. And since map tiles are shuffled and recycled it really will randomize the events/POIs/etc you find if you choose to go this route. submitted by /u/MelArlo to r/TableTopHelldivers [link] [comments]",

Whenever I try to join a game using a code, the game simply loads until this screen and never connects. I’ve already: Changed network settings Tested on different internet connections Tried different networks entirely So far, nothing has worked. What makes this more confusing is that it seems to be OS-related : If I host a server on macOS , no one is able to join. If a friend on Windows hosts , everyone (except me) can join almost instantly. Because of this, I strongly suspect the problem is related to macOS ↔ Windows compatibility , or possibly how hosting/networking is handled on macOS specifically. Has anyone else on macOS experienced this? Any known fixes, required ports, or official acknowledgment of this issue? submitted by /u/Vetor_ to r/HytaleInfo [link] [comments]",

      "content": "I don’t hate these movies at all. In fact, I enjoyed them, as did most people. But there’s just something about a superhero origin story that can’t be beaten, especially when it features characters who haven’t had a good origin movie in a while. I like to see the contrast of the hero before and after they get their costumes and powers. It’s emotionally fulfilling to see them go from a powerless but well-meaning nobody, who wishes they could do something to make a difference in the world, eventually go through the trials and tribulations that turns them into that super-powered someone who can finally make a change they want to see. In the 2025 movies, we never see who the baseline “Clark Kent” was without his powers and costume except for some vague flashbacks. In First Steps, we hardly get to know what Reed, Sue, Ben, and Johnny are like before the space incident, other than “they’re a family of famous astronauts.” What makes them tick? How do they view the world and everyone in it? How do they respond to problems if “superpowers and influence” aren’t an option? These types of questions are important if you want the audience to have a strong emotional attachment to these characters. I know, people are getting sick of superhero origin stories, and Superman’s origin and the Fantastic Four’s origin are already well-known to most people. But the “Hero’s Journey” is such a timeless story concept that I’m sure there could’ve been a way to make it feel fresh, or at least nostalgic to moviegoers. submitted by /u/Sectumsempra845 to r/unpopularopinion [link] [comments]",

Well, in our game, you're an engineer pretending to be a robot on a junk planet, and sometimes those \"defective\" robot neighbors fall behind on their scrap payments. That's where Kong comes in. He's our little solution for dealing with... ahem... \"problematic assets.\" Turns out, every spare part counts when you're building your base inside a rusted robot chassis! We tried to make the process of turning rusty debtors into valuable components as satisfying (and pixel-art cute!) as possible. How do you guys handle \"consequences\" in your cozy games without making them too grim? Always curious to see different takes! submitted by /u/mersocial6 [link] [comments]",

During the weekdays I'm working as a software engineer, in the weekends and evenings I try to relax and do fun stuff. Some of my interests: Music Mostly scouting for records in the record shops, listening and enjoying new music and visiting concerts. Genres I like are psychedelic rock, punk, some metal, some rap and anything progressive. The last record I've bought is from Jehtro Tull and the last concert I've been to was Psychedelic Porn Crumpets. Sports Mostly watching sports (football) but I also enjoy the occasional swim and I've been trying to go to the gym more often. Gaming PC is my platform. Been playing alot of Counter-Strike for the last 15 years, but I love most kind of games. Long conversations That's the thing that makes me the most happy I think. Long, maybe deep, conversations on any topic with a good friend, count me in! I won't give everything about my life away, but this is some of it. Anything that interests you or just want to start a conversation? Let's do it! You can be from anywhere, any age, any gender. If you're closeby I'll take you for a lunch and a beer (or non-alcoholic drink if you prefer) sometime soon. submitted by /u/SomeWinters to r/MakeNewFriendsHere [link] [comments]",

Theres not a lot of video tutorials out there (at least to the quality of brackeys) and I was wondering where I should go from here. I still feel very clueless at the moment haha Thanks! submitted by /u/BetterSchwifty [link] [comments]",

It’s a cozy, browser based lite MMO where you can brew potions, grow ingredients, and team up with other players to take down big, ridiculous bosses. No downloads, no grind, no pressure. Just open your browser and play. I’m a dad from Sydney who’s been building games and systems for years, and this one is fully self funded and made in the scraps of time that exist around parenting and life. My 11-year-old daughter is creating the artwork for the game as she learns digital art, and I’m handling the code, design, and everything under the hood. Some visuals are still placeholders while she works through each asset, but every final piece of art you see in the game is hers. I built Little Potion Garden because I love MMOs, but I don’t have the time to live inside one anymore. I wanted something lightweight, social, and genuinely fun to jump into whenever I get a moment. A game that feels welcoming instead of overwhelming. A world that grows over time, not one that demands your entire schedule. If you’re into cozy games, browser MMOs, or just want a place to relax and brew something magical, I think you’ll enjoy what we’re building here. The game updates every week, the art keeps improving as my daughter adds more of her work, and the world is slowly becoming exactly what we imagined.

However, I strongly believe she feels like it is a responsibility of hers. She feels like it is her job to make her dad happy, and she constantly asks for alone time/trips. She follows him around the house like a puppy dog (even into the bathroom) where he has to stare at her like, are you gonna leave? She cannot function without him. She describes her body to him, asks inappropriate questions about his genitals. She’ll even lay on the floor right in front of him and shake her butt. He says he doesn’t establish boundaries bc it’s a free for all at their mamas. Basically, he doesn’t want to be a prude bc their mom is so open. He wants to be the fun parent…to the point that both of his kids have zero responsibility in our home and literally get whatever they ask for. It’s their way or the highway. Anyway, I just feel like the signs are there for both of them. There’s an immense codependency. She just went back to college after a month long break and he’s been anxious and moody since she left. He’s been snappy at me and distant. She calls every hour of the day, when she visits from college she can’t be away from him. She can’t even stay the night at her mom’s house and when her mom invites her to dinner, she invites my partner to go too! And she loves her mom. Has the greatest relationship with her, but cannot be away from dad. Idk what to do or if I’m seeing things incorrectly. submitted by /u/Silly_Assistance_558 to r/Codependency [link] [comments]",

      "content": "I’ve only managed to play halfway through the second game, and I simply lack the patience to continue. The game’s controls are undoubtedly the worst I’ve ever encountered. They’re incredibly delayed and unresponsive at times, which is incredibly frustrating. For instance, when I press the jump and grab button to climb an obstacle, the character doesn’t grab on, so it takes me about a minute to climb onto something. Additionally, during chase scenes, I often have to run and jump over a ledge and onto the other side. However, the character doesn’t jump far enough sometimes, and I end up plummeting to my death. So, I have to re-do the chase scene multiple times until the character finally decides to jump far enough and make it across. The depth perception of the game is also quite confusing. When I walk on narrow pathways, I always end up walking and falling off the side because I can’t tell how close I am to the edge. There are also a few chase scenes where I have to slide into a vent hole to escape, but of course, I slide into the wall, missing the vent hole, and the monster catches me. The co-op mechanic in the second game is also annoying. Your teammate doesn’t help you out when you’re lost and don’t know what to do next. They only assist you when there’s something for them to do, like a jump assist or pushing something heavy. I also noticed that the third game of the series has the same co-op mechanic bs. Apparently, if your teammate dies but you don’t, you still have to restart from the last checkpoint, regardless. So, yeah, screw that. It’s even worse if anything. I’ve played similar games like Playdead’s Inside and Limbo, and they were nothing like this. Those games were actually enjoyable, and I still replay them to this day. Little Nightmares could never compare. submitted by /u/RoundTurtle538 to r/LittleNightmares [link] [comments]",

      "content": "In this world superpowers can take many shapes and forms, sometimes they are overwhelmingly useful, other times they are not. However what is consistent are a few major factors: Superpowers adapt the body so they can be adequately used, whether or not it’s used effectively is a different story. Usually superpowers fit along one side of the spectrum of powers, there are deviations but those are mutations and very rare. Superpowers fit within these classes: Physical, Mental, Psychic, Energy projection, or Special. Special usually means that the power is highly specialized and doesn’t really fit within these others After deciphering what power type so someone has, it then becomes a game of figuring out how strong it is. If say someone had super strength it’d go like this: Strong enough to punch through brick without really hurting anything Strong enough to lift up and even potentially throw a small vehicle Strong enough to act as a load bearing pillar on a large building. Strong enough to essentially output as much damage as a small nuke in one punch! Anything stronger than 4. After which they are judged on utility where 5 means it can be used in just about any situation, and 1 being ”it might be better to just not use it.” And finally the power averages for this verse are: Class 1: 9% Class 2: 21% Class 3: 46% Class 4: 23% Class 5: 1% submitted by /u/soup100 to r/PowerScaling [link] [comments]",

      "content": "As many of you have probably experienced in vanilla-ish Create packs, Diorite tends to be a bottleneck due to its dependence on mechanical crafters (which in of itself is quite time-consuming). This has led me to exploring the possibility of using vanilla minecraft Crafters which can be triggered per redstone tick (2 game ticks). The easiest way to perform complex recipes in a vanilla Crafter is to check for overflow on its inputs, only ticking the Crafter whenever there is a surplus of the ingredients, thus keeping the recipe in the Crafter (hence the comparator on depots). The vanilla method of doing this is quite complex for me (and limited by hoppers transfer speed) and so I sat down and tried to figure out a design that incorporates the aforementioned concept. The input is unified with a single Frogport for easy stocking (just slap a gauge on that bad boy for each of your required ingredient) and add filtered funnels for it on the sides of the Crafter. This lets us handle recipes that consist of 1-2 ingredients (e.g. Diorite, Electron Tubes, Propellers, Brass Hands). First set a recipe inside the Crafter and then provide a surplus of both ingredients. If there are items in both side depots, the sticky piston will activate an observer clock which ticks the Crafter pushing the crafted recipe down the barrel and down a chute for storage (a buffer barrel is required so that the chute won't pull ingredients from the Crafter). This can be done very early in survival, with a minimum requirement of making it to having Brass ingots and electron tubes to make the brass funnels, quartz for the observers and comparators. The Frogport handling is entirely optional. Provided an infinite supply of cobble and quartz this can produce 1 diorite per tick, or 20 diorite per second (72k per hour). submitted by /u/Nm3sis to r/CreateMod [link] [comments]",

      "content": "If there isn't a big update on Monday consider this unplayable game dead, no new content for 8 months besides recycled events, cosmetics that don't help the game at all, and a 30 round bar mag that barely gets used. At least for me and some its the deciding factor if I quit now or later, its honestly inevitable with how slow things move in this game. And there's nothing to expect since gus already got his payday from packs and gamepasses meaning he no longer has a reason to pursue this game and can let it die as he lost the passion for it long ago. Its sad to see a game with an unlimited ceiling of potential be killed off by its own incompetent team. I have suggested it many times but obviously in a server where if the devs aren't in a good mood they won't even consider your suggestion, don't expect them to acknowledge when you talk about their poor choices and abuse of their power.

I like opacity because using this style I don't need to 'pause' the game while the player is doing stuff in menus, this might be handy because it's a management game so, plenty of stuff to do via menus, but there are plenty of simulated RPG elements too, so I don't want to 'keep it going' when you might miss something important or multiple context menus start to queue. submitted by /u/mullerjannie [link] [comments]",

With integer scaling, there are black bars on the top and bottom with every console. When I crop them, the vertical scaling becomes 9.643x.
