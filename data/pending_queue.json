      "content": "Brazil’s minimum wage is around USD 250 to 300 per month, yet most handheld devices cost the equivalent of several months of income for the average person. The biggest issue is import taxes. Brazil has long had import taxation, but in recent years enforcement and overall tax burden have become much harsher. Depending on how customs evaluates the package, total taxes can now reach 90 to 100% of the product’s declared value, something that wasn’t nearly as common in the past. This makes buying anything from abroad stressful. You never know the final price, there’s always fear of extra fees, delays, or customs holds. Since most handhelds aren’t officially sold here, importing is often the only option, and it feels like a gamble every time. What’s especially frustrating is seeing handheld gaming treated as affordable and accessible in other countries, while here it becomes a luxury purchase or a financial risk. It’s not about wanting premium tech, it’s about how basic access to a hobby is restricted by low wages and aggressive taxation. submitted by /u/Original-Educator-38 to r/SBCGaming [link] [comments]",

      "content": "How would chest inventories be separated? Say I have an actor for chests with all the blueprints for adding, removing, and moving items within it. In a level I have 2 chests and I want them both to be that same chest actor. One chest has a sword the other chest has a shield. How would I initialize them with these different inventories? Do I have to make children actors to that first chest actor and then give them specific inventories with an inherited blueprint? My concern is that I would have to make an actor for every chest in the game with this method and perhaps that would be inefficient. Though some chests will have different models and enemies might spawn their corpse as a chest to be looted, so it would be necessary to some degree anyway.

After reading the galery card, I think it teases heavely on Black Cat (show up where least wanted) and Kingpin (who’s in charge of the city put it on lockdown). But the image of the card also teases White Fox. What I think about all of it: The devs know that the game needs more vanguards and strategists, so I would not be surprised if season 7 releases a character for each role (KP - Tank) (BC - DPS) (WF - Sup). Another theory: Miller Ross posted about a season having 2 strategists around season 5. He could be talking about season 7 with Black Cat and White Fox both being strategists. Also, they would break the pattern of having a male and female character per season, but I think that would be balanced out cause season 8 should be 2026 Hellfire Gala and it should introduce Cyclops and Colossus to the game. This post is just for fun. Just a few theories Ive got about the next few months of the game and would like to hear what yall think. submitted by /u/manofsteel130 to r/marvelrivals [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Hey everyone 👋 I’ve been solo-developing a Roblox game for the past few months and I finally pushed it into open beta . It’s a ghost-themed fishing + battle game with progression, upgrades, and PvE battles. Everything you see — systems, UI, balance — was built by me, and I’m still actively improving it. I’m not trying to sell anything — I’d genuinely love: honest feedback bug reports balance suggestions ideas on what feels fun vs boring If you’re into Roblox games or game dev in general, I’d really appreciate you checking it out and giving it a thumbs up if you enjoy it. Game link: Ghost Catch on Roblox! Thanks for helping a solo dev out — seriously means a lot 🙏 submitted by /u/GladHotel737 to r/robloxgamedev [link] [comments]",

The idea is to used my lived experience as a disabled artist to make a cozy fashion/shop sim. The player character is on medical leave from college and goes back to their home town after developing a chronic illness, and the people in their town come together to help them open up their own shop filled with handmade apparel. There's more game mechanic wise but I don't want this post to be too long. Anyway, while I've only ever coded HTML/CSS, I've always loved pixel art, even though I struggled with it. After making this, I really want to learn more about game deving so I can bring this little dream of mine into reality. I've watched a few lengthy YT videos on Godot, but I could use some help finding more in depth, accessible resources! submitted by /u/exopsyche [link] [comments]",

This game started off ok with a messy first fight and we had a weird comp but we pulled out in the end. Their tank went dva and it all went downhill as they 5 man dived our backline and was eating anything of value. I couldn’t keep our backline alive for the life of me as wuyang and echo kept getting rolled and their reaper was on the back 24/7 as well. I felt the next few fights until our tank swapped was just our backline getting rolled(or I just didn’t turn around) and me fading to the tank and praying we can pull off a 2v4,though ngl our tank was doing great and our dps were counterswapping their lives out so I don’t think the could’ve done more wuyang also swapped to a more survivable hero eventually as well so we were doing better. But then I feel like our tank swapping to dva literally started just dive bombing whoever they saw first which kind of worked kind of didn’t but it got us to the last point where I think our first mistake was not kiting kiri ult when we all litirally could’ve jus left. Then when we flipped point we were down two and the looked like they were going to recounted so our kiri ults point which I don’t think I can blame them as I couldn’t see how many people were on high but our dva litirally flies into their team making tons of space and pushing them back but also using ult in the process so we more or less wasted two ults and staggered out a solid 20%. Last fight reaper tps in I ult reaper to keep them alive probably should’ve faded(I can’t remember if I had it) but souj killed me mid ult and it was just over. I’m not sure where I could’ve done better as I switched to healing orbs when dva started eating all my orbs I was doing decent healing as I was 7k above everyone else at the end of the match they all had 12-13k my dmg was lacking a bit me and other support both had 1k less than theirs but I feel like with reaper giving constant backshots and souj clicking heads dmg and dva eating everything dmg value was hard to come by. I also never really ran out of heals so I was never desperate to dps. I thought about swapping to brig or Lucio to go all in like they did/counterswap dva but I feel like brigs so bad into a good reaper and I doubt we could’ve survived 5 man dive anyways. and I rarely play Lucio on my alt I mess around with him and I’m diamond 2(haven’t peaked yet) but I feel like I’m just trolling on him and winning. I’d like any advice on what to do and look for, have I peaked as a player who can only play casually and doesn’t bother ult tracking? Should I have swapped I’m not an otp by any means I just feel like survival was what was needed of me that game(I can brig, troll on Lucio, Ana, Juno, kiri, illari, and bap). Should I be more aware of my backline(I did get mildly flamed by echo for not looking at him but he swapped and I feel like we did a lot better I also don’t think an echo should expect that much from a lowly moira who only has limited piss range). Should I be looking to do more damage as some content creators preach?(I don’t believe in letting my team die unless I also trade but then we’re literally even so there was no point really unless we trade tank imo). Should I just quit work and grind ow? submitted by /u/Clean_Pound3389 to r/OverwatchUniversity [link] [comments]",

Obviously as arcade games the ultimate goal is a 1cc, but most home ports of arcade games in the 32 bit era gave players a limited amount of continues they could utilize to finish games. I tend to use these as a sort of easy difficulty because a 1cc is a bit too hardcore for me, but I'm also not into credit feeding an unlimited amount. submitted by /u/sonicdv to r/metalslug [link] [comments]",

During development, I shared a few posts on this sub and got some decent engagement, feedback, comments, and discussions which honestly got me excited. When the demo was ready, I expected at least a handful of people to try it out, even just out of curiosity. To lower the barrier, I released it on itch.io so it could be played directly in the browser instead of requiring a download. I thought that would make things easier for players. I made a post announcing the demo launch… and it got little to no engagement. That was a bit of a reality check. Getting attention and feedback during development felt much easier than convincing people to actually click and play, even when the demo is free and accessible. I’m curious has anyone else experienced this gap between dev interest and player interest? What helped you convert “looks cool” into actual plays? submitted by /u/dev_dev_dev_ [link] [comments]",

Now, with the cliffhanger at the end, I have no idea if the devs are going for a sequel or dlcs but still here's a few to suggestion to make the amazing into nearly perfect: -A weapon artes or ashes of war like mechanics. It seems to me like the skeleton for it is already there with each weapon category having a special ability, I think it would be interesting to have something a bit more unique for a few weapons. - A way to farm entropic essence even if it's a slow grind. I had already done most of the game, upgraded my lantern as much as I could and also my spells, and then I stumble on Huy, no way to finish his quest unless I keep him in mind for a new game plus. It would also enable a player to grind for it if they want to max out their spells. -More weapon types with unique move sets would also go a long way in my opinion.

Here is how it works: You can earn credits by testing indie games/apps (fun + you help other makers) You can use credits to get your own game tested by real people No fake accounts -> all testers are real users Test more games -> earn more credits -> your game will rank higher -> you get more visibility and more testers/users It's called IndieAppCircle and you can check it out here: https://www.indieappcircle.com/games For uploading your game, you really only need a link to it. You can add a description of the game and a logo so that people know what to expect. You should also add instructions on what people should test (can be very general as well). There are also other categories like web apps, android/iOS apps/games or chrome extensions allowed on the platform so there should be enough interesting stuff to test and earn credits!

Here is how it works: You can earn credits by testing indie games/apps (fun + you help other makers) You can use credits to get your own game tested by real people No fake accounts -> all testers are real users Test more games -> earn more credits -> your game will rank higher -> you get more visibility and more testers/users It's called IndieAppCircle and you can check it out here: https://www.indieappcircle.com/games For uploading your game, you really only need a link to it. You can add a description of the game and a logo so that people know what to expect. You should also add instructions on what people should test (can be very general as well). There are also other categories like web apps, android/iOS apps/games or chrome extensions allowed on the platform so there should be enough interesting stuff to test and earn credits!

Also everything is connected to real life of course, Man City is good in game because they're good IRL but I'm talking mostly about things that don't affect gameplay (Greenwood is just code in-game and a decent player in the engine). I'll start with one (or two) examples that are a bit less obvious. Many people start lower league saves with non-historic clubs, maybe it's their local club, maybe they have the best badge, maybe they're the worst in the league etc. I however can't bring myself to manage one of the least-supported clubs in the league, even if I start in the lower leagues, I'm definitely picking the fallen giant with a big fan base for the level. This has gameplay implications of course with higher attendances and revenue but that's not my reason for doing it at all. I want to feel like I'm making lots of people happy and that I can feel part of the team by searching about them and finding some resources. I also can't pick a \"plastic\" club such as MK Dons, even ones with fans, because they've been turned into an RB club for example. TL;DR: What are some less-obvious things you do because of real life, and not because of gameplay implications. submitted by /u/Mackarosh to r/footballmanagergames [link] [comments]",

      "content": "The latest roblox release has ruined almost all creator games for MacOS players. This is because of a key feature in all these games known as \"multi select\" losing its ability to work. With the new release of roblox switching the input for Ctrl from the \"command\" key to the \"control\" key on MacOS devices, all systems that used to require the input of the command key, including multi-selecting objects in creator games no longer work. To reproduce this simply go into a game like \"Tower Creator\" or \"Obby Creator\" on a mac device and try selecting multiple objects while holding down the command/control key. What I found most peculiar is how roblox studio still uses command+c and command+click for cloning and multi-select respectively yet actual roblox games had their MacOS keybinds changed causing issues. Would really appreciate if this got decent traction cause it's causing me and a lot of other mac users alot of trouble trying to build things and if anyone reading this has dev forum posting access I would heavily appreciate awareness being brought to this issue. submitted by /u/Negative-Courage2889 to r/robloxgamedev [link] [comments]",

I have a friend that is really good at these type of games, much better than me, definitely. Even at my own game, and he is playtesting every version. But not an expert in these games. He is passionate about doing things as optimally as possible. So he set some times that would be very, very hard for me to beat or come close to. I've set HIS time as the DevTime. Is that morally ok?

A hive mind plant that's controlled by the souls of a dragonet and human that died long ago is quite out there, probably the weirdest thing I've read about. ). Turns out dragon stories can have that sort of things, though my opinion on them differs. I don't find the fact dragons arrive in meteors in the Dragonheart movie series to be that strange, perhaps because I was already found of the idea and planned to implement it in my stories. But I totally see why anyone would find that reveal weird. I also don't find the reveal \"X fantasy setting is earth in the future\" that strange either, but that has to do with the fact I imagine the author wanted to add in some grand twist. Basically I stop thinking about the in universe aspect and begin thinking about the meta/writing reasoning part, which is a personal thing. I guess the Legend of Spyro has its own weird stuff, but for the purple derg it is totally inspired from avatar, and for the rest I consider strange in it... Well, the whole golem thing, the Destroyer and making a new world (literally) is appealing enough, but i see it more as way for the devs to stupidly up the stakes.

Not really anything positive can be taken from yesterday. Having had some time to think it over I still think he’ll he given the next two seasons to prove he’s the long term answer at QB for us. I’ve no doubt there’s the talent there but the decision making and mentality for me are under serious questioning. I know we’ve changed OC and we were down a few keys guys last night but to play that poorly is simply unacceptable. In terms of the future I struggle to see us doing anything other than keep Stroud on. No chance we trade for a big time QB simply due to the cap cost of someone like Burrow, Herbert etc (putting to one side how unlikely it would be to get them). In terms of moving Stroud on maybe a team like the Jets, Browns etc maybe give us a first for him but I find it unlikely I guess my confusion is how we went from him balling out rookie year to this season where he’s been poor quite often (yes had some great moments) but the last two games he’s looked like a deer in the headlights Got to hope he puts a power of work in during the offseason and between Caley and Ryans can get the message through to him that it’s now or never for his future at the Texans submitted by /u/Relevant-Goose5483 to r/Texans [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Just a PSA. We have a lot of questions in this sub from people looking to get started. They want advice on what to do, where to go, what engine to pick, what game to make, etc etc. One of the things that helps set game developers up for success, IMHO, is the ability to do your own research and help yourself. If you've done some research into your question, come here and tell us what research you have already done and what you have found. That makes it easier for us to help you. If you ask for help having done nothing yourself, it's difficult for people to help you. Or rather, why should they? A wealth of material exists to help answer those basic questions - consult those first before asking for help. If you want to succeed as a game developer, you need to master the skill of researching things yourself and finding solutions to new problems. You'll never build a game if you just post on reddit any time you get stuck. During the development of your game, you will encounter problems that no one else has ever seen, and its your job to solve them. You can ask for help and advice, sure, but if you don't learn to help yourself at least part of the time, you won't make it. I don't mean to sound harsh. But its the truth. Learn to help yourself. Develop those research skills - they are a lot more important than you think, and they apply to more than just games. submitted by /u/AngelOfLastResort [link] [comments]",

On the other hand, the Godot editor’s integration is too good to give up for a separate windowed setup. I’ve been looking at how vscode-neovim embeds a real Nvim instance as a backend. Has anyone explored a similar GDExtension for Godot? I’d love to know if there are major architectural blockers that have stopped this from becoming a standard plugin.

My storage system was locked in this week that allows for thousands-millions of books on shelves and inventoried and searchable by any metric that people want, (Name, author, genre, shelf, ect.) The base ordering/inventory/auction UI system is locked in. My ledger connects to my inventory manager and allows the player to place bids, order wholesale and view stocked inventory. I got a lot of work done on the NPC systems including spawning, taking books from shelves, queuing, placing books on counter and exiting shop. I even installed a rudimentary pathing system so they don't get stuck as easily on objects, and I also added a feature that lets the player push the NPCs around, so even if they get stuck you can push them around. So yeah, pretty fun week. submitted by /u/Lucky-Space6065 [link] [comments]",

It was funny at first but now it irks me. I think it’s downright unattractive and really puts me off him when he gets like it. He’s always tired, never wants to do anything, I gave up a lot for him to be with him, which isn’t a problem necessarily, but when I look at what I got for my efforts it really makes me a bit resentful. I keep telling him to go to the doctor in case there’s an underlying issue, he won’t. He’s lazy about his health. He’s always going on about how little sleep he got the night before, but I know that’s BS because I’ve been awake several times for long periods during the night and know he was sleeping soundly at the time he says he was awake. He’s been tested for sleep apnea so it’s not that. It seems to be this bragging game - who has it the hardest? I’m sick of it. It’s getting to the stage where I’m just not feeling physically attracted anymore. Anyway, rant over, thanks for reading. submitted by /u/ShadowSelf80 to r/Marriage [link] [comments]",

(If you don't care then this will waste your time) For me, it honestly ruined the game for me. I halted any further hunting and deemed all the shinies I had as worthless. I know that sounds dumb as hell. At the time, I actually never really thought about how the balls would carry over at all. Of course it does make sense why they went with the strange ball route, but I still wish it would've just been regular balls instead. It's such a shame because I think PLA is imo one of the best Pokemom games ever made, it terms of atmosphere. I loved just being in it while doing monotonous tasks like hunting or gathering materials. Jubilife Village's theme has got to be one of the best game tracks I've ever heard. I get warm goosebumps anytime I hear it in Youtube videos i watch. I'm coping for a way to eventually swap pokeballs (albeit very restrictive of course) in a future game. I would immediately go back to PLA and pick right back up where I was in a heartbeat. Anyway, how did you guys feel? Did your soul leave your body like mine did?

      "content": "The majority of game developers reccomend that you splash a substantial amount of cash on getting a professional steam capsule made for your indie game, but spending something like $500-700 on capsule art seems insane to me. Is it really that worth it? My game's wishlist count is very low at the moment (50, increasing by ~1 a day), so that kind of money could be unwise since it might mean my game doesn't make any ROI. At the same time though, I am hoping that releasing a demo would give my game a lot more coverage by streamers and having good capsule art for that is incredibly important. So it feels like a chicken-and-egg situation where I don't know for sure wether my game will be successful enough to make a commission worth it, but at the same time my game could get a lot more coverage if I had one. It's a bit of a gamble is what I'm saying. Don't get me wrong, that isn't the only thing about my steam page which might be reducing wishlists (all of which I am working on), but the capsule art definitely seems to be the biggest white elephant. Peoples reactions to the game on social media have been small but very positive recently which gives me confidence but I don't know if that equates the same as being successful enough to earn more than the $800 I will have to spend to make it. Is it worth it? I would love to know what you think, especially people who have done the same. My steam store page purely for reference. submitted by /u/spicedruid [link] [comments]",

Both would contrast with similar egg throwing physics and suction for egg production. Yoshi uses his tongue to pull in enemies and Birdo could use her mouth for suction at close range. Initially It seem to have work mostly in favor for Baby Mario due to the wider arsenal of mechanics. You could go more in depth and level locked stages per partner, Birdo having slightly different mechanics than Yoshi. For transformations, a balloon, vacuum cleaner, dump truck and wrecking ball seem to make the most sense for Birdo. submitted by /u/DajuanKev to r/Mario [link] [comments]",

But since then it continued to decrease. Was thinking that maybe the algorithm looked at the decline for the day that Steam was down and interpreted it as a decrease in visits and lowered its future visibility. Or maybe this is normal, since sales were very low also. I'm basically posting to see if others have the same pattern as shown here. Is this normal? or is visibility typically higher after getting the 10 reviews required for Steam to give it a review score. here a link if you need to see the context steam page submitted by /u/cuttinged [link] [comments]",

If we win the awards, they will ask for a group picture, videos and a speech etc, how do i keep being faceless in this situation? Thank you for reading submitted by /u/yetiic [link] [comments]",

Not even speaking from a \"Blazer fans are already a shafted minority and deserve their happy ending\" perspective like he's saying here, but I feel like Mandy, while being disappointed in Robert's decision to kill Shroud (as she is in the final game), would also completely understand Robert's feelings and what led him to make that decision - even more so if you chose the option where Robert acknowledges that it wasn't a morally \"right\" thing to do. She even laughs at his \"It was kinda like masturbating\" comparison. Mandy had already threatened to kill people at the bar when rescuing Robert from Shroud (obviously not the same thing as murdering someone you've already beaten, but still). I feel like she'd also understand how personal it was to Robert considering what Shroud did to his father. I don't think she'd be the kind of person to distance herself from him over that decision. submitted by /u/FallingBullfrog to r/DispatchAdHoc [link] [comments]",

We have one actually good player and everyone else is decent. I have the least amount of minutes on the team and I’m the tallest player. I posted stats from the season and I have the least amount of minutes (#20). #2 is the player who plays ahead of me. I play at the 5 position and in practice we just run plays like robots where i’m standing at the block. I never get the chance to show the coaches I can actually play but I’ve ran with my team with no coaches and freedom and I look like the best player out there, even ahead of our one good player. I’m stuck in an endless cycle of not being able to prove my worth to the coaches. I get in for the last 5 minutes of the game when we’re already down 30 points and i’m cold off the bench and I can’t show them in practice because i’m pinned to the post. I’m scared talking to him will just make him play me even less because he has told people i’m the worst player on the team. What should I do? If I talk to him what should I ask him? Sorry, this was a bit of a rant, I’m just fed up with losing games and feeling like I could help but am never given the chance. submitted by /u/alex91200 to r/BasketballTips [link] [comments]",

      "title": "OPUS MAGNUM – Völlige Gesundheit (VIP-Paket) Erfahrungen – Dein Weg zu nachhaltigem Wohlbefinden?",
      "content": "Eins direkt vorweg: Das Thema Gesundheit ist für mich schon immer eine Herzensangelegenheit gewesen. Aber Hand aufs Herz, im Dschungel der unzähligen Gesundheits-Tipps, Diäten und Wundermittel verliert man schnell den Überblick. Was mich neugierig auf das OPUS MAGNUM – Völlige Gesundheit (VIP-Paket) gemacht hat, war die Aussicht auf einen ganzheitlichen Ansatz. Nicht nur Symptome bekämpfen, sondern die Wurzeln meiner Gesundheitsprobleme verstehen und angehen. Ich wollte wissen, ob dieses Programm wirklich das Potenzial hat, mein Wohlbefinden auf ein neues Level zu heben. Also habe ich mich entschieden, es für dich (und natürlich auch für mich selbst!) genauer unter die Lupe zu nehmen. JETZT MEHR ERFAHREN → Was ist OPUS MAGNUM – Völlige Gesundheit (VIP-Paket)? Das OPUS MAGNUM – Völlige Gesundheit (VIP-Paket) ist weit mehr als nur ein weiterer Online-Kurs. Es ist ein umfassendes Programm, das darauf abzielt, deine Gesundheit von Grund auf zu transformieren. Das Konzept dahinter ist die \"Völlige Gesundheit\", ein Zustand, in dem Körper, Geist und Seele im Einklang sind. Es geht nicht nur darum, Krankheiten zu vermeiden, sondern aktiv ein Leben voller Energie, Vitalität und mentaler Klarheit zu führen. Hinter diesem Programm stecken Experten, die ihr Wissen und ihre Erfahrungen gebündelt haben, um einen Weg zu mehr Wohlbefinden aufzuzeigen, der wissenschaftlich fundiert und gleichzeitig praxisnah ist. Es ist eine Art Masterplan für deine Gesundheit, der dich Schritt für Schritt an die Hand nimmt. Warum OPUS MAGNUM – Völlige Gesundheit (VIP-Paket) anders ist / Was macht OPUS MAGNUM – Völlige Gesundheit (VIP-Paket) besonders? Was mich persönlich am OPUS MAGNUM – Völlige Gesundheit (VIP-Paket) besonders angesprochen hat, ist der ganzheitliche Ansatz und die Tiefe, mit der die Themen behandelt werden. Es ist keine schnelle Pille, sondern ein Weg, der auf Nachhaltigkeit setzt. **Ganzheitlicher Ansatz:** Im Gegensatz zu vielen anderen Programmen, die oft nur einen Aspekt der Gesundheit beleuchten (z.B. Ernährung oder Fitness), betrachtet OPUS MAGNUM den Menschen als Ganzes. Es geht um körperliche, geistige und seelische Gesundheit im Zusammenspiel. **Wissenschaftlich fundiertes Wissen:** Die Inhalte basieren auf aktuellen wissenschaftlichen Erkenntnissen und werden verständlich aufbereitet. Das gibt mir als Nutzerin das Vertrauen, dass ich hier keine fragwürdigen Ratschläge bekomme. **Praxisnahe Umsetzung:** Es gibt nicht nur Theorie, sondern auch konkrete Anleitungen und Übungen, die man sofort in den Alltag integrieren kann. Das macht es leicht, ins Handeln zu kommen. **Umfangreiches VIP-Paket:** Das VIP-Paket bietet zusätzlichen Support, tiefere Einblicke und exklusive Inhalte, die über das Standardprogramm hinausgehen. Das Gefühl, besonders betreut zu werden, empfand ich als sehr wertvoll. Was bekommst du konkret? Das VIP-Paket ist wirklich prall gefüllt und lässt kaum Wünsche offen. Hier ein Überblick, was du alles erwarten kannst: **Umfassende Videolektionen:** Hochwertig produzierte Videos, die komplexe Themen einfach und anschaulich erklären. Ich habe gemerkt, wie viel Mühe hier in die Didaktik gesteckt wurde. **Interaktive Arbeitsbücher und Leitfäden:** Begleitmaterial, das dir hilft, das Gelernte zu vertiefen und direkt anzuwenden. Ich fand es super, dass ich mir Notizen machen und meine Fortschritte verfolgen konnte. **Exklusive VIP-Boni:** Dazu gehören oft zusätzliche Masterclasses, Live-Q&A-Sessions mit Experten oder Zugang zu einer exklusiven Community. Diese direkten Austauschmöglichkeiten waren für mich ein echtes Highlight. **Meditations- und Entspannungsübungen:** Spezielle Anleitungen, um den Geist zu beruhigen und Stress abzubauen. Ich habe einige davon fest in meine Abendroutine integriert. **Ernährungspläne und Rezeptsammlungen:** Konkrete Vorschläge für eine gesunde und genussvolle Ernährung, die leicht umzusetzen sind. **Bewegungsroutinen:** Anleitungen für einfache, aber effektive Übungen, die du zu Hause durchführen kannst, um deine körperliche Fitness zu verbessern. **Regelmäßige Updates und Erweiterungen:** Das Programm wird kontinuierlich weiterentwickelt und um neue Inhalte ergänzt, sodass du immer auf dem neuesten Stand bleibst. https://preview.redd.it/m2hlcjlgodeg1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e8ef90ac69d529f15b1dd252782721b9a50ce67 JETZT MEHR ERFAHREN → Mein Test: So habe ich OPUS MAGNUM – Völlige Gesundheit (VIP-Paket) erlebt Als ich mit dem OPUS MAGNUM – Völlige Gesundheit (VIP-Paket) gestartet bin, war ich gespannt, ob es meinen Erwartungen gerecht werden würde. Und ich muss sagen: Es hat wirklich überzeugt! Mein erster Eindruck war die hohe Qualität der Videolektionen. Die Inhalte sind nicht nur fundiert, sondern auch sehr motivierend aufbereitet. Ich habe mich nie gelangweilt gefühlt, sondern immer das Gefühl gehabt, etwas Neues und Wertvolles zu lernen. Was mich besonders überrascht hat, war die Tiefe, mit der auf die mentalen Aspekte der Gesundheit eingegangen wird. Ich hatte erwartet, viel über Ernährung und Bewegung zu lernen (was ich auch getan habe!), aber die Lektionen zu Stressmanagement, Achtsamkeit und positiver Psychologie waren für mich ein echter Game Changer. Ich habe gelernt, besser mit Druck umzugehen und meine Gedanken bewusster zu steuern. Die Meditationsübungen waren anfangs eine kleine Herausforderung für mich, aber mit der Zeit konnte ich eine deutliche Verbesserung meiner Konzentration und inneren Ruhe feststellen. Ich habe über einen Zeitraum von mehreren Wochen die Empfehlungen zur Ernährung umgesetzt und bin begeistert, wie einfach es war, kleine Veränderungen mit großer Wirkung zu erzielen. Ich fühle mich energiegeladener und meine Verdauung hat sich spürbar verbessert. Auch die Integration der Bewegungseinheiten in meinen Alltag fiel mir leichter, als ich dachte. Es geht nicht darum, sich zu quälen, sondern darum, den Körper auf eine Weise zu stärken, die Freude macht. Der Austausch in der VIP-Community war ebenfalls ein großer Pluspunkt. Es ist motivierend, sich mit Gleichgesinnten auszutauschen, Fragen zu stellen und Unterstützung zu finden. Das Gefühl, nicht allein auf diesem Weg zu sein, hat mir zusätzlich Auftrieb gegeben. Für wen lohnt sich OPUS MAGNUM – Völlige Gesundheit (VIP-Paket)? Das OPUS MAGNUM – Völlige Gesundheit (VIP-Paket) ist meiner Meinung nach für eine breite Zielgruppe geeignet, die ihre Gesundheit wirklich ernst nimmt und bereit ist, aktiv daran zu arbeiten. **Menschen, die nach einem ganzheitlichen Gesundheitskonzept suchen:** Wenn du genug davon hast, dich nur auf einzelne Symptome zu konzentrieren und stattdessen die Ursachen deiner Beschwerden angehen möchtest. **Personen, die ihre Energie und Vitalität steigern wollen:** Wenn du dich oft müde, ausgelaugt oder energielos fühlst und nach Wegen suchst, deine Lebenskraft zu reaktivieren. **Jeder, der Stress reduzieren und mentale Klarheit gewinnen möchte:** Wenn du unter Stress leidest, dich schwer konzentrieren kannst oder einfach mehr innere Ruhe suchst. **Gesundheitsbewusste, die ihr Wissen vertiefen möchten:** Wenn du bereits an deiner Gesundheit arbeitest, aber noch fundiertere Informationen und konkrete Strategien suchst. **Einsteiger, die einen klaren Fahrplan brauchen:** Wenn du noch am Anfang deines Gesundheitsweges stehst und eine strukturierte Anleitung benötigst. Kritische Punkte / Worauf du achten musst Obwohl ich vom OPUS MAGNUM – Völlige Gesundheit (VIP-Paket) sehr überzeugt bin, gibt es ein paar Punkte, die du beachten solltest, um realistische Erwartungen zu haben: **Keine schnelle Lösung:** Das Programm verspricht keine Wunder über Nacht. Es erfordert Zeit, Engagement und die Bereitschaft, Gewohnheiten zu ändern. Wer eine Sofortlösung sucht, wird hier vielleicht enttäuscht sein. **Eigenverantwortung ist gefragt:** Die Inhalte sind hervorragend, aber du musst sie auch aktiv umsetzen. Niemand kann die Arbeit für dich erledigen. Deine eigene Motivation ist entscheidend für den Erfolg. **Preisliche Investition:** Das VIP-Paket ist eine Investition. Auch wenn der Mehrwert meiner Meinung nach den Preis rechtfertigt, solltest du dir bewusst sein, dass es kein Low-Budget-Produkt ist. Überlege, ob du bereit bist, diesen Betrag für deine Gesundheit zu investieren. **Informationsflut am Anfang:** Gerade zu Beginn kann die Menge an Informationen überwältigend wirken. Nimm dir die Zeit, alles in deinem Tempo durchzugehen und dich nicht unter Druck zu setzen. Mein Fazit zu OPUS MAGNUM – Völlige Gesundheit (VIP-Paket) Mein persönliches Fazit zum OPUS MAGNUM – Völlige Gesundheit (VIP-Paket) fällt durchweg positiv aus. Ich habe in den letzten Wochen so viel über meinen Körper, meinen Geist und die Zusammenhänge gelernt, wie selten zuvor. Das Programm ist extrem gut strukturiert, die Inhalte sind fundiert und die Umsetzung in den Alltag ist dank der praktischen Anleitungen wirklich machbar. Ich fühle mich nicht nur körperlich fitter und energiegeladener, sondern auch mental ausgeglichener. Es ist eine Investition in deine Gesundheit, die sich meiner Meinung nach langfristig auszahlt. Wenn du bereit bist, aktiv an deiner \"Völligen Gesundheit\" zu arbeiten und einen ganzheitlichen Weg suchst, dann kann ich dir das OPUS MAGNUM – Völlige Gesundheit (VIP-Paket) wärmstens empfehlen. Es ist ein wertvoller Begleiter auf dem Weg zu einem vitaleren und glücklicheren Leben. JETZT MEHR ERFAHREN → submitted by /u/Glittering-Sundae228 to r/DigiVertrau [link] [comments]",

On the other hand I am a bit burned out from the constant rake-stepping decisions from Microsoft and Steam has such good will with its consumers. I’m also unsure of how future proof the Steam machine will be based on reports of its weaker than expected specs.

Haven’t seen posts about this, so posting to check: if others have this issue and hopefully get dev attention. Anyone else? submitted by /u/Remarkable-Vast-3687 to r/Openfront [link] [comments]",

      "content": "After a while of searching and testing out games, I finally convinced my New World buddies to dive into ESO. One is hell bent on doing everything (as much as possible) together as a group. The other is chill and open to whatever. I’ve seen the basic tips like making sure you keep up with the stuff that needs time to upgrade like mounts and research, but are there any good tips out there for group play? I know MSQ and alliance and some misc stuff is solo only, but how wonky is coop as far as keeping everyone on track together? Group guy spends most of his solo time doing non-combat related gathering (for example, fishing and mining in new world was his thing), is that viable to do here with minimal combat required/not messing up any group related questing (I.e., if he goes to gather in a random cave that deals with a random quest, will the quest trigger just because he’s there or does it have to be activated outside beforehand?). As far as class and playstyle, one wants to dual wield DK dps and the other wants some kind of nightblade dps. Is it realistic for me to both tank and heal? I’m thinking warden maybe? Or Templar? Any tips for those who have multiple friends that only want to dps? We are excited to get started. Any vets with some fun early tips and tricks for new groups getting ready to play?

Whenever we're watching TV and there's a tank on screen he'll go \"oh that's an M63 Sea Lion Mk. II, it's a German tank\" or something like that. You can probably tell that I'm not so knowledgeable on the topic lol. Anyway, I want to make a drinking game where everyone at the party has a piece of paper with a picture of a tank on it, and at some point in the night they show it to my friend. If he can guess the tank the person with the paper drinks, if he can't guess it then he drinks. The only problem is I don't know anything about tanks! So I'm hoping to get some help coming up with a list of about 15 tanks with names and pictures for my friend to guess. Ideally he'd get about 3/4 of them right (it is a party for him after all) with a range of difficulty. He did used to play a lot of war thunder and watch YouTubers who do war game content if that helps get an idea of how hard to make it. What tanks should I pick? submitted by /u/awakenedsma to r/tanks [link] [comments]",

Are you tracking your todos somewhere separate or just letting claude do the tracking? In this particular case I have seen todo items get crossed off Claude's list without fully implementing them. This could be related to context rot --- i have not had todo item issues since compacting at 50%. Also, I noticed there is browser control built in to claude so does that mean it's better to use that than the trusty playwright mcp?

      "content": "Hey, dumb question. I had created a dictionary that keeps track of all the items the player picked up, with stats being held within arrays in the dictionary. They hold the item name, damage it does and an icon associated with the item. I am trying to display this icon within a UI element. However, when I try to access the texture, I can get the array but not the items in it. Here's my code: panel / itemPanel.gd (UI node i want to hold the image in): extends Panel var item: TextureRect = $aspRect/color/item var player: CharacterBody3D = $\"../player\" const FL_STUDIO = preload(\"uid://cky184lm61gh3\") @export var itemSlot: int # Called every frame. 'delta' is the elapsed time since the previous frame. func _process(delta: float) -> void: if player: item.texture = FL_STUDIO print(player.heldItems.values().get(itemSlot)) body / body.gd (AreaBody2D, child of a parent node, iconName and iconTxtr are vars within a script in the parent node): extends Area3D var parent: Node3D = $\"..\" @onready var mesh: MeshInstance3D = $\"../mesh\" func _on_body_entered(body: Node3D) -> void: if body.heldItems.size() < body.maxItems: var items = body.heldItems var itemStats: Array = [parent.itemName, parent.changeHealth, parent.iconTxtr] items[items.size()] = itemStats parent.queue_free() else: print(\"inventory full!\") Right now this accesses the array I need within the dictionary, but I can't actually get the values out of the arrays. I had attempted to look up the answer but had found no solution. Whenever I try to access the values in the array, I get error message \"Invalid access to property or key 'itemSlot' on a base object of type 'Dictionary[int, Array]'.\" It appears the error is on line 14 of itemPanel.gd.

      "content": "i am using a RayCast3D to break blocks in a GridMap. Sometimes the block is removed correctly, but other times nothing happens, even though the RayCast is clearly hitting the object. is_colliding() returns true, the collider is detected as a GridMap, and destroy_block() is called, but the result is inconsistent: Sometimes the block is deleted Sometimes no block is deleted at all It seems the issue is related to how the collision point is converted into GridMap cell coordinates, or because the hit point is on the edge of a cell, causing it to resolve to an empty or wrong cell. Because of this, the block-breaking behavior is unreliable and only works “sometimes” instead of always. # Player script if Input.is_action_just_pressed(\"attack\"): if ray\\_cast\\_3d.is\\_colliding(): var hit = ray\\_cast\\_3d.get\\_collider() print(hit.name) if hit.has\\_method(\"destroy\\_block\"): hit.destroy\\_block( ray_cast_3d.get_collision_point() - ray_cast_3d.get_collision_normal() ) # GridMap script extends GridMap func destroy_block(world_coordinate): var map\\_coordinate = local\\_to\\_map(world\\_coordinate) set\\_cell\\_item(map\\_coordinate, -1) submitted by /u/Sweaty_Lab9738 [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Hello, I'm making this request for jackbox party pack 3, but I'd be cool with any of them to be honest. I would play this with my family during family game nights that we have pretty often. We normally play games on Netflix like Boggle Party on the living room tv. I've played jackbox party pack 3 many years ago on an Xbox we no longer have and had a fun time playing it. That is why I put this specific one on the request post. I plan to play this on my steam deck and connect it with a dock I currently have connected to our living room tv. I have extended family that I could play this with as well. Since we visit them often and the steam deck is portable, it would not require any extra effort to just bring over my steam deck and its dock. I could even bring this to my friends' dorm rooms at the university I go too. We normally sing karaoke but I think bringing my steam deck and dock over would add some variety. Now that I think about it, I might even be able to figure out a way to play this with online family and friends that don't live close by. I would make great use of a jackbox party game and play it quite often with family and friends. Thanks for taking the time to read this! TLDR: I'd play this game on a docked steam deck during family game nights, with extended family, friends at the university that I attend, and maybe even family and friends that don't live close by. I'd play this game a lot and share fun experiences with many others.

      "content": "I'm on day 67, around 90 hours of gameplay that just flew by and 3 full pages plus a TON of screenshots worth of notes deep into the game and I'm CHERISHING IT. I started hallucinating mechanics irl like the memos, steps, items, computer terminals, drafting plans... Heck, even dreaming about the game overnight. I just (almost) finished solving A New Clue after a LOT of time and some help and it was SO GOOD. The clues were in places I didn't even see the first 5 or 6 times. No joke it probably took me around 30 in game days and 7 different \"borrows\" to get all clues piece by piece. The ones I solved fully on my own were seeing the signs and deciphering their message, annagraming the book names, the entrance hall microchip and finding almost all clues in general . The ones I could solve after a bit of help were <!finding the secret message between the words and knowing that the xyzabc lead referred to the metro map!<. The one I couldn't solve alone was the grotto key (only solved the Ma Jor = small name part, nothing after that) . Now I only need to draft the throne room, see if the words/ binary code on the grotto cutscene mean something (I found the CASTLE word puzzle on the precipice but the other 2 words don't fit in the grid so IDK) and find the \"scorched sundial\" (really intrigued about this one) . Did y'all also need help for this specific puzzle or in the mid-late game in general? Or did you do it alone even though it took weeks of absolutely zero progress? I'm really curious to know and also so I can feel a bit better since I looked up hints a few more times than I would've liked (even though I'm going really slowly) and I hate it.

      "content": "So um like, I don't know if anyone have ever ask this question yet, but what do you guys think about the better way of making money (mid-late game) between honey and ancient fruit wine? Because I think that honey is a better way of making money? For the fist scenario (which mean without ginger island) For a constant, you can only plant 116 ancient fruit in the greenhouse, then with 116 keg you can make [(2,310 x 116) / 7] = 38,280g per day. Even if you have more keg, the amount of limit you have for tiles in greenhouse is 116. And each wine need 6.25, which like 7 days for production of ancient fruit wine. Now if about honey, then it will be how much ever keg you have is each free 220g you got. Because remember, you can buy 1 honey for 200 in oasis by Sandy each Friday, and sell for 420g. If you have 2 optimize 2 big shed, you will have (137 x 2) = 274 keg, each day you can do twice, then [(274 x 2) x (420 - 200)] = 120,560g per day. For the second scenario (which mean with ginger island) You will have unlimited amount of ancient fruit, but then even if like that, if you use the same about as the honey, it would be [(274 x 2,310) / 7] = 90,420g per day So if you like about it, if you have money, bought like 30x stack of 999 honey, and put of keg. Remember, the more keg = more wine fruit but also = more mead, for example, with 4 optimize big shed, you would have make (38,280 x 2) = 241,120g per day with mead and 180,840g per day with ancient fruit, which is 60,280g per day different. Note: The only different is that you have to keg to honey twice per day, which 14 times per which, while ancient fruit only need once per week, but it is really worth it or not? submitted by /u/Technical_Win_9000 to r/StardewValley [link] [comments]",

I’ve been playing this since pre-season and have basically tried & built ever descendant in game currently. I have 5 characters right now that are fully catalyzed; those being(Gley, Valby, Sharen, Luna, and Freyna) but seeing how there is basically nothing else content wise for about 3 weeks I figured i’d max out another Descendant. But honestly idk which one to choose, i use all of them semi-constantly depending on the activity or how I’m feeling given day. If i had to choose my least played characters, it would be Jayber or Keelan. The poll options will show only the characters im actually willing to catalyze, and be used to make my decision of which character I should invest more donuts into. Thank you for your vote. As for the follow up question? Has anyone ever seen a 60 catted Keelan, Jayber, Kyle or Esiemo before in the wild lol? If so what were they doing when you seen them? I play this game every day and still haven’t seen those characters i just mentioned fully maxed. I think i seen a 46 catted Esiemo player in albion once but thats it tbh. They are like exotic creatures or something, especially with the player count being low. I know xAlisa on YouTube has all descendants fully maxed but he can’t be the only one, Right?

I added annotations for the most important information everyone wants to know so you all have a better idea how this was run. Ironically, I was supposed to settle with Web of Shadows because that was an old PC game that I thought can run on a potato, but apparently it cannot. Lol I think this is playable at Balanced gaming mode, but if you want the full experience, you really have to set this to Performance. At that point, you do need a cooler. I reached around 47°C as shown in DevCheck before I exited the game. I won't attempt to push this like before as I want to keep my tablet's life longer. I guess I can settle with emulation for now until the Steam Deck 2 comes out. 😺 INFO : Do not use the steamrip version. It won't work. It's going to tell you no Steam is running in the background.

I added annotations for the most important information everyone wants to know so you all have a better idea how this was run. Ironically, I was supposed to settle with Web of Shadows because that was an old PC game that I thought can run on a potato, but apparently it cannot. Lol I think this is playable at Balanced gaming mode, but if you want the full experience, you really have to set this to Performance. At that point, you do need a cooler. I reached around 47°C as shown in DevCheck before I exited the game. I won't attempt to push this like before as I want to keep my tablet's life longer. I guess I can settle with emulation for now until the Steam Deck 2 comes out. 😺 INFO: Do not use the s***mrip version. It won't work. It's going to tell you no Steam is running in the background. In my case, a D**I (can't say the name as per subreddit rules) works pretty well as shown. submitted by /u/visualmagnitude to r/EmulationOnAndroid [link] [comments]",

Here is how it works: You can earn credits by testing indie games/apps (fun + you help other makers) You can use credits to get your own game tested by real people No fake accounts -> all testers are real users Test more games -> earn more credits -> your game will rank higher -> you get more visibility and more testers/users It's called IndieAppCircle and you can check it out here: https://www.indieappcircle.com/games For uploading your game, you really only need a link to it. You can add a description of the game and a logo so that people know what to expect. You should also add instructions on what people should test (can be very general as well). There are also other categories like web apps, android/ios apps/games or chrome extensions allowed on the platform so there should be enough interesting stuff to test and earn credits! Feel free to leave any questions/feedback/feature suggestions in the comments! Thank you to everyone who joined so far! submitted by /u/luis_411 [link] [comments]",

I'd refresh the page, sort by top/rising/hot, and search for the team names. Most recently the CFB final with Indiana and Miami didn't show up. Not by any search function or sorting in the subreddit, in multireddits, or in All. Searching the post history of the user that posts all these also is blank or behind by a few days. Go to old.reddit.com /r/cfb ? Dozens of posts that don't appear in the app. Makes me wonder how many posts from other subreddits don't make it through and have gone unnoticed.

But anyways I just started playing the free roam and I’m actually pretty disappointed with it. I love the world it’s actually really neat and well put but I’m just disappointed at how empty it feels. The p switch events are fun but there not like full on events that k expected (tho there are good moments here and there) and as someone who plays a lot of racing games like nfs and Forza. It got me wondering why I enjoyed some of there open worlds over Mario karts open world. And it came down to a career mode. Mario kart should have a career mode. With a bunch of races set to have different requirements or challenges and it could make use of the open world and have crazy track ideas that aren’t scene in the Grand Prix. It could have special events like bosses and other challenges that like the ones scene in Mario kart ds or in mkw. But that’s my thoughts how about all of you?

It's a web game based on WebGL and WebAudio, so no download just play in browser, and totally free, no mandatory login(unless you'd like to share your town with a link) If you give it a try, I'd be incredibly grateful, and welcome of and feedbacks or suggestions. submitted by /u/zyhyysh [link] [comments]",

So i have been quite out of the loop when it comes to changes, metas etc. Had quite a few T10's in various lines from BB to CA/CL and DD and played those 3 classes roughly equal amounts over about 5k battles. Comming back a lot seems changed and i ended up resetting all T10 lines, so i started from below, just to get back into the flow if things and not be a liability. At the same time i feel that i am very much wanting to focus on DD and CA/CL as i have had most fun in those. Ships with as little RNG as possible (excluding fire /flood). So with the current build of the game what are strong, not necessarily meta/fomo, but also fun lines to go for. From before i always liked cruisers like Atago and Zao, Minotaur, Blyska and the US destroyers were quite nice too, as well as the Dakka japanese DD's (really CL's). So besides those i played, of all the newer countries, which lines hold up at medium to high tier?

      "content": "I’ve been thinking about why Hytale feels so different from modern Minecraft, and it keeps coming back to leadership. Simon (Hypixel Studios) feels like the Notch we never really got to keep. Early Notch-era Minecraft was lightning in a bottle: weird, experimental, community-driven. But over time—especially under Mojang/Microsoft—it’s started to feel corporate-first. Updates lack a clear vision, features get teased then shelved, and decisions often feel disconnected from what players actually ask for. Minecraft is massive, but it often feels like a product being managed, not a world being loved. Contrast that with Simon and Hytale. From day one, Hytale has been presented as a passion project built with the community, not just for it. Dev blogs are transparent, feedback is acknowledged, and there’s a clear creative direction. Even the preorder approach says a lot: no exclusive gameplay items, no FOMO-driven cosmetics locked forever behind a paywall. That’s a huge signal that they care more about trust than short-term profit. To me, that’s the real difference. Hytale feels like an evolving world guided by developers who genuinely care and listen. Minecraft feels like an IP stuck between nostalgia, corporate caution, and a lack of bold direction. Notch gave us the spark, but Simon seems to have learned the lesson: protect the soul of the game, respect the community, and don’t let greed steer the ship. If Hytale succeeds, it won’t just be because it’s a good game—it’ll be because of that philosophy. submitted by /u/No-Doughnut9305 to r/hytale [link] [comments]",

I suddenly remembered my old posts about What AAA Studio should Work on A Murder Drones Game on The MD Subs. And that combined with how expansive TADC is. I thought why not make A Sequel Post but for A Different Show However unlike MD I feel like A TADC Game Regardless if it's made by A Indie Studio, AAA Studio, etc. It still has alot of potential. But for now I wanna see The Execution on How An AAA/AA Studio would make A TADC Game. Maybe later on in the future I could make another post but for Indie Studios instead. I do plan on doing that And to be honest, considering how expansive TADC is. I feel like it could explore multiple genres of Games due to how the circus has different places to explore. Whether the game takes place in one single adventure or multiple adventures + the circus itself. But for me Personally I would LOVE Telltale if they were still here to this day to make A Choice-Based Game like The Walking Dead based on TADC. submitted by /u/hunter47685 to r/theamazingdigitalciru [link] [comments]",

Over time, I tried a few options and also spent some time using Incogniton. I liked being able to manage many profiles in one place, especially for social media and e-commerce accounts. It made things way easier to handle. After a while, I started noticing small things. Nothing really disappears. Even with separate profiles, small patterns still show up over time. That’s when it hit me, the browser isn’t doing most of the work.

Another component i use very frequently in the game i'm currently working on, plays a plop-up animation on UI elements every time they are enabled. This natively creates an animation on top of the panels just appearing. I think, the result is very satisfying to use and look at! What do you guys think? submitted by /u/hdydworld [link] [comments]",

I only care that I can legit get my save into the Pokemon home thing so I can collect all the Pokemon I played emerald on an emulator, and I liked it So I bought a used switch and am enjoying diamond and I am 99% sure I will like arceus So I wanna make sure I’m understanding basically what id need to do, given the legacy stuff is so old Gen 1-3=-gameboy or DS with the game boy slot Gen 4-7 = 3ds 8+ = switch But it seems there’s event stuff from the past that I can’t get the Pokemon from. So are there any/many of gen 1-3 that are not in 4-7. - unsure, but I’m least interested in these as they’re old asf and seemingly poor QOL And are there any in 4-7 that can’t be gotten on switch - pretty sure there are ones I’d miss cause there’s lots of games in this era. But not sure how many. The DS was huuuge when I was a kid. And I missed out so. Wanna see what there is to see. I know I can trade and such. But, idk if I’m looking at 20-30 trades or like 100-150 that can’t be gotten at all thru the switch I also have Pokemon go.
