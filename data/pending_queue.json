I can be really clingy with the right person and would prefer someone who is equally clingy. I want you to text me a lot! Some of my interests include nutrition (though my takes have been called controversial and unsafe), swimming, gaming, anime, manga, nature and I used to love writing too but it's been a while since I've written anything. I would also be happy to hear you yap or vent. I love arguing and/or discussing various topics so feel free to speak about anything you'd like to and I'd be happy to your questions. Here's to hoping we both make a cool new friend! Feel free to DM me submitted by /u/GoodNightPupun to r/MakeNewFriendsHere [link] [comments]",

Here is how it works: You can earn credits by testing indie games/apps (fun + you help other makers) You can use credits to get your own game tested by real people No fake accounts -> all testers are real users Test more games -> earn more credits -> your game will rank higher -> you get more visibility and more testers/users It's called IndieAppCircle and you can check it out here: https://www.indieappcircle.com/games For uploading your game, you really only need a link to it. You can add a description of the game and a logo so that people know what to expect. You should also add instructions on what people should test (can be very general as well). There are also other categories like web apps, android/iOS apps/games or chrome extensions allowed on the platform so there should be enough interesting stuff to test and earn credits! Feel free to leave any questions/feedback/feature suggestions in the comments! Thank you to everyone who joined so far! submitted by /u/luis_411 [link] [comments]",

      "content": "I'm talking about things that don't affect gameplay but you wouldn't do in FM because of some real life connection. The most classic example would be managing your team's rival, of course even if it was the most fun save that everyone was suggesting, you probably wouldn't manage Man Utd as a Man City fan. But that's the most obvious one (also signing Greenwood and other such scum). However I'm taking about less obvious stuff than these two examples. Also everything is connected to real life of course, Man City is good in game because they're good IRL but I'm talking mostly about things that don't affect gameplay (Greenwood is just code in-game and a decent player in the engine). I'll start with one (or two) examples that are a bit less obvious. Many people start lower league saves with non-historic clubs, maybe it's their local club, maybe they have the best badge, maybe they're the worst in the league etc. I however can't bring myself to manage one of the least-supported clubs in the league, even if I start in the lower leagues, I'm definitely picking the fallen giant with a big fan base for the level. This has gameplay implications of course with higher attendances and revenue but that's not my reason for doing it at all. I want to feel like I'm making lots of people happy and that I can feel part of the team by searching about them and finding some resources. I also can't pick a \"plastic\" club such as MK Dons, even ones with fans, because they've been turned into an RB club for example.

This is because of a key feature in all these games known as \"multi select\" losing its ability to work. With the new release of roblox switching the input for Ctrl from the \"command\" key to the \"control\" key on MacOS devices, all systems that used to require the input of the command key, including multi-selecting objects in creator games no longer work. To reproduce this simply go into a game like \"Tower Creator\" or \"Obby Creator\" on a mac device and try selecting multiple objects while holding down the command/control key. What I found most peculiar is how roblox studio still uses command+c and command+click for cloning and multi-select respectively yet actual roblox games had their MacOS keybinds changed causing issues. Would really appreciate if this got decent traction cause it's causing me and a lot of other mac users alot of trouble trying to build things and if anyone reading this has dev forum posting access I would heavily appreciate awareness being brought to this issue. submitted by /u/Negative-Courage2889 to r/robloxgamedev [link] [comments]",

But now that he’s learned to sit (almost independently, he can’t get into sitting position on his own but he can get out of it) he just doesn’t want to be in tummy time during his wake windows. He does sleep on his belly (he rolls over to sleep) and is maybe getting a combined 45mins a day of tummy time now. But he won’t last more than 10 mins per session without getting upset that he wants to sit when before he would just play in tummy time for 30mins a session. He’s almost 7m, can’t crawl yet but, can move/pivot well on his belly. Any advice to make this better for him?

      "content": "So, I have been thinking more than a little about Freedom from WoF recently since I have been drawing her lately, and the concept is so out of place I love it (the concept, not the execution. A hive mind plant that's controlled by the souls of a dragonet and human that died long ago is quite out there, probably the weirdest thing I've read about. ). Turns out dragon stories can have that sort of things, though my opinion on them differs. I don't find the fact dragons arrive in meteors in the Dragonheart movie series to be that strange, perhaps because I was already found of the idea and planned to implement it in my stories. But I totally see why anyone would find that reveal weird. I also don't find the reveal \"X fantasy setting is earth in the future\" that strange either, but that has to do with the fact I imagine the author wanted to add in some grand twist. Basically I stop thinking about the in universe aspect and begin thinking about the meta/writing reasoning part, which is a personal thing. I guess the Legend of Spyro has its own weird stuff, but for the purple derg it is totally inspired from avatar, and for the rest I consider strange in it... Well, the whole golem thing, the Destroyer and making a new world (literally) is appealing enough, but i see it more as way for the devs to stupidly up the stakes. There is just not enough focus and foreshadowing to really flesh out the ideas in my opinion, especially since it ignores the lore of the previous games. submitted by /u/Ofynam to r/WyrmWorks [link] [comments]",

Not really anything positive can be taken from yesterday. Having had some time to think it over I still think he’ll he given the next two seasons to prove he’s the long term answer at QB for us. I’ve no doubt there’s the talent there but the decision making and mentality for me are under serious questioning. I know we’ve changed OC and we were down a few keys guys last night but to play that poorly is simply unacceptable. In terms of the future I struggle to see us doing anything other than keep Stroud on. No chance we trade for a big time QB simply due to the cap cost of someone like Burrow, Herbert etc (putting to one side how unlikely it would be to get them). In terms of moving Stroud on maybe a team like the Jets, Browns etc maybe give us a first for him but I find it unlikely I guess my confusion is how we went from him balling out rookie year to this season where he’s been poor quite often (yes had some great moments) but the last two games he’s looked like a deer in the headlights Got to hope he puts a power of work in during the offseason and between Caley and Ryans can get the message through to him that it’s now or never for his future at the Texans submitted by /u/Relevant-Goose5483 to r/Texans [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Just a PSA. We have a lot of questions in this sub from people looking to get started. They want advice on what to do, where to go, what engine to pick, what game to make, etc etc. One of the things that helps set game developers up for success, IMHO, is the ability to do your own research and help yourself. If you've done some research into your question, come here and tell us what research you have already done and what you have found. That makes it easier for us to help you. If you ask for help having done nothing yourself, it's difficult for people to help you. Or rather, why should they? A wealth of material exists to help answer those basic questions - consult those first before asking for help. If you want to succeed as a game developer, you need to master the skill of researching things yourself and finding solutions to new problems. You'll never build a game if you just post on reddit any time you get stuck. During the development of your game, you will encounter problems that no one else has ever seen, and its your job to solve them. You can ask for help and advice, sure, but if you don't learn to help yourself at least part of the time, you won't make it. I don't mean to sound harsh. But its the truth. Learn to help yourself. Develop those research skills - they are a lot more important than you think, and they apply to more than just games. submitted by /u/AngelOfLastResort [link] [comments]",

On the other hand, the Godot editor’s integration is too good to give up for a separate windowed setup. I’ve been looking at how vscode-neovim embeds a real Nvim instance as a backend. Has anyone explored a similar GDExtension for Godot? I’d love to know if there are major architectural blockers that have stopped this from becoming a standard plugin. I’m not a C++ expert so maybe bootstrapping something like that myself is beyond my current skillset, but I’d love to contribute in any way I can if a project like this is already in the works!

The base ordering/inventory/auction UI system is locked in. My ledger connects to my inventory manager and allows the player to place bids, order wholesale and view stocked inventory. I got a lot of work done on the NPC systems including spawning, taking books from shelves, queuing, placing books on counter and exiting shop. I even installed a rudimentary pathing system so they don't get stuck as easily on objects, and I also added a feature that lets the player push the NPCs around, so even if they get stuck you can push them around.

It was funny at first but now it irks me. I think it’s downright unattractive and really puts me off him when he gets like it. He’s always tired, never wants to do anything, I gave up a lot for him to be with him, which isn’t a problem necessarily, but when I look at what I got for my efforts it really makes me a bit resentful. I keep telling him to go to the doctor in case there’s an underlying issue, he won’t. He’s lazy about his health. He’s always going on about how little sleep he got the night before, but I know that’s BS because I’ve been awake several times for long periods during the night and know he was sleeping soundly at the time he says he was awake. He’s been tested for sleep apnea so it’s not that. It seems to be this bragging game - who has it the hardest? I’m sick of it. It’s getting to the stage where I’m just not feeling physically attracted anymore. Anyway, rant over, thanks for reading. submitted by /u/ShadowSelf80 to r/Marriage [link] [comments]",

I know that sounds dumb as hell. At the time, I actually never really thought about how the balls would carry over at all. Of course it does make sense why they went with the strange ball route, but I still wish it would've just been regular balls instead. It's such a shame because I think PLA is imo one of the best Pokemom games ever made, it terms of atmosphere. I loved just being in it while doing monotonous tasks like hunting or gathering materials. Jubilife Village's theme has got to be one of the best game tracks I've ever heard. I get warm goosebumps anytime I hear it in Youtube videos i watch. I'm coping for a way to eventually swap pokeballs (albeit very restrictive of course) in a future game.

      "content": "The majority of game developers reccomend that you splash a substantial amount of cash on getting a professional steam capsule made for your indie game, but spending something like $500-700 on capsule art seems insane to me. Is it really that worth it? My game's wishlist count is very low at the moment (50, increasing by ~1 a day), so that kind of money could be unwise since it might mean my game doesn't make any ROI. At the same time though, I am hoping that releasing a demo would give my game a lot more coverage by streamers and having good capsule art for that is incredibly important. So it feels like a chicken-and-egg situation where I don't know for sure wether my game will be successful enough to make a commission worth it, but at the same time my game could get a lot more coverage if I had one. It's a bit of a gamble is what I'm saying. Don't get me wrong, that isn't the only thing about my steam page which might be reducing wishlists (all of which I am working on), but the capsule art definitely seems to be the biggest white elephant. Peoples reactions to the game on social media have been small but very positive recently which gives me confidence but I don't know if that equates the same as being successful enough to earn more than the $800 I will have to spend to make it. Is it worth it? I would love to know what you think, especially people who have done the same. My steam store page purely for reference. submitted by /u/spicedruid [link] [comments]",

Both would contrast with similar egg throwing physics and suction for egg production. Yoshi uses his tongue to pull in enemies and Birdo could use her mouth for suction at close range. Initially It seem to have work mostly in favor for Baby Mario due to the wider arsenal of mechanics. You could go more in depth and level locked stages per partner, Birdo having slightly different mechanics than Yoshi. For transformations, a balloon, vacuum cleaner, dump truck and wrecking ball seem to make the most sense for Birdo. submitted by /u/DajuanKev to r/Mario [link] [comments]",

Your unit count varies, at most 12-13. 2)In my game map every tile influences the unit on them in different ways. Sometimes negatively, sometimes positively. In game there will be things that makes these negative effects useful, but I still think player will never want their units on these negative hexes and they will feel very unlucky when their unit landed on them. Is it too much rng? (Since game is an auto battler they dont have direct control over where the unit will go during battle.) Do you know any games with too many unit stats, around 20-25. Do you know any games that has hexes that effects the units negatively, but you dont have complete control if unit goes there, it is part of the risk management submitted by /u/whyNamesTurkiye [link] [comments]",

Not even speaking from a \"Blazer fans are already a shafted minority and deserve their happy ending\" perspective like he's saying here, but I feel like Mandy, while being disappointed in Robert's decision to kill Shroud (as she is in the final game), would also completely understand Robert's feelings and what led him to make that decision - even more so if you chose the option where Robert acknowledges that it wasn't a morally \"right\" thing to do. She even laughs at his \"It was kinda like masturbating\" comparison. Mandy had already threatened to kill people at the bar when rescuing Robert from Shroud (obviously not the same thing as murdering someone you've already beaten, but still). I feel like she'd also understand how personal it was to Robert considering what Shroud did to his father. I don't think she'd be the kind of person to distance herself from him over that decision. submitted by /u/FallingBullfrog to r/DispatchAdHoc [link] [comments]",

      "content": "I feel like i’m not getting nearly enough playing time on my team as a senior and I don’t know what to do. For starters, my small high school team is 2-9 this year. We have one actually good player and everyone else is decent. I have the least amount of minutes on the team and I’m the tallest player. I posted stats from the season and I have the least amount of minutes (#20). #2 is the player who plays ahead of me. I play at the 5 position and in practice we just run plays like robots where i’m standing at the block. I never get the chance to show the coaches I can actually play but I’ve ran with my team with no coaches and freedom and I look like the best player out there, even ahead of our one good player. I’m stuck in an endless cycle of not being able to prove my worth to the coaches. I get in for the last 5 minutes of the game when we’re already down 30 points and i’m cold off the bench and I can’t show them in practice because i’m pinned to the post. I’m scared talking to him will just make him play me even less because he has told people i’m the worst player on the team. What should I do? If I talk to him what should I ask him? Sorry, this was a bit of a rant, I’m just fed up with losing games and feeling like I could help but am never given the chance. submitted by /u/alex91200 to r/BasketballTips [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Eins direkt vorweg: Das Thema Gesundheit ist für mich schon immer eine Herzensangelegenheit gewesen. Aber Hand aufs Herz, im Dschungel der unzähligen Gesundheits-Tipps, Diäten und Wundermittel verliert man schnell den Überblick. Was mich neugierig auf das OPUS MAGNUM – Völlige Gesundheit (VIP-Paket) gemacht hat, war die Aussicht auf einen ganzheitlichen Ansatz. Nicht nur Symptome bekämpfen, sondern die Wurzeln meiner Gesundheitsprobleme verstehen und angehen. Ich wollte wissen, ob dieses Programm wirklich das Potenzial hat, mein Wohlbefinden auf ein neues Level zu heben. Also habe ich mich entschieden, es für dich (und natürlich auch für mich selbst!) genauer unter die Lupe zu nehmen. JETZT MEHR ERFAHREN → Was ist OPUS MAGNUM – Völlige Gesundheit (VIP-Paket)?

Ernährung oder Fitness), betrachtet OPUS MAGNUM den Menschen als Ganzes. Es geht um körperliche, geistige und seelische Gesundheit im Zusammenspiel. **Wissenschaftlich fundiertes Wissen:** Die Inhalte basieren auf aktuellen wissenschaftlichen Erkenntnissen und werden verständlich aufbereitet.

Das macht es leicht, ins Handeln zu kommen. **Umfangreiches VIP-Paket:** Das VIP-Paket bietet zusätzlichen Support, tiefere Einblicke und exklusive Inhalte, die über das Standardprogramm hinausgehen. Das Gefühl, besonders betreut zu werden, empfand ich als sehr wertvoll. Was bekommst du konkret? Das VIP-Paket ist wirklich prall gefüllt und lässt kaum Wünsche offen. Hier ein Überblick, was du alles erwarten kannst: **Umfassende Videolektionen:** Hochwertig produzierte Videos, die komplexe Themen einfach und anschaulich erklären. Ich habe gemerkt, wie viel Mühe hier in die Didaktik gesteckt wurde. **Interaktive Arbeitsbücher und Leitfäden:** Begleitmaterial, das dir hilft, das Gelernte zu vertiefen und direkt anzuwenden. Ich fand es super, dass ich mir Notizen machen und meine Fortschritte verfolgen konnte. **Exklusive VIP-Boni:** Dazu gehören oft zusätzliche Masterclasses, Live-Q&A-Sessions mit Experten oder Zugang zu einer exklusiven Community. Diese direkten Austauschmöglichkeiten waren für mich ein echtes Highlight. **Meditations- und Entspannungsübungen:** Spezielle Anleitungen, um den Geist zu beruhigen und Stress abzubauen. Ich habe einige davon fest in meine Abendroutine integriert. **Ernährungspläne und Rezeptsammlungen:** Konkrete Vorschläge für eine gesunde und genussvolle Ernährung, die leicht umzusetzen sind. **Bewegungsroutinen:** Anleitungen für einfache, aber effektive Übungen, die du zu Hause durchführen kannst, um deine körperliche Fitness zu verbessern. **Regelmäßige Updates und Erweiterungen:** Das Programm wird kontinuierlich weiterentwickelt und um neue Inhalte ergänzt, sodass du immer auf dem neuesten Stand bleibst. https://preview.redd.it/m2hlcjlgodeg1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e8ef90ac69d529f15b1dd252782721b9a50ce67 JETZT MEHR ERFAHREN → Mein Test: So habe ich OPUS MAGNUM – Völlige Gesundheit (VIP-Paket) erlebt Als ich mit dem OPUS MAGNUM – Völlige Gesundheit (VIP-Paket) gestartet bin, war ich gespannt, ob es meinen Erwartungen gerecht werden würde. Und ich muss sagen: Es hat wirklich überzeugt! Mein erster Eindruck war die hohe Qualität der Videolektionen. Die Inhalte sind nicht nur fundiert, sondern auch sehr motivierend aufbereitet. Ich habe mich nie gelangweilt gefühlt, sondern immer das Gefühl gehabt, etwas Neues und Wertvolles zu lernen. Was mich besonders überrascht hat, war die Tiefe, mit der auf die mentalen Aspekte der Gesundheit eingegangen wird. Ich hatte erwartet, viel über Ernährung und Bewegung zu lernen (was ich auch getan habe!), aber die Lektionen zu Stressmanagement, Achtsamkeit und positiver Psychologie waren für mich ein echter Game Changer. Ich habe gelernt, besser mit Druck umzugehen und meine Gedanken bewusster zu steuern. Die Meditationsübungen waren anfangs eine kleine Herausforderung für mich, aber mit der Zeit konnte ich eine deutliche Verbesserung meiner Konzentration und inneren Ruhe feststellen. Ich habe über einen Zeitraum von mehreren Wochen die Empfehlungen zur Ernährung umgesetzt und bin begeistert, wie einfach es war, kleine Veränderungen mit großer Wirkung zu erzielen. Ich fühle mich energiegeladener und meine Verdauung hat sich spürbar verbessert. Auch die Integration der Bewegungseinheiten in meinen Alltag fiel mir leichter, als ich dachte. Es geht nicht darum, sich zu quälen, sondern darum, den Körper auf eine Weise zu stärken, die Freude macht. Der Austausch in der VIP-Community war ebenfalls ein großer Pluspunkt. Es ist motivierend, sich mit Gleichgesinnten auszutauschen, Fragen zu stellen und Unterstützung zu finden. Das Gefühl, nicht allein auf diesem Weg zu sein, hat mir zusätzlich Auftrieb gegeben. Für wen lohnt sich OPUS MAGNUM – Völlige Gesundheit (VIP-Paket)? Das OPUS MAGNUM – Völlige Gesundheit (VIP-Paket) ist meiner Meinung nach für eine breite Zielgruppe geeignet, die ihre Gesundheit wirklich ernst nimmt und bereit ist, aktiv daran zu arbeiten. **Menschen, die nach einem ganzheitlichen Gesundheitskonzept suchen:** Wenn du genug davon hast, dich nur auf einzelne Symptome zu konzentrieren und stattdessen die Ursachen deiner Beschwerden angehen möchtest. **Personen, die ihre Energie und Vitalität steigern wollen:** Wenn du dich oft müde, ausgelaugt oder energielos fühlst und nach Wegen suchst, deine Lebenskraft zu reaktivieren. **Jeder, der Stress reduzieren und mentale Klarheit gewinnen möchte:** Wenn du unter Stress leidest, dich schwer konzentrieren kannst oder einfach mehr innere Ruhe suchst. **Gesundheitsbewusste, die ihr Wissen vertiefen möchten:** Wenn du bereits an deiner Gesundheit arbeitest, aber noch fundiertere Informationen und konkrete Strategien suchst. **Einsteiger, die einen klaren Fahrplan brauchen:** Wenn du noch am Anfang deines Gesundheitsweges stehst und eine strukturierte Anleitung benötigst. Kritische Punkte / Worauf du achten musst Obwohl ich vom OPUS MAGNUM – Völlige Gesundheit (VIP-Paket) sehr überzeugt bin, gibt es ein paar Punkte, die du beachten solltest, um realistische Erwartungen zu haben: **Keine schnelle Lösung:** Das Programm verspricht keine Wunder über Nacht. Es erfordert Zeit, Engagement und die Bereitschaft, Gewohnheiten zu ändern. Wer eine Sofortlösung sucht, wird hier vielleicht enttäuscht sein. **Eigenverantwortung ist gefragt:** Die Inhalte sind hervorragend, aber du musst sie auch aktiv umsetzen. Niemand kann die Arbeit für dich erledigen. Deine eigene Motivation ist entscheidend für den Erfolg. **Preisliche Investition:** Das VIP-Paket ist eine Investition. Auch wenn der Mehrwert meiner Meinung nach den Preis rechtfertigt, solltest du dir bewusst sein, dass es kein Low-Budget-Produkt ist. Überlege, ob du bereit bist, diesen Betrag für deine Gesundheit zu investieren. **Informationsflut am Anfang:** Gerade zu Beginn kann die Menge an Informationen überwältigend wirken. Nimm dir die Zeit, alles in deinem Tempo durchzugehen und dich nicht unter Druck zu setzen. Mein Fazit zu OPUS MAGNUM – Völlige Gesundheit (VIP-Paket) Mein persönliches Fazit zum OPUS MAGNUM – Völlige Gesundheit (VIP-Paket) fällt durchweg positiv aus. Ich habe in den letzten Wochen so viel über meinen Körper, meinen Geist und die Zusammenhänge gelernt, wie selten zuvor. Das Programm ist extrem gut strukturiert, die Inhalte sind fundiert und die Umsetzung in den Alltag ist dank der praktischen Anleitungen wirklich machbar. Ich fühle mich nicht nur körperlich fitter und energiegeladener, sondern auch mental ausgeglichener. Es ist eine Investition in deine Gesundheit, die sich meiner Meinung nach langfristig auszahlt. Wenn du bereit bist, aktiv an deiner \"Völligen Gesundheit\" zu arbeiten und einen ganzheitlichen Weg suchst, dann kann ich dir das OPUS MAGNUM – Völlige Gesundheit (VIP-Paket) wärmstens empfehlen. Es ist ein wertvoller Begleiter auf dem Weg zu einem vitaleren und glücklicheren Leben. JETZT MEHR ERFAHREN → submitted by /u/Glittering-Sundae228 to r/DigiVertrau [link] [comments]",

I am nevertheless a bit conflicted going forward because, on the one hand the next gen Xbox sounds like it will carry all my previously purchased console games with the added benefit of PC storefronts. On the other hand I am a bit burned out from the constant rake-stepping decisions from Microsoft and Steam has such good will with its consumers. I’m also unsure of how future proof the Steam machine will be based on reports of its weaker than expected specs. I know that we don’t have all the needed information to make an informed decision yet, but am curious what everyone’s initial thoughts and leanings are? submitted by /u/Fickle_Barber9863 to r/consoles [link] [comments]",

As far as class and playstyle, one wants to dual wield DK dps and the other wants some kind of nightblade dps. Is it realistic for me to both tank and heal? I’m thinking warden maybe? Or Templar?

You can probably tell that I'm not so knowledgeable on the topic lol. Anyway, I want to make a drinking game where everyone at the party has a piece of paper with a picture of a tank on it, and at some point in the night they show it to my friend. If he can guess the tank the person with the paper drinks, if he can't guess it then he drinks. The only problem is I don't know anything about tanks! So I'm hoping to get some help coming up with a list of about 15 tanks with names and pictures for my friend to guess. Ideally he'd get about 3/4 of them right (it is a party for him after all) with a range of difficulty. He did used to play a lot of war thunder and watch YouTubers who do war game content if that helps get an idea of how hard to make it.

This could be related to context rot --- i have not had todo item issues since compacting at 50%.

However, when I try to access the texture, I can get the array but not the items in it. Here's my code: panel / itemPanel.gd (UI node i want to hold the image in): extends Panel var item: TextureRect = $aspRect/color/item var player: CharacterBody3D = $\"../player\" const FL_STUDIO = preload(\"uid://cky184lm61gh3\") @export var itemSlot: int # Called every frame. 'delta' is the elapsed time since the previous frame. func _process(delta: float) -> void: if player: item.texture = FL_STUDIO print(player.heldItems.values().get(itemSlot)) body / body.gd (AreaBody2D, child of a parent node, iconName and iconTxtr are vars within a script in the parent node): extends Area3D var parent: Node3D = $\"..\" @onready var mesh: MeshInstance3D = $\"../mesh\" func _on_body_entered(body: Node3D) -> void: if body.heldItems.size() < body.maxItems: var items = body.heldItems var itemStats: Array = [parent.itemName, parent.changeHealth, parent.iconTxtr] items[items.size()] = itemStats parent.queue_free() else: print(\"inventory full!\") Right now this accesses the array I need within the dictionary, but I can't actually get the values out of the arrays. I had attempted to look up the answer but had found no solution. Whenever I try to access the values in the array, I get error message \"Invalid access to property or key 'itemSlot' on a base object of type 'Dictionary[int, Array]'.\" It appears the error is on line 14 of itemPanel.gd.

      "content": "Hello, I'm making this request for jackbox party pack 3, but I'd be cool with any of them to be honest. I would play this with my family during family game nights that we have pretty often. We normally play games on Netflix like Boggle Party on the living room tv. I've played jackbox party pack 3 many years ago on an Xbox we no longer have and had a fun time playing it. That is why I put this specific one on the request post. I plan to play this on my steam deck and connect it with a dock I currently have connected to our living room tv. I have extended family that I could play this with as well. Since we visit them often and the steam deck is portable, it would not require any extra effort to just bring over my steam deck and its dock. I could even bring this to my friends' dorm rooms at the university I go too. We normally sing karaoke but I think bringing my steam deck and dock over would add some variety. Now that I think about it, I might even be able to figure out a way to play this with online family and friends that don't live close by. I would make great use of a jackbox party game and play it quite often with family and friends. Thanks for taking the time to read this! TLDR: I'd play this game on a docked steam deck during family game nights, with extended family, friends at the university that I attend, and maybe even family and friends that don't live close by. I'd play this game a lot and share fun experiences with many others.

I started hallucinating mechanics irl like the memos, steps, items, computer terminals, drafting plans... Heck, even dreaming about the game overnight. I just (almost) finished solving A New Clue after a LOT of time and some help and it was SO GOOD. The clues were in places I didn't even see the first 5 or 6 times. No joke it probably took me around 30 in game days and 7 different \"borrows\" to get all clues piece by piece. The ones I solved fully on my own were seeing the signs and deciphering their message, annagraming the book names, the entrance hall microchip and finding almost all clues in general . The ones I could solve after a bit of help were <!finding the secret message between the words and knowing that the xyzabc lead referred to the metro map!<. The one I couldn't solve alone was the grotto key (only solved the Ma Jor = small name part, nothing after that) . Now I only need to draft the throne room, see if the words/ binary code on the grotto cutscene mean something (I found the CASTLE word puzzle on the precipice but the other 2 words don't fit in the grid so IDK) and find the \"scorched sundial\" (really intrigued about this one) . Did y'all also need help for this specific puzzle or in the mid-late game in general? Or did you do it alone even though it took weeks of absolutely zero progress? I'm really curious to know and also so I can feel a bit better since I looked up hints a few more times than I would've liked (even though I'm going really slowly) and I hate it.

      "content": "So um like, I don't know if anyone have ever ask this question yet, but what do you guys think about the better way of making money (mid-late game) between honey and ancient fruit wine? Because I think that honey is a better way of making money? For the fist scenario (which mean without ginger island) For a constant, you can only plant 116 ancient fruit in the greenhouse, then with 116 keg you can make [(2,310 x 116) / 7] = 38,280g per day. Even if you have more keg, the amount of limit you have for tiles in greenhouse is 116. And each wine need 6.25, which like 7 days for production of ancient fruit wine. Now if about honey, then it will be how much ever keg you have is each free 220g you got. Because remember, you can buy 1 honey for 200 in oasis by Sandy each Friday, and sell for 420g. If you have 2 optimize 2 big shed, you will have (137 x 2) = 274 keg, each day you can do twice, then [(274 x 2) x (420 - 200)] = 120,560g per day. For the second scenario (which mean with ginger island) You will have unlimited amount of ancient fruit, but then even if like that, if you use the same about as the honey, it would be [(274 x 2,310) / 7] = 90,420g per day So if you like about it, if you have money, bought like 30x stack of 999 honey, and put of keg. Remember, the more keg = more wine fruit but also = more mead, for example, with 4 optimize big shed, you would have make (38,280 x 2) = 241,120g per day with mead and 180,840g per day with ancient fruit, which is 60,280g per day different. Note: The only different is that you have to keg to honey twice per day, which 14 times per which, while ancient fruit only need once per week, but it is really worth it or not? submitted by /u/Technical_Win_9000 to r/StardewValley [link] [comments]",

I’ve been playing this since pre-season and have basically tried & built ever descendant in game currently. I have 5 characters right now that are fully catalyzed; those being(Gley, Valby, Sharen, Luna, and Freyna) but seeing how there is basically nothing else content wise for about 3 weeks I figured i’d max out another Descendant. But honestly idk which one to choose, i use all of them semi-constantly depending on the activity or how I’m feeling given day. If i had to choose my least played characters, it would be Jayber or Keelan. The poll options will show only the characters im actually willing to catalyze, and be used to make my decision of which character I should invest more donuts into. Thank you for your vote. As for the follow up question? Has anyone ever seen a 60 catted Keelan, Jayber, Kyle or Esiemo before in the wild lol? If so what were they doing when you seen them? I play this game every day and still haven’t seen those characters i just mentioned fully maxed. I think i seen a 46 catted Esiemo player in albion once but thats it tbh. They are like exotic creatures or something, especially with the player count being low. I know xAlisa on YouTube has all descendants fully maxed but he can’t be the only one, Right?

Any time I look up level design, I get the principles and concepts like gates, objectives and goal, progression one way doors. I'm looking more in terms of visual presentation of a level. Anything of the sort? submitted by /u/TheConceptBoy [link] [comments]",

Here is how it works: You can earn credits by testing indie games/apps (fun + you help other makers) You can use credits to get your own game tested by real people No fake accounts -> all testers are real users Test more games -> earn more credits -> your game will rank higher -> you get more visibility and more testers/users It's called IndieAppCircle and you can check it out here: https://www.indieappcircle.com/games For uploading your game, you really only need a link to it. You can add a description of the game and a logo so that people know what to expect. You should also add instructions on what people should test (can be very general as well). There are also other categories like web apps, android/ios apps/games or chrome extensions allowed on the platform so there should be enough interesting stuff to test and earn credits!

      "content": "Noticed a potential bug that I'm curious to see what's up. I follow a few sports subreddits. Oftentimes posts that I know should exist don't show up. For instance, throughough the college football season, the /r/cfb subreddit would be missing Game Day Thread and Post Game Thread posts. I'd refresh the page, sort by top/rising/hot, and search for the team names. Most recently the CFB final with Indiana and Miami didn't show up. Not by any search function or sorting in the subreddit, in multireddits, or in All. Searching the post history of the user that posts all these also is blank or behind by a few days. Go to old.reddit.com /r/cfb ? Dozens of posts that don't appear in the app. Makes me wonder how many posts from other subreddits don't make it through and have gone unnoticed. Any tips for having all posts come through or having user post history show up? submitted by /u/AJTTOTD to r/narwhalapp [link] [comments]",

The p switch events are fun but there not like full on events that k expected (tho there are good moments here and there) and as someone who plays a lot of racing games like nfs and Forza. It got me wondering why I enjoyed some of there open worlds over Mario karts open world. And it came down to a career mode. Mario kart should have a career mode. With a bunch of races set to have different requirements or challenges and it could make use of the open world and have crazy track ideas that aren’t scene in the Grand Prix. It could have special events like bosses and other challenges that like the ones scene in Mario kart ds or in mkw. But that’s my thoughts how about all of you?

So i have been quite out of the loop when it comes to changes, metas etc. Had quite a few T10's in various lines from BB to CA/CL and DD and played those 3 classes roughly equal amounts over about 5k battles. Comming back a lot seems changed and i ended up resetting all T10 lines, so i started from below, just to get back into the flow if things and not be a liability. At the same time i feel that i am very much wanting to focus on DD and CA/CL as i have had most fun in those. Ships with as little RNG as possible (excluding fire /flood). So with the current build of the game what are strong, not necessarily meta/fomo, but also fun lines to go for. From before i always liked cruisers like Atago and Zao, Minotaur, Blyska and the US destroyers were quite nice too, as well as the Dakka japanese DD's (really CL's). So besides those i played, of all the newer countries, which lines hold up at medium to high tier?

      "content": "I’ve been thinking about why Hytale feels so different from modern Minecraft, and it keeps coming back to leadership. Simon (Hypixel Studios) feels like the Notch we never really got to keep. Early Notch-era Minecraft was lightning in a bottle: weird, experimental, community-driven. But over time—especially under Mojang/Microsoft—it’s started to feel corporate-first. Updates lack a clear vision, features get teased then shelved, and decisions often feel disconnected from what players actually ask for. Minecraft is massive, but it often feels like a product being managed, not a world being loved. Contrast that with Simon and Hytale. From day one, Hytale has been presented as a passion project built with the community, not just for it. Dev blogs are transparent, feedback is acknowledged, and there’s a clear creative direction. Even the preorder approach says a lot: no exclusive gameplay items, no FOMO-driven cosmetics locked forever behind a paywall. That’s a huge signal that they care more about trust than short-term profit. To me, that’s the real difference. Hytale feels like an evolving world guided by developers who genuinely care and listen. Minecraft feels like an IP stuck between nostalgia, corporate caution, and a lack of bold direction. Notch gave us the spark, but Simon seems to have learned the lesson: protect the soul of the game, respect the community, and don’t let greed steer the ship. If Hytale succeeds, it won’t just be because it’s a good game—it’ll be because of that philosophy. submitted by /u/No-Doughnut9305 to r/hytale [link] [comments]",

      "content": "(Art by TheEyeArtist, but art aside depending on the genre, gameplay and what Studio and Writers would be working on it it could be M rated for all we know. And it's on current-gen consoles and steam.) Ahem. Anyways. After watching The Glorious Peak Show known as TADC. I suddenly remembered my old posts about What AAA Studio should Work on A Murder Drones Game on The MD Subs. And that combined with how expansive TADC is. I thought why not make A Sequel Post but for A Different Show However unlike MD I feel like A TADC Game Regardless if it's made by A Indie Studio, AAA Studio, etc. It still has alot of potential. But for now I wanna see The Execution on How An AAA/AA Studio would make A TADC Game. Maybe later on in the future I could make another post but for Indie Studios instead. I do plan on doing that And to be honest, considering how expansive TADC is. I feel like it could explore multiple genres of Games due to how the circus has different places to explore. Whether the game takes place in one single adventure or multiple adventures + the circus itself. But for me Personally I would LOVE Telltale if they were still here to this day to make A Choice-Based Game like The Walking Dead based on TADC. submitted by /u/hunter47685 to r/theamazingdigitalciru [link] [comments]",

I started using them because I needed to manage a lot of different profiles without everything getting mixed up. At first, it felt pretty good, separate profiles, clean setups, everything organized. Over time, I tried a few options and also spent some time using Incogniton. I liked being able to manage many profiles in one place, especially for social media and e-commerce accounts. It made things way easier to handle. After a while, I started noticing small things. Nothing really disappears. Even with separate profiles, small patterns still show up over time. That’s when it hit me, the browser isn’t doing most of the work. A lot of tracking comes from what you do over and over: same logins, same actions, same timing. submitted by /u/jpisafreakingbeast to r/hacking [link] [comments]",

The slider then builds it's own visuals by letting the correct number of golden panels appear according to the fill amount. Another component i use very frequently in the game i'm currently working on, plays a plop-up animation on UI elements every time they are enabled.

To win was to make the creature the kid thought about, but it was hard to do so when I played it since every combination of ingredients made a creature that usually got bullied by the sister.

I only care that I can legit get my save into the Pokemon home thing so I can collect all the Pokemon I played emerald on an emulator, and I liked it So I bought a used switch and am enjoying diamond and I am 99% sure I will like arceus So I wanna make sure I’m understanding basically what id need to do, given the legacy stuff is so old Gen 1-3=-gameboy or DS with the game boy slot Gen 4-7 = 3ds 8+ = switch But it seems there’s event stuff from the past that I can’t get the Pokemon from. So are there any/many of gen 1-3 that are not in 4-7. - unsure, but I’m least interested in these as they’re old asf and seemingly poor QOL And are there any in 4-7 that can’t be gotten on switch - pretty sure there are ones I’d miss cause there’s lots of games in this era. But not sure how many. The DS was huuuge when I was a kid. And I missed out so. Wanna see what there is to see. I know I can trade and such. But, idk if I’m looking at 20-30 trades or like 100-150 that can’t be gotten at all thru the switch I also have Pokemon go.

      "content": "Hey guys, new indie dev here. I'm making a cozy-looking strategy game called Carol and the Bells , but underneath the cute art, it's actually a gambling + deck building game inspired by Mr. Magpie’s Harmless Card Game . You get some hints of where the enemies are, and decide if you want to keep explore and get more coins or go to next level. In this clip, your deck is actually populating the 5x5 board you're flipping. I have some concerns: Does the game actually show that your cards are building the board, or does it just look like random? Does the \"Bell\" (cash-out) mechanic make it seem too easy/too hard, or does it feel like a meaningful risk/reward choice? Does the \"cute\" art style clash too much with the gambling risk? Or is that contrast appealing? Appreciate any feedback! submitted by /u/flavedogame to r/IndieDev [link] [comments]",

Right now im attempting to code a kind of board game, so drawing pieces, placing pieces, how they move on the board and in your hand and all inbetween. It would probably be smart to plan out before i get too deep in the code, so i can avoid spaghetti and sitting idly.

      "content": "Btw I think most people know this but still let me put some information here for those who doesn't know about DLS and having CR7's siu celebration in-game. So since the old DLS versions (iirc) CR7's siu celebration was part of the game till DLS23 and almost every player would do that celebration that too very frequently but since the release of DLS23 they kind of nerfed or something and most times no players were doing the siu including CR7 too. But siu wasn't removed entirely tho. Because I myself saw my players or Bot players or Opponent's players doing siu but VERY VERY rarely in DLS23, 24 and 25. And it continued like that as for the time being and even now. I think siu was never removed but Devs intentionally or unintentionally nerfed the celebration to very odd so we don't get to see it more often. But those who've played the 20, 21, 22 versions know that players used to literally spam the celebration back then after scoring and that was so frequent. One other thing is that I noticed sometimes players doing the siu celebration after winning career games final game be it the all star game or the final of global challenge cup or anything, in the end when all player and managers do the run off celebration and one player hits the siu. I noticed this in DLS25 too but haven't seen it in DLS26 as far as now. But it looks like siu is still in the game guys for the time being. submitted by /u/Cholic_Gerardo to r/DreamLeagueSoccer [link] [comments]",

You have developed the most pathetic excuse for a Star Wars game we’ve seen since BF2 at launch. It is unfathomable to me that you somehow destroyed your game so thoroughly that we are all losing conquest energy on battles that just… don’t… start. How in the world does that get past testing? Do you do any testing at all? At all??? I’m a few battles in and it’s already happened to me twice. Refunds. Now. But this keeps happening, your game just doesn’t work and you refund us over and over with a bunch of stuff. That’s cool and all, but why isn’t your game just working in the first place? Just pathetic, incompetent shit that would make a game design team in college scoff.

How can you play a game that is fully rigged and scripted? I don't understand. What do you find appealing at this shitty ass gameplay? It is sickening how every match is scripted. Your skill, your controls, your players, your OVR, your stats whatever, all of it DON'T MATTER because it's all fking scripted and it's horrible. The most important aspect of any game is being able to fucking play it, but in this \"game\" the only one that's being played is YOU. I really wanted to play this game but it's fucking disgusting, I cannot believe this exists and is popular. Humanity has gone to shit if we can't even recognize a good game from a bad one.

In strategy games, you spend half your life in menus, so I refused to let this just be a boring static spreadsheet. I spent the last week polishing the UX to make it feel as crisp and responsive as the combat itself. What’s under the hood: Seamless Drag & Drop: for unit placement. Smart Category Filters: to sort huge rosters instantly. Dynamic Layouts: Move and resize blocks to shape your formation exactly how you want. It’s been a challenge getting the \"game feel\" right in a UI, but I’m really happy with the flow. Let me know what you think! submitted by /u/Cifurr55 [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Hi guys - first project with Godot here and I'll keep it short. I am making a small Grand Strategy game and trying to add markers onto my map such I can have units / places visible. Here is the necessary context: Important Setup Visuals The crux of my issue is that I can't interact with my MapMarkers' MarkerCollisionShape , despite it being visible on the map. If I move the MapMarkers node outside of the SubViewport they become clickable, but in the wrong location. If I keep them in the SubViewport then they are in the perfect location but not clickable. Here is a demonstration of that: https://preview.redd.it/6k2ktzsodmeg1.png?width=812&format=png&auto=webp&s=5fcbf83461d0c010da18438ee9ce15a12cfbbfda It would be amazing to keep them within the SubViewport such that I don't have to recalculate the centroids for my all of my regions. My only understanding is that this is likely due to coordinates outside of the Subviewport being 3D while 2D inside - but I have fried my synapses trying to figure out a solution. Right now my player input is handled by the following script attached to the Player (Node3D): extends Node3D signal region_selected #Nodes var camera: Camera3D = $CameraSocket/Camera3D var camera_socket: Node3D = $CameraSocket func _ready() -> void: pass func _unhandled_input(event: InputEvent) -> void: if event is InputEventMouseButton and event.button_index == MOUSE_BUTTON_LEFT and event.pressed: shoot_ray() func shoot_ray(): var mouse_pos = get_viewport().get_mouse_position() print(mouse_pos) var ray_length = 2000 var from = camera.project_ray_origin(mouse_pos) var to = from + camera.project_ray_normal(mouse_pos) * ray_length var space = get_world_3d().direct_space_state var ray_query = PhysicsRayQueryParameters3D.new() ray_query.from = from ray_query.to = to var raycast_result = space.intersect_ray(ray_query) if !raycast_result.is_empty(): region_selected.emit(Vector2(raycast_result.position.x,raycast_result.position.z)) Thank you so much for anyone whose time is lent! I am at a bit of a roadblock with this one. submitted by /u/radenfar [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Recently I have been having massive issues with sleep and my overall well-being. I can’t sleep for more than two hours at a time and I’ve been having vivid, awful dreams every single night. I wake up sweating and scared and exhausted. I’m always tired. Always. Falling asleep in class, in the car, during meals…it’s bad. This has caused me to move my “bedtime” from 11pm to now 9pm or earlier some days. I have band and other extracurriculars every day after school, some days I don’t get home until 9pm. Of course I also have to do homework when I get home and sometimes even practice my instrument more because I’m in so many different ensembles (roughly 7 different bands with different music). And of course there’s getting ready for bed, getting ready for the next day, and eating dinner. With all of this, I barely have time to do more than one thing of my choosing at home. I used to do so much, whether that be video games, sewing, working on crafts, making videos, playing with my dogs, and more But not with my schedule, I have to *choose* between relaxing or doing something I enjoy. I hate this. I want time to relax in bed, take a bath, play some games, but I also want to be able to know I have time and energy to do all my crafts and playing with my dogs and even just cleaning my room. Not only this, but I believe my new ADHD medication has made me start to feel extremely icky and useless when I’m not doing something. So not only do I hate not being able to do all this, but when I am relaxing and just lying in bed hanging out, my mind and chest are all icky and I feel so…stupid and useless. I just want the time and energy to hang out *and* do things I love. submitted by /u/Peanut_Femboi to r/Vent [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Alright here's a game, pick a random episode of Simpsons, then a random episode of Family Guy, then tell me how these two have anything in common besides featuring a lower middle class American household Homer is a stupid fat drunk who's sometimes an asshole Peter is an alcoholic manchild with very little intelligence, but he makes up for it by being genuine and unabashed at being himself- which of course a lot of the times is an destructive asshole who's a danger to him and everyone around him-- but the core part of Peter's character in the first 9 seasons is that his immaturity and impulsiveness is where all the conflict and humor comes from. Now tell me, how's that even remotely similar to Homer? It isn't All of this falls apart when looking at the rest of the families: Bart, Lisa, Marge, etc, none of these characters are like anybody from Family Guy And the funniest part is these shallow comparisons are usually where it ends, because once you compare pacing, tonal and writing styles of these two shows, they diverge even further. Family Guy is optimized for laughs per minute and edgy shock value-- in other words, the absurdity and randomness is the appeal. Simpsons is honestly a Proto-Adult Cartoon these days; it feels more like a sitcom that just happened to be animated rather than live action. And yes, Family Guy's Golden Age (Season 3 - Season 8) beats all of the Simpsons any day. There's a reason why South Park and Simpsons basically teamed up to try and defame Family Guy during its prime. They were simply jealous that Seth MacFarlane had found a new formula that worked and was \"low-brow\" compared to what came before. Not realizing that all animated sitcoms are low brow and not exactly peak comedy lmao submitted by /u/RedditSucksMyBallls to r/CharacterRant [link] [comments]",

      "content": "I made a post recently about my teammates wanting me to switch off Tracer. This post is a follow-up to that but also, it's own thing. I would like constructive criticism on my match and performance please. I have come back from a 5 year hiatus on the game. I used to be gold-plat on my old account for context. I am aware that Bronze players now are better than the Bronze players back then so I am not too ashamed of being in Bronze. I just want to climb out. Replay code: DC1TVF Battletag / in-game username: likejava Hero(es) played: Tracer/Phara Skill tier / rank: Bronze Map: Route 66 PC or console: PC Note: I had switched to Pharah mid match because my teammates had requested, I get off of tracer. They asked me to get off of her right as the first match ended. I switched to Pharah because 1) She is very familiar to play and 2) Their reaper, torb, and brig started to become annoying and 3) My teammates requested that I switch. While I know that torb counters Pharah, I decided that I could play around it. I have no idea why they switched to Mei after that. Note 2: After practicing and reading on this sub to try to become a better Tracer, I realized that my sensitivity was WAY too high (17) so I bumped it down to 6.5. I haven't gotten used to doing 180s at this sens so please bear with me. It's especially apparent when the Torb kills me in the tunnel. submitted by /u/NoTransportation8027 to r/OverwatchUniversity [link] [comments]",

It’s the mental mistakes that are costing us games. Missed layups, we practice layups at game speed constantly at practice. Turnovers, bad passing, high risk passes that lead to nothing. Fouling 80 feet away from the basket when the other team is in the bonus. Not knowing who they’re are guarding when playing man to man. I just feel defeated. We go over our plays, when they run it we get open looks. We talk about the importance of taking care of the ball, getting back in transition. Making our layups and not fouling. Just venting.

Pretty amazing what you can do in Xfce once you learn CSS. The window frame colors are inspired from the Windows XP Royale theme. submitted by /u/jmoney777 to r/xfce [link] [comments]",
