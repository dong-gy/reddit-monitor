      "content": "downloaded Realish Weapons (I think) from steam workshop and it severely fucks. I cannot stress enough how cool it is to make polearms feel really good in this game, and still use a Longsword as an all-rounder. while it severely needs swords (needed) it also changes how Armors work, and makes open faced helmets count as nothing when you hit them in the face, so you can fight armored opponents with a Longsword much more realistically. check their Armor, and use combos that target areas good for you hits. do this on hard-core and have a really good hard-core time where your knowledge of the game won't trivialize the combat before you even get to the wedding. I've never modded kcd2 and also never used workshop mods before, but its really easy, and fucks hard. submitted by /u/GillianCorbit to r/kingdomcome [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Little Potion Garden is something I’ve wanted to make for a long time, so I finally sat down and built it myself. It’s a cozy, browser based lite MMO where you can brew potions, grow ingredients, and team up with other players to take down big, ridiculous bosses. No downloads, no grind, no pressure. Just open your browser and play. I’m a dad from Sydney who’s been building games and systems for years, and this one is fully self funded and made in the scraps of time that exist around parenting and life. My 11-year-old daughter is creating the artwork for the game as she learns digital art, and I’m handling the code, design, and everything under the hood. Some visuals are still placeholders while she works through each asset, but every final piece of art you see in the game is hers. I built Little Potion Garden because I love MMOs, but I don’t have the time to live inside one anymore. I wanted something lightweight, social, and genuinely fun to jump into whenever I get a moment. A game that feels welcoming instead of overwhelming. A world that grows over time, not one that demands your entire schedule. If you’re into cozy games, browser MMOs, or just want a place to relax and brew something magical, I think you’ll enjoy what we’re building here. The game updates every week, the art keeps improving as my daughter adds more of her work, and the world is slowly becoming exactly what we imagined. Thanks for giving a small, family-built project a chance. submitted by /u/Affectionate_Pilot99 to r/MMORPG [link] [comments]",

      "content": "My(31F) partner(44M) is very close with his daughter(19F). I long ago suspected emotional incest but he assured me he never confides in her or looks to her for mood stability. However, I strongly believe she feels like it is a responsibility of hers. She feels like it is her job to make her dad happy, and she constantly asks for alone time/trips. She follows him around the house like a puppy dog (even into the bathroom) where he has to stare at her like, are you gonna leave? She cannot function without him. She describes her body to him, asks inappropriate questions about his genitals. She’ll even lay on the floor right in front of him and shake her butt. He says he doesn’t establish boundaries bc it’s a free for all at their mamas. Basically, he doesn’t want to be a prude bc their mom is so open. He wants to be the fun parent…to the point that both of his kids have zero responsibility in our home and literally get whatever they ask for. It’s their way or the highway. Anyway, I just feel like the signs are there for both of them. There’s an immense codependency. She just went back to college after a month long break and he’s been anxious and moody since she left. He’s been snappy at me and distant. She calls every hour of the day, when she visits from college she can’t be away from him. She can’t even stay the night at her mom’s house and when her mom invites her to dinner, she invites my partner to go too! And she loves her mom. Has the greatest relationship with her, but cannot be away from dad. Idk what to do or if I’m seeing things incorrectly. submitted by /u/Silly_Assistance_558 to r/Codependency [link] [comments]",

If someone is going to make fun of you for this interest based on the reputation of chronically online losers, then they’re assholes and you should ignore them. Enjoy the things you like.

      "content": "I’ve only managed to play halfway through the second game, and I simply lack the patience to continue. The game’s controls are undoubtedly the worst I’ve ever encountered. They’re incredibly delayed and unresponsive at times, which is incredibly frustrating. For instance, when I press the jump and grab button to climb an obstacle, the character doesn’t grab on, so it takes me about a minute to climb onto something. Additionally, during chase scenes, I often have to run and jump over a ledge and onto the other side. However, the character doesn’t jump far enough sometimes, and I end up plummeting to my death. So, I have to re-do the chase scene multiple times until the character finally decides to jump far enough and make it across. The depth perception of the game is also quite confusing. When I walk on narrow pathways, I always end up walking and falling off the side because I can’t tell how close I am to the edge. There are also a few chase scenes where I have to slide into a vent hole to escape, but of course, I slide into the wall, missing the vent hole, and the monster catches me. The co-op mechanic in the second game is also annoying. Your teammate doesn’t help you out when you’re lost and don’t know what to do next. They only assist you when there’s something for them to do, like a jump assist or pushing something heavy. I also noticed that the third game of the series has the same co-op mechanic bs. Apparently, if your teammate dies but you don’t, you still have to restart from the last checkpoint, regardless. So, yeah, screw that. It’s even worse if anything. I’ve played similar games like Playdead’s Inside and Limbo, and they were nothing like this. Those games were actually enjoyable, and I still replay them to this day.

      "content": "In this world superpowers can take many shapes and forms, sometimes they are overwhelmingly useful, other times they are not. However what is consistent are a few major factors: Superpowers adapt the body so they can be adequately used, whether or not it’s used effectively is a different story. Usually superpowers fit along one side of the spectrum of powers, there are deviations but those are mutations and very rare. Superpowers fit within these classes: Physical, Mental, Psychic, Energy projection, or Special. Special usually means that the power is highly specialized and doesn’t really fit within these others After deciphering what power type so someone has, it then becomes a game of figuring out how strong it is. If say someone had super strength it’d go like this: Strong enough to punch through brick without really hurting anything Strong enough to lift up and even potentially throw a small vehicle Strong enough to act as a load bearing pillar on a large building. Strong enough to essentially output as much damage as a small nuke in one punch! Anything stronger than 4. After which they are judged on utility where 5 means it can be used in just about any situation, and 1 being ”it might be better to just not use it.” And finally the power averages for this verse are: Class 1: 9% Class 2: 21% Class 3: 46% Class 4: 23% Class 5: 1% submitted by /u/soup100 to r/PowerScaling [link] [comments]",

      "content": "As many of you have probably experienced in vanilla-ish Create packs, Diorite tends to be a bottleneck due to its dependence on mechanical crafters (which in of itself is quite time-consuming). This has led me to exploring the possibility of using vanilla minecraft Crafters which can be triggered per redstone tick (2 game ticks). The easiest way to perform complex recipes in a vanilla Crafter is to check for overflow on its inputs, only ticking the Crafter whenever there is a surplus of the ingredients, thus keeping the recipe in the Crafter (hence the comparator on depots). The vanilla method of doing this is quite complex for me (and limited by hoppers transfer speed) and so I sat down and tried to figure out a design that incorporates the aforementioned concept. The input is unified with a single Frogport for easy stocking (just slap a gauge on that bad boy for each of your required ingredient) and add filtered funnels for it on the sides of the Crafter. This lets us handle recipes that consist of 1-2 ingredients (e.g. Diorite, Electron Tubes, Propellers, Brass Hands). First set a recipe inside the Crafter and then provide a surplus of both ingredients. If there are items in both side depots, the sticky piston will activate an observer clock which ticks the Crafter pushing the crafted recipe down the barrel and down a chute for storage (a buffer barrel is required so that the chute won't pull ingredients from the Crafter). This can be done very early in survival, with a minimum requirement of making it to having Brass ingots and electron tubes to make the brass funnels, quartz for the observers and comparators. The Frogport handling is entirely optional. Provided an infinite supply of cobble and quartz this can produce 1 diorite per tick, or 20 diorite per second (72k per hour). submitted by /u/Nm3sis to r/CreateMod [link] [comments]",

Its sad to see a game with an unlimited ceiling of potential be killed off by its own incompetent team.

My indie horror game Late Lines FM has passed 1,000 wishlists on Steam.

I've done a few hours of research, and it seems that the most common methods for doing source control for game maker are not to use the internal source method, but rather, use Git + GitHub Desktop, or just GitHub Desktop itself. What do you guys think? Also, just a side question, you need ti manually commit a change to the repository, right? GHD will store the changes locally, but in order to cloud save them, you commit manually right? Anyways, what do you guys think! submitted by /u/Hot_head444 to r/gamemaker [link] [comments]",

      "content": "This may seem like an experimental and even a bit provocative post on the subreddit, and the question itself is unusual, I barely dared to write this post. I understand if the question itself seems unpleasant and unusual, but a long time ago I was thinking about why I have been so attached to this game for almost 20 years, even though I don't really like its story or its world very much (sometimes I make fun of it). So yes, I may be strange, but I'm still constantly interested. I follow the game, and apparently, I'm not that interested (not disparagingly) in its entire story, I've never been interested in the medieval theme, but if it was mixed with fantasy elements, then I wasn't interested even more. It never inspired me, but it was always there when I was in a bad mood, I always took it out when I wanted a still life, I just stared at the corridor for hours at Lord Bafford's estate and together with the ambient sounds, I was almost sucked into the game world, and here's the thing, its world gripped me amazingly. It's like a typical marriage, sometimes we fight, but we love each other, and I stick to the other, even if we have disagreements, this game is a bit like that for me. I have two feelings, contradictory to each other, but I still stick to it. It will always be there for me as long as I live. I'm curious about who, why and how is a fan of the game Thief? Do you know everything about it? Do you know its story, the characters? What makes someone a fan? Or maybe you just feel a strong attachment to the game that you don't even understand? I consider myself, for example, I don't call myself a fan, but rather a follower, I who am simply attached to the game, for a few characteristics that had a very, very big impact on me and still have to this day. For this reason, I call it one of the most defining games of all time. I think this is an interesting discovery, through research within ourselves, through deep analysis..., or am I just very lost? And can only a fan be someone who knows the game inside out? I'm curious about your experiences and insights! Feel free to debate my statement. But I felt it was important to mention this once. submitted by /u/relicproject_001 to r/Thief [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Hier der volle Python-Code mit Physik, Motor-Design und Prototyp-Bauplan: Was zum Teufel ist das? · DBD = Dielectric Barrier Discharge – Hochspannungs-Plasma erzeugt Ionenwind (direkter Schub, keine beweglichen Teile). · BLC = Brushless DC Motor – herkömmlicher bürstenloser Motor. · Kombiniert = Elektromagnetische Rotation + elektroaerodynamischer Plasma-Schub in einem Gehäuse. Warum ist das geil? · +30–50% mehr Schub bei gleichem Motorgewicht. · Plasma kühlt die Wicklungen aktiv. · Reduziert Geräusch um 10–20 dB (kein Lager-/Bürstenrasseln). · Redundanz: Wenn der EM-Antrieb ausfällt, treibt Plasma noch an (und umgekehrt). Prototyp für unter 200€: BLC-Motor 2212 (20€) Al₂O₃-Keramikplatten (0,5 mm, 20€) Flyback-Wandler für 5 kV (30€) Arduino Due + Steuerung (50€) Zusammenbau in einem Wochenende möglich. Erwartete Leistung (2212-Motor): · Nur BLC: 800 g Schub bei 12 A. · Nur DBD: 200 g Schub bei 20 W, 5 kV. · Hybrid: 950 g Schub (+19%) bei 13 A, Wirkungsgrad von 65% auf 70%. Anwendungen: · Drohnen: Mehr Schub, leisere Flüge. · Lüfter/Kühler: Keine beweglichen Teile im Luftstrom, selbstreinigend durch Plasma. · Raumfahrt: Elektrischer Antrieb ohne Treibstoff (nur Strom). · Medizinpumpen: Berührungslos und steril. Die Physik dahinter (vereinfacht): Schub_Plasma ≈ μ · (V/d)² · A · ρ μ = Ionenmobilität, V = Spannung, d = Elektrodenabstand, A = Fläche, ρ = Luftdichte Der Code berechnet alles: Schub, Wirkungsgrad, optimale Betriebspunkte, Leistungselektronik. Ist das Science-Fiction? Nein – alle Komponenten sind verfügbar, die Physik ist bekannt. Ein Proof-of-Concept-Prototyp könnte in einem Maker-Lab entstehen. Was denkt ihr? · Übersehe ich etwas Offensichtliches? · Gibt es schon ähnliche Projekte? · Wer baut den ersten Prototyp? TL;DR: DBD-Plasma + BLC-Motor = Hybridantrieb mit mehr Schub, weniger Lärm und aktiver Kühlung. Prototyp für 200€ baubar. Möglicher Game-Changer für Drohnen und Lüftersysteme. Für die Nerds: Der Code enthält vollständige Physik-Simulation, Motor-Design, Leistungselektronik und Visualisierung. submitted by /u/Loud_Noise1959 to u/Loud_Noise1959 [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Last week I started posting my game on like 7 different platforms — YouTube, X, Instagram, Tumblr, Bilibili, Rednote, and Douyin (the last three are apps from the country I live in). After about a week, I’ve got less than 50 followers total, which made me seriously rethink how I’m presenting the game. I usually describe it as a dark, horror-vibe RPG. But honestly, that label doesn’t seem to help much. When I tag it as “horror,” people seem to expect strong scares or jump-scare moments. When I tag it as “RPG,” it gets compared to games that are way more system-heavy than mine. The thing is, my game does have horror elements and RPG mechanics. It’s not that they’re missing. But once it’s put under those labels, it kind of just sinks into the massive pile of horror and RPG games out there. What I actually care most about — the art style, the atmosphere, the world-building — doesn’t really come through in promotion when I rely on those genres. I’m curious if anyone here has dealt with something similar, or followed games in this kind of in-between space.

      "content": "My landlord installed an appliance dishwasher in the apartment like it's a major upgrade, but I've hand washed dishes for years without issue. The machine uses more water and energy than I would, requires special detergent, and doesn't actually clean better than soapy sponge and effort. The convenience is negated by the resources wasted and space consumed. He'd ordered a mid-range model after researching energy ratings and cleaning performance. Found comparable machines through home appliance suppliers on Alibaba at lower prices but worried about warranty support. The dishwasher makes him feel like he's providing modern amenities even though it's solving a problem that didn't exist. We've decided that automation is inherently better than manual tasks even when manual is perfectly adequate. His dishwasher represents upgrading for the sake of upgrading, making apartments more appealing to renters who expect machines for everything. Maybe I'm wrong and dishwashers save time and water when used properly. But mine sits empty because loading and unloading takes longer than just washing would have. Sometimes the old way works fine and new technology is just more complicated rather than better. submitted by /u/FARHANFREESTYLER to r/kitchen [link] [comments]",

When I first joined the project, I was under the impression that I was a valued member of the modding community, and that my contributions would be properly appreciated. As it turns out, I was horribly mistaken. Making assets used by the mods doesn't seem to be considered \"real work\", or at least any contribution anywhere nearly as important as the coding portion. Even though I made every single one of the assets used in both skin packs, I have been declared a lesser contributor than even the coder that made half the code for the first mod. Asset artists aren't even allowed to post any mods in the channel for mod releases. The coder role is called \"Modder\", and only they are allowed to post mods in their name. We are, essentially, assistants to them within the server structure. Also, scamming is just also generally condoned. One of the two mods that I was promised in exchange for my artistic service have been abandoned (I had to accept the skin mod itself as half of the payment for, yknow, doing art for the skin mod), and I am left with almost nothing to show for days of work and sleepless nights spent poring over pages of skins-components. I was called \"just an artist\" by my commissioner, the very one who cited coding half of the mod as justification for them being the largest contributor to the project. I even let them do a different, easier mod for my work instead, and that too was abandoned. I'm not saying don't make art for the server, or make trades for services, or anything like that. Just, yknow, understand what you're getting into, and don't be surprised when you're treated as a second-class creator. submitted by /u/Pyrephecy to r/BadNorth [link] [comments]",

      "content": "It has been a while, but i finally had some time to draw more Phasmo ghosts! This is a small project in which i'm drawing every ghost's \"true\" form based on folklore, the game and my own ideas. Basically, if each ghost had their own special model, this is what i'd imagine they'd look like. (I know special models defeats the purpose of the game, i'm just doing this for fun!) Anyway, I based the Myling off folklore (generally a vengeful child who needs to be buried in order to truly rest) and its behavior in the game (quiet footsteps, oddly noisy in parabolic). It's basically a child holding the appearance of an undead young adolescent, and it is covered in feathers (that is why it's so quiet). It wears a mask because its face is decomposed, and you cannot really persuade people to bury you effectively when you look scary as hell. Then Poltergeist: I went through like three iterations of this thing lol (see the last images). I eventually settled on this, mostly based on how it behaves in the game. He throws shit. A lot. That's why he's got big hands. The eyes were inspired by pro wrestling masks. If any ghost would be a wrestler it's the Poltergeist right? As for the rest... i wanted to make it look like a fun strong, slightly non scary dude.

      "title": "When did things change for Nebraska Basketball under Fred Hoiberg?",
      "content": "This historic run for Nebraska has me feeling nostalgic and looking back to the dark days… The last three seasons of this program have been night and day compared to the early years of Fred Hoiberg’s tenure. The program is 62-25 (.713) since the start of the 2023-24 season. It’s an incredible turnaround after going 40-83 (.325) from 2019-23. We were an utter dormat and finished dead last in the Big Ten for the first three years. We probably wouldn’t have done any better in lesser conferences either (we lost to A LOT of mid-major schools at home). Hoiberg’s early struggles weren’t any indictment of him as a head coach. He walked into a really bad situation from a roster standpoint. In fact, Nebraska only had ONE returning player from Tim Miles’ final team ahead of Hoiberg’s first season. That was Thorir Thorbjarnarson, who only played in 9 games the year prior. Hoiberg never had a consistent roster and had to largely rely on grad transfers from mid-major schools until he could get a good core together. He practically had a completely different team each year and felt like we were just trying to keep our heads above water during those days. When did this program begin its historic turnaround? You could point to several of moments, but I started to feel a shift in momentum at the end of the 2021-22 season. Although they only won 10 games, the Huskers closed out the regular season with back-to-back wins over No. 23 Ohio State and No. 10 Wisconsin (both on the road). That win over Wisconsin felt very special and was the first sign of the program changing. Alonzo Verge’s dagger 3-pointer to take the late lead still gives me goosebumps: https://youtu.be/NyefZ7OH3OA?si=GGih1zoGAjtN82EE A winning culture was established from there on out… Nebraska would improve to 16-16 the following year, which included a win at No. 7 Creighton (first win in Omaha since 2004 in NIT, and 1995 if you only count the regular season). It’s funny to think about it now, but getting to .500 was a huge accomplishment after the first 3 years. Nebraska has been rolling ever since… making its first NCAA Tournament appearance since 2014, winning the College Basketball Crown and now looks to soar to even greater heights with an undefeated record through mid-January. Right now, they’re not just a lock to make the NCAA Tournament, but is vying for a top seed and a regular season conference title (something this program hasn’t done since 1950!) Such an amazing feat for a program that has yet to even win an NCAA tournament game. Overall, this historic run had me looking back to when it all changed for Hoiberg’s teams. I believe you can point to those March 2022 wins over Ohio State and Wisconsin as the sparks that helped make this program a winner. End of rant.

I’ve implemented a broad phase + swept AABB algorithm which works great in most cases, but incorrectly resolves collisions on both axes when colliding on the seams between adjacent blocks. Isolating the collision resolution to one block “works”, with the issue of the ball phasing through other objects if they’re too close to the ball when a previous collision is resolved. I’ve also tried sweeping and resolving per axis, but was ultimately unable to produce the result I wanted.

The map is small but really nice and engaging to drive in. The livery editor (which is very flawed) lets me make stuff like this. This game has been a great way for me to relax after long days, and I'm sure it will only get better with time. Their move to monetize this game is wayyyyy too premature, but I haven't spent a dime on anything beyond my initial purchase and am having a good time.

      "content": "After weeks of confusion, discounts, and overthinking… I finally pulled the trigger 😤 Specs: Ryzen 7 7250 (up to 5.1 GHz) RTX 5060 Laptop GPU (8GB) 16GB DDR5 1TB Gen4 SSD 15.6” QHD (2560×1440) IPS, 165Hz, 100% sRGB 60Wh battery Lenovo LOQ Gen 10 (Luna Grey) Expected delivery soon and I’m already refreshing the order page like a madman 💀 This is my first proper gaming + productivity laptop. I have one big doubt though: Will the Ryzen 7 7250 bottleneck the RTX 5060? From what I understand: At 1440p (QHD), the load shifts more to the GPU, so CPU bottleneck should be minimal. Ryzen 7 7250 has strong single-core and multi-core performance, so esports titles should easily hit high FPS. In CPU-heavy games at 1080p ultra + high FPS, there might be a small CPU limit, but nothing severe. So I’m guessing: No real bottleneck for gaming No issue for coding / engineering work GPU will be the limiting factor in most modern AAA games anyway Would love to hear real-world experience from LOQ / Ryzen + RTX owners. What should I do FIRST when it arrives? Any must-do tweaks or things to avoid? Use cases: Gaming (Valorant, AAA titles) Coding / engineering work Long college hours + travel Any advice is appreciated 🙏 Benchmarks & temps coming once it arrives 🚀 submitted by /u/Designer-Tell-2588 to r/LaptopDealsIndia [link] [comments]",

I'll lead us off: I've been losing interest in FEH for a while now. I haven't liked the direction the game has been going for the last year or so, and all of the recent powercreep has really turned me off. At the same time, I don't want to just quit since I've been here since the very start, and AR still does interest me to a point. Still...if this hyperoffensive meta gets even worse, even that won't be enough to keep me around. Speaking of hyperoffensive metas...I really, really detest the ability to bypass warp blocking. Young Camilla still continues to be one of the worst designed units of the modern game, and the dev's obsession with giving built-in Pass to newer skills just offends me on a basic level. I'm actually hoping for some sort of skill that blocks Pass like how Salvage exists, but they're not going to do that because then they can't sell their hyperoffensive units of the month. :') submitted by /u/SolHiryu to r/FireEmblemHeroes [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Hey everyone! 👋 I recently released a small indie game called ”Get In Get Out” and it’s heavily inspired by That’s Not My Neighbor, Papers, Please, and other short, tense indie games of the same genre. It’s basically like Papers, Please, but post-apocalyptic: you’re running a checkpoint, making decisions under pressure, and trying to survive the consequences of who you let in… and who you don’t. I thought some people here might genuinely enjoy it. It’s a small passion project rather than some huge commercial release, but I wanted to share it with the exact kind of players who love this genre. Thanks for letting me post! 🙏 And if you do decide to check it out, I’d really appreciate a Steam review. It helps a ton and also lets me improve the game based on what players actually want 🙂 submitted by /u/GetInGetOutGame [link] [comments]",

I really want to get a tandem since it’s the newest gen, but I also really want an ultrawide and from what I’ve seen there aren’t any ultrawide tandem oleds out yet and even if there were it would definitely be out of my price range. I don’t actually have any idea how much better tandem is then 3rd gen so I’m wondering is it worth going for the tandem even if it’s not at the size I want or should I just get ultrawide. I play a lot of single player games(especially cyberpunk), but also some shooters like siege and fortnite. Not sure how much difference that makes on choosing which size to go for. The tandem I would be going with is the GIGABYTE MO27Q28G The ultrawide would be the LG 34GS95QE They would cost about same at around $900 cad.

I find it hard to come up with a bonus for the Hunter background for this character.

      "content": "After weeks of confusion, discounts, and overthinking… I finally pulled the trigger 😤 Specs: Ryzen 7 7250 (up to 5.1 GHz) RTX 5060 Laptop GPU (8GB) 16GB DDR5 1TB Gen4 SSD 15.6” QHD (2560×1440) IPS, 165Hz, 100% sRGB 60Wh battery Lenovo LOQ Gen 10 (Luna Grey) Expected delivery soon and I’m already refreshing the order page like a madman 💀 This is my first proper gaming + productivity laptop. I have one big doubt though: Will the Ryzen 7 250 bottleneck the RTX 5060? From what I understand: At 1440p (QHD), the load shifts more to the GPU, so CPU bottleneck should be minimal. Ryzen 7 250 has strong single-core and multi-core performance, so esports titles should easily hit high FPS. In CPU-heavy games at 1080p ultra + high FPS, there might be a small CPU limit, but nothing severe. So I’m guessing: No real bottleneck for gaming No issue for coding / engineering work GPU will be the limiting factor in most modern AAA games anyway Would love to hear real-world experience from LOQ / Ryzen + RTX owners. What should I do FIRST when it arrives? Any must-do tweaks or things to avoid? Use cases: Gaming (Valorant, AAA titles) Coding / engineering work Long college hours + travel Any advice is appreciated 🙏 Benchmarks & temps coming once it arrives 🚀 submitted by /u/Designer-Tell-2588 to r/LenovoLOQ [link] [comments]",

I fear that the devs might be going down a path where they believe floorhugging is best for the game but it's slowly killing their love project in the long run. Is there any way it could be removed, even with heavy tweaking to other mechanics ? Or is Rivals 2 doomed to have a shrinking community akin to a pro-floorhugging echo chamber ?

      "content": "Brazil’s minimum wage is around USD 250 to 300 per month, yet most handheld devices cost the equivalent of several months of income for the average person. The biggest issue is import taxes. Brazil has long had import taxation, but in recent years enforcement and overall tax burden have become much harsher. Depending on how customs evaluates the package, total taxes can now reach 90 to 100% of the product’s declared value, something that wasn’t nearly as common in the past. This makes buying anything from abroad stressful. You never know the final price, there’s always fear of extra fees, delays, or customs holds. Since most handhelds aren’t officially sold here, importing is often the only option, and it feels like a gamble every time. What’s especially frustrating is seeing handheld gaming treated as affordable and accessible in other countries, while here it becomes a luxury purchase or a financial risk. It’s not about wanting premium tech, it’s about how basic access to a hobby is restricted by low wages and aggressive taxation. submitted by /u/Original-Educator-38 to r/SBCGaming [link] [comments]",

      "content": "How would chest inventories be separated? Say I have an actor for chests with all the blueprints for adding, removing, and moving items within it. In a level I have 2 chests and I want them both to be that same chest actor. One chest has a sword the other chest has a shield. How would I initialize them with these different inventories? Do I have to make children actors to that first chest actor and then give them specific inventories with an inherited blueprint? My concern is that I would have to make an actor for every chest in the game with this method and perhaps that would be inefficient. Though some chests will have different models and enemies might spawn their corpse as a chest to be looted, so it would be necessary to some degree anyway.

After reading the galery card, I think it teases heavely on Black Cat (show up where least wanted) and Kingpin (who’s in charge of the city put it on lockdown). But the image of the card also teases White Fox. What I think about all of it: The devs know that the game needs more vanguards and strategists, so I would not be surprised if season 7 releases a character for each role (KP - Tank) (BC - DPS) (WF - Sup). Another theory: Miller Ross posted about a season having 2 strategists around season 5. He could be talking about season 7 with Black Cat and White Fox both being strategists. Also, they would break the pattern of having a male and female character per season, but I think that would be balanced out cause season 8 should be 2026 Hellfire Gala and it should introduce Cyclops and Colossus to the game. This post is just for fun. Just a few theories Ive got about the next few months of the game and would like to hear what yall think. submitted by /u/manofsteel130 to r/marvelrivals [link] [comments]",

The idea is to used my lived experience as a disabled artist to make a cozy fashion/shop sim. The player character is on medical leave from college and goes back to their home town after developing a chronic illness, and the people in their town come together to help them open up their own shop filled with handmade apparel. There's more game mechanic wise but I don't want this post to be too long. Anyway, while I've only ever coded HTML/CSS, I've always loved pixel art, even though I struggled with it. After making this, I really want to learn more about game deving so I can bring this little dream of mine into reality. I've watched a few lengthy YT videos on Godot, but I could use some help finding more in depth, accessible resources! submitted by /u/exopsyche [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Code:840JBR Platform:pc Rank:masters 4 Hero played:moira So this was the last game of the day and I felt empty because I feel like it was so winnable this flashpoint went all the way to 5 but I feel like we just threw the last point so hard. This game started off ok with a messy first fight and we had a weird comp but we pulled out in the end. Their tank went dva and it all went downhill as they 5 man dived our backline and was eating anything of value. I couldn’t keep our backline alive for the life of me as wuyang and echo kept getting rolled and their reaper was on the back 24/7 as well. I felt the next few fights until our tank swapped was just our backline getting rolled(or I just didn’t turn around) and me fading to the tank and praying we can pull off a 2v4,though ngl our tank was doing great and our dps were counterswapping their lives out so I don’t think the could’ve done more wuyang also swapped to a more survivable hero eventually as well so we were doing better. But then I feel like our tank swapping to dva literally started just dive bombing whoever they saw first which kind of worked kind of didn’t but it got us to the last point where I think our first mistake was not kiting kiri ult when we all litirally could’ve jus left. Then when we flipped point we were down two and the looked like they were going to recounted so our kiri ults point which I don’t think I can blame them as I couldn’t see how many people were on high but our dva litirally flies into their team making tons of space and pushing them back but also using ult in the process so we more or less wasted two ults and staggered out a solid 20%. Last fight reaper tps in I ult reaper to keep them alive probably should’ve faded(I can’t remember if I had it) but souj killed me mid ult and it was just over. I’m not sure where I could’ve done better as I switched to healing orbs when dva started eating all my orbs I was doing decent healing as I was 7k above everyone else at the end of the match they all had 12-13k my dmg was lacking a bit me and other support both had 1k less than theirs but I feel like with reaper giving constant backshots and souj clicking heads dmg and dva eating everything dmg value was hard to come by. I also never really ran out of heals so I was never desperate to dps. I thought about swapping to brig or Lucio to go all in like they did/counterswap dva but I feel like brigs so bad into a good reaper and I doubt we could’ve survived 5 man dive anyways. and I rarely play Lucio on my alt I mess around with him and I’m diamond 2(haven’t peaked yet) but I feel like I’m just trolling on him and winning. I’d like any advice on what to do and look for, have I peaked as a player who can only play casually and doesn’t bother ult tracking? Should I have swapped I’m not an otp by any means I just feel like survival was what was needed of me that game(I can brig, troll on Lucio, Ana, Juno, kiri, illari, and bap). Should I be more aware of my backline(I did get mildly flamed by echo for not looking at him but he swapped and I feel like we did a lot better I also don’t think an echo should expect that much from a lowly moira who only has limited piss range). Should I be looking to do more damage as some content creators preach?(I don’t believe in letting my team die unless I also trade but then we’re literally even so there was no point really unless we trade tank imo).

To lower the barrier, I released it on itch.io so it could be played directly in the browser instead of requiring a download. I thought that would make things easier for players. I made a post announcing the demo launch… and it got little to no engagement. That was a bit of a reality check.

      "content": "Really enjoyed the game, the ambiance was amazing and the game mechanics were very fun to play with. Now, with the cliffhanger at the end, I have no idea if the devs are going for a sequel or dlcs but still here's a few to suggestion to make the amazing into nearly perfect: -A weapon artes or ashes of war like mechanics. It seems to me like the skeleton for it is already there with each weapon category having a special ability, I think it would be interesting to have something a bit more unique for a few weapons. - A way to farm entropic essence even if it's a slow grind. I had already done most of the game, upgraded my lantern as much as I could and also my spells, and then I stumble on Huy, no way to finish his quest unless I keep him in mind for a new game plus. It would also enable a player to grind for it if they want to max out their spells. -More weapon types with unique move sets would also go a long way in my opinion.

Here is how it works: You can earn credits by testing indie games/apps (fun + you help other makers) You can use credits to get your own game tested by real people No fake accounts -> all testers are real users Test more games -> earn more credits -> your game will rank higher -> you get more visibility and more testers/users It's called IndieAppCircle and you can check it out here: https://www.indieappcircle.com/games For uploading your game, you really only need a link to it. You can add a description of the game and a logo so that people know what to expect. You should also add instructions on what people should test (can be very general as well). There are also other categories like web apps, android/iOS apps/games or chrome extensions allowed on the platform so there should be enough interesting stuff to test and earn credits!
