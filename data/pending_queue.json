      "title": "When did things change for Nebraska Basketball under Fred Hoiberg?",
      "content": "This historic run for Nebraska has me feeling nostalgic and looking back to the dark days… The last three seasons of this program have been night and day compared to the early years of Fred Hoiberg’s tenure. The program is 62-25 (.713) since the start of the 2023-24 season. It’s an incredible turnaround after going 40-83 (.325) from 2019-23. We were an utter dormat and finished dead last in the Big Ten for the first three years. We probably wouldn’t have done any better in lesser conferences either (we lost to A LOT of mid-major schools at home). Hoiberg’s early struggles weren’t any indictment of him as a head coach. He walked into a really bad situation from a roster standpoint. In fact, Nebraska only had ONE returning player from Tim Miles’ final team ahead of Hoiberg’s first season. That was Thorir Thorbjarnarson, who only played in 9 games the year prior. Hoiberg never had a consistent roster and had to largely rely on grad transfers from mid-major schools until he could get a good core together. He practically had a completely different team each year and felt like we were just trying to keep our heads above water during those days. When did this program begin its historic turnaround? You could point to several of moments, but I started to feel a shift in momentum at the end of the 2021-22 season. Although they only won 10 games, the Huskers closed out the regular season with back-to-back wins over No. 23 Ohio State and No. 10 Wisconsin (both on the road). That win over Wisconsin felt very special and was the first sign of the program changing. Alonzo Verge’s dagger 3-pointer to take the late lead still gives me goosebumps: https://youtu.be/NyefZ7OH3OA?si=GGih1zoGAjtN82EE A winning culture was established from there on out… Nebraska would improve to 16-16 the following year, which included a win at No. 7 Creighton (first win in Omaha since 2004 in NIT, and 1995 if you only count the regular season). It’s funny to think about it now, but getting to .500 was a huge accomplishment after the first 3 years. Nebraska has been rolling ever since… making its first NCAA Tournament appearance since 2014, winning the College Basketball Crown and now looks to soar to even greater heights with an undefeated record through mid-January. Right now, they’re not just a lock to make the NCAA Tournament, but is vying for a top seed and a regular season conference title (something this program hasn’t done since 1950!) Such an amazing feat for a program that has yet to even win an NCAA tournament game. Overall, this historic run had me looking back to when it all changed for Hoiberg’s teams. I believe you can point to those March 2022 wins over Ohio State and Wisconsin as the sparks that helped make this program a winner. End of rant.

      "content": "I have been making some progress with the 20 games challenge, but I’ve run into an issue with collision resolution in my 2nd game, a clone of breakout. I’ve implemented a broad phase + swept AABB algorithm which works great in most cases, but incorrectly resolves collisions on both axes when colliding on the seams between adjacent blocks. Isolating the collision resolution to one block “works”, with the issue of the ball phasing through other objects if they’re too close to the ball when a previous collision is resolved. I’ve also tried sweeping and resolving per axis, but was ultimately unable to produce the result I wanted. To those who have used swept AABB in a tile based game, how were you able to solve the issue of incorrect seam collisions? submitted by /u/Nearby-Pay-690 [link] [comments]",

Being able to upgrade your weapons with the ores you find in the caves turned out to be a great solution, and the gameplay loop feels much better now. Some of the more astute gamers out there might be aware of a small indie game called Minecraft that also does this.

I have one big doubt though: Will the Ryzen 7 7250 bottleneck the RTX 5060? From what I understand: At 1440p (QHD), the load shifts more to the GPU, so CPU bottleneck should be minimal. Ryzen 7 7250 has strong single-core and multi-core performance, so esports titles should easily hit high FPS. In CPU-heavy games at 1080p ultra + high FPS, there might be a small CPU limit, but nothing severe. So I’m guessing: No real bottleneck for gaming No issue for coding / engineering work GPU will be the limiting factor in most modern AAA games anyway Would love to hear real-world experience from LOQ / Ryzen + RTX owners. What should I do FIRST when it arrives? Any must-do tweaks or things to avoid?

I am hoping to find someone to consistently chat with but also respect that eachother may not always be buried in their phones. A little about me: I am a pretty diverse person. I like to workout and am hoping to find someone who would enjoy pushing each other to do better but not a requirement. I love to be active and play pickleball and have recently started to pick up golf but I’m terrible I’m not much of a chef but I do have a smoker and love to make my own bbq. Not much beats a Saturday with college football, some beer and firing up the smoker. I also have some introvert tendencies and will lock myself in the house. I enjoy playing video games, watching movies, scary movies , tv shows like GOT and the various Star Wars shows. I am interested in talking with people around the world as well, so time differences don’t matter to me as long as effort is put in submitted by /u/Hot-Log-1949 to r/InternetFriends [link] [comments]",

I'll lead us off: I've been losing interest in FEH for a while now. I haven't liked the direction the game has been going for the last year or so, and all of the recent powercreep has really turned me off. At the same time, I don't want to just quit since I've been here since the very start, and AR still does interest me to a point. Still...if this hyperoffensive meta gets even worse, even that won't be enough to keep me around. Speaking of hyperoffensive metas...I really, really detest the ability to bypass warp blocking. Young Camilla still continues to be one of the worst designed units of the modern game, and the dev's obsession with giving built-in Pass to newer skills just offends me on a basic level. I'm actually hoping for some sort of skill that blocks Pass like how Salvage exists, but they're not going to do that because then they can't sell their hyperoffensive units of the month. :') submitted by /u/SolHiryu to r/FireEmblemHeroes [link] [comments]",

I don’t actually have any idea how much better tandem is then 3rd gen so I’m wondering is it worth going for the tandem even if it’s not at the size I want or should I just get ultrawide. I play a lot of single player games(especially cyberpunk), but also some shooters like siege and fortnite. Not sure how much difference that makes on choosing which size to go for.

Most of the time it is ok, I can make a ruling on the go and after revision or a new situation where it applies, change it a little bit. i.e. I decided to give a +1 to thievery skills to a character with Thieves Guild background. But I've got a Hunter (Who knows how silently move in the wilds) which is also a Ranger (who has advantage on stealth). I find it hard to come up with a bonus for the Hunter background for this character. I was thinking in providing a stealth bonus to the whole group when accompanying the Ranger, or give a chance of surprise on the encounters in the wild. But I've got nothing definitive.

I have one big doubt though: Will the Ryzen 7 250 bottleneck the RTX 5060? From what I understand: At 1440p (QHD), the load shifts more to the GPU, so CPU bottleneck should be minimal. Ryzen 7 250 has strong single-core and multi-core performance, so esports titles should easily hit high FPS. In CPU-heavy games at 1080p ultra + high FPS, there might be a small CPU limit, but nothing severe. So I’m guessing: No real bottleneck for gaming No issue for coding / engineering work GPU will be the limiting factor in most modern AAA games anyway Would love to hear real-world experience from LOQ / Ryzen + RTX owners. What should I do FIRST when it arrives? Any must-do tweaks or things to avoid?

      "content": "Brazil’s minimum wage is around USD 250 to 300 per month, yet most handheld devices cost the equivalent of several months of income for the average person. The biggest issue is import taxes. Brazil has long had import taxation, but in recent years enforcement and overall tax burden have become much harsher. Depending on how customs evaluates the package, total taxes can now reach 90 to 100% of the product’s declared value, something that wasn’t nearly as common in the past. This makes buying anything from abroad stressful. You never know the final price, there’s always fear of extra fees, delays, or customs holds. Since most handhelds aren’t officially sold here, importing is often the only option, and it feels like a gamble every time. What’s especially frustrating is seeing handheld gaming treated as affordable and accessible in other countries, while here it becomes a luxury purchase or a financial risk. It’s not about wanting premium tech, it’s about how basic access to a hobby is restricted by low wages and aggressive taxation. submitted by /u/Original-Educator-38 to r/SBCGaming [link] [comments]",

Gameplay abilities don't seem to be executing because damage does not propagate via gameplay effects which leads to our gameplay cues not triggering either. I have no idea how this is possible. Anyone else run into this issue?? Any and all help would be greatly appreciated! submitted by /u/Johnny290 [link] [comments]",

      "content": "How would chest inventories be separated? Say I have an actor for chests with all the blueprints for adding, removing, and moving items within it. In a level I have 2 chests and I want them both to be that same chest actor. One chest has a sword the other chest has a shield. How would I initialize them with these different inventories? Do I have to make children actors to that first chest actor and then give them specific inventories with an inherited blueprint? My concern is that I would have to make an actor for every chest in the game with this method and perhaps that would be inefficient. Though some chests will have different models and enemies might spawn their corpse as a chest to be looted, so it would be necessary to some degree anyway.

After reading the galery card, I think it teases heavely on Black Cat (show up where least wanted) and Kingpin (who’s in charge of the city put it on lockdown). But the image of the card also teases White Fox. What I think about all of it: The devs know that the game needs more vanguards and strategists, so I would not be surprised if season 7 releases a character for each role (KP - Tank) (BC - DPS) (WF - Sup). Another theory: Miller Ross posted about a season having 2 strategists around season 5. He could be talking about season 7 with Black Cat and White Fox both being strategists. Also, they would break the pattern of having a male and female character per season, but I think that would be balanced out cause season 8 should be 2026 Hellfire Gala and it should introduce Cyclops and Colossus to the game.

The idea is to used my lived experience as a disabled artist to make a cozy fashion/shop sim. The player character is on medical leave from college and goes back to their home town after developing a chronic illness, and the people in their town come together to help them open up their own shop filled with handmade apparel. There's more game mechanic wise but I don't want this post to be too long. Anyway, while I've only ever coded HTML/CSS, I've always loved pixel art, even though I struggled with it. After making this, I really want to learn more about game deving so I can bring this little dream of mine into reality. I've watched a few lengthy YT videos on Godot, but I could use some help finding more in depth, accessible resources! submitted by /u/exopsyche [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Code:840JBR Platform:pc Rank:masters 4 Hero played:moira So this was the last game of the day and I felt empty because I feel like it was so winnable this flashpoint went all the way to 5 but I feel like we just threw the last point so hard. This game started off ok with a messy first fight and we had a weird comp but we pulled out in the end. Their tank went dva and it all went downhill as they 5 man dived our backline and was eating anything of value. I couldn’t keep our backline alive for the life of me as wuyang and echo kept getting rolled and their reaper was on the back 24/7 as well. I felt the next few fights until our tank swapped was just our backline getting rolled(or I just didn’t turn around) and me fading to the tank and praying we can pull off a 2v4,though ngl our tank was doing great and our dps were counterswapping their lives out so I don’t think the could’ve done more wuyang also swapped to a more survivable hero eventually as well so we were doing better. But then I feel like our tank swapping to dva literally started just dive bombing whoever they saw first which kind of worked kind of didn’t but it got us to the last point where I think our first mistake was not kiting kiri ult when we all litirally could’ve jus left. Then when we flipped point we were down two and the looked like they were going to recounted so our kiri ults point which I don’t think I can blame them as I couldn’t see how many people were on high but our dva litirally flies into their team making tons of space and pushing them back but also using ult in the process so we more or less wasted two ults and staggered out a solid 20%. Last fight reaper tps in I ult reaper to keep them alive probably should’ve faded(I can’t remember if I had it) but souj killed me mid ult and it was just over. I’m not sure where I could’ve done better as I switched to healing orbs when dva started eating all my orbs I was doing decent healing as I was 7k above everyone else at the end of the match they all had 12-13k my dmg was lacking a bit me and other support both had 1k less than theirs but I feel like with reaper giving constant backshots and souj clicking heads dmg and dva eating everything dmg value was hard to come by. I also never really ran out of heals so I was never desperate to dps. I thought about swapping to brig or Lucio to go all in like they did/counterswap dva but I feel like brigs so bad into a good reaper and I doubt we could’ve survived 5 man dive anyways. and I rarely play Lucio on my alt I mess around with him and I’m diamond 2(haven’t peaked yet) but I feel like I’m just trolling on him and winning. I’d like any advice on what to do and look for, have I peaked as a player who can only play casually and doesn’t bother ult tracking? Should I have swapped I’m not an otp by any means I just feel like survival was what was needed of me that game(I can brig, troll on Lucio, Ana, Juno, kiri, illari, and bap). Should I be more aware of my backline(I did get mildly flamed by echo for not looking at him but he swapped and I feel like we did a lot better I also don’t think an echo should expect that much from a lowly moira who only has limited piss range). Should I be looking to do more damage as some content creators preach?(I don’t believe in letting my team die unless I also trade but then we’re literally even so there was no point really unless we trade tank imo). Should I just quit work and grind ow? submitted by /u/Clean_Pound3389 to r/OverwatchUniversity [link] [comments]",

During development, I shared a few posts on this sub and got some decent engagement, feedback, comments, and discussions which honestly got me excited. When the demo was ready, I expected at least a handful of people to try it out, even just out of curiosity. To lower the barrier, I released it on itch.io so it could be played directly in the browser instead of requiring a download. I thought that would make things easier for players. I made a post announcing the demo launch… and it got little to no engagement. That was a bit of a reality check. Getting attention and feedback during development felt much easier than convincing people to actually click and play, even when the demo is free and accessible. I’m curious has anyone else experienced this gap between dev interest and player interest? What helped you convert “looks cool” into actual plays? submitted by /u/dev_dev_dev_ [link] [comments]",

Now, with the cliffhanger at the end, I have no idea if the devs are going for a sequel or dlcs but still here's a few to suggestion to make the amazing into nearly perfect: -A weapon artes or ashes of war like mechanics. It seems to me like the skeleton for it is already there with each weapon category having a special ability, I think it would be interesting to have something a bit more unique for a few weapons. - A way to farm entropic essence even if it's a slow grind. I had already done most of the game, upgraded my lantern as much as I could and also my spells, and then I stumble on Huy, no way to finish his quest unless I keep him in mind for a new game plus. It would also enable a player to grind for it if they want to max out their spells. -More weapon types with unique move sets would also go a long way in my opinion.

Here is how it works: You can earn credits by testing indie games/apps (fun + you help other makers) You can use credits to get your own game tested by real people No fake accounts -> all testers are real users Test more games -> earn more credits -> your game will rank higher -> you get more visibility and more testers/users It's called IndieAppCircle and you can check it out here: https://www.indieappcircle.com/games For uploading your game, you really only need a link to it. You can add a description of the game and a logo so that people know what to expect. You should also add instructions on what people should test (can be very general as well).

It doesn’t just focus on one character — it feels like it’s actively trying to break the original timeline for all the girls. The way it handles their routes makes it feel less like a normal mod and more like the game is aware something is wrong. Has anyone else played it?

Here is how it works: You can earn credits by testing indie games/apps (fun + you help other makers) You can use credits to get your own game tested by real people No fake accounts -> all testers are real users Test more games -> earn more credits -> your game will rank higher -> you get more visibility and more testers/users It's called IndieAppCircle and you can check it out here: https://www.indieappcircle.com/games For uploading your game, you really only need a link to it. You can add a description of the game and a logo so that people know what to expect. You should also add instructions on what people should test (can be very general as well). There are also other categories like web apps, android/iOS apps/games or chrome extensions allowed on the platform so there should be enough interesting stuff to test and earn credits! Feel free to leave any questions/feedback/feature suggestions in the comments! Thank you to everyone who joined so far! submitted by /u/luis_411 [link] [comments]",

      "content": "I'm talking about things that don't affect gameplay but you wouldn't do in FM because of some real life connection. The most classic example would be managing your team's rival, of course even if it was the most fun save that everyone was suggesting, you probably wouldn't manage Man Utd as a Man City fan. But that's the most obvious one (also signing Greenwood and other such scum). However I'm taking about less obvious stuff than these two examples. Also everything is connected to real life of course, Man City is good in game because they're good IRL but I'm talking mostly about things that don't affect gameplay (Greenwood is just code in-game and a decent player in the engine). I'll start with one (or two) examples that are a bit less obvious. Many people start lower league saves with non-historic clubs, maybe it's their local club, maybe they have the best badge, maybe they're the worst in the league etc. I however can't bring myself to manage one of the least-supported clubs in the league, even if I start in the lower leagues, I'm definitely picking the fallen giant with a big fan base for the level. This has gameplay implications of course with higher attendances and revenue but that's not my reason for doing it at all. I want to feel like I'm making lots of people happy and that I can feel part of the team by searching about them and finding some resources. I also can't pick a \"plastic\" club such as MK Dons, even ones with fans, because they've been turned into an RB club for example.

      "content": "The latest roblox release has ruined almost all creator games for MacOS players. This is because of a key feature in all these games known as \"multi select\" losing its ability to work. With the new release of roblox switching the input for Ctrl from the \"command\" key to the \"control\" key on MacOS devices, all systems that used to require the input of the command key, including multi-selecting objects in creator games no longer work. To reproduce this simply go into a game like \"Tower Creator\" or \"Obby Creator\" on a mac device and try selecting multiple objects while holding down the command/control key. What I found most peculiar is how roblox studio still uses command+c and command+click for cloning and multi-select respectively yet actual roblox games had their MacOS keybinds changed causing issues. Would really appreciate if this got decent traction cause it's causing me and a lot of other mac users alot of trouble trying to build things and if anyone reading this has dev forum posting access I would heavily appreciate awareness being brought to this issue. submitted by /u/Negative-Courage2889 to r/robloxgamedev [link] [comments]",

      "content": "So, I have been thinking more than a little about Freedom from WoF recently since I have been drawing her lately, and the concept is so out of place I love it (the concept, not the execution. A hive mind plant that's controlled by the souls of a dragonet and human that died long ago is quite out there, probably the weirdest thing I've read about. ). Turns out dragon stories can have that sort of things, though my opinion on them differs. I don't find the fact dragons arrive in meteors in the Dragonheart movie series to be that strange, perhaps because I was already found of the idea and planned to implement it in my stories. But I totally see why anyone would find that reveal weird. I also don't find the reveal \"X fantasy setting is earth in the future\" that strange either, but that has to do with the fact I imagine the author wanted to add in some grand twist. Basically I stop thinking about the in universe aspect and begin thinking about the meta/writing reasoning part, which is a personal thing. I guess the Legend of Spyro has its own weird stuff, but for the purple derg it is totally inspired from avatar, and for the rest I consider strange in it... Well, the whole golem thing, the Destroyer and making a new world (literally) is appealing enough, but i see it more as way for the devs to stupidly up the stakes. There is just not enough focus and foreshadowing to really flesh out the ideas in my opinion, especially since it ignores the lore of the previous games. submitted by /u/Ofynam to r/WyrmWorks [link] [comments]",

Not really anything positive can be taken from yesterday. Having had some time to think it over I still think he’ll he given the next two seasons to prove he’s the long term answer at QB for us. I’ve no doubt there’s the talent there but the decision making and mentality for me are under serious questioning. I know we’ve changed OC and we were down a few keys guys last night but to play that poorly is simply unacceptable. In terms of the future I struggle to see us doing anything other than keep Stroud on. No chance we trade for a big time QB simply due to the cap cost of someone like Burrow, Herbert etc (putting to one side how unlikely it would be to get them). In terms of moving Stroud on maybe a team like the Jets, Browns etc maybe give us a first for him but I find it unlikely I guess my confusion is how we went from him balling out rookie year to this season where he’s been poor quite often (yes had some great moments) but the last two games he’s looked like a deer in the headlights Got to hope he puts a power of work in during the offseason and between Caley and Ryans can get the message through to him that it’s now or never for his future at the Texans submitted by /u/Relevant-Goose5483 to r/Texans [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Just a PSA. We have a lot of questions in this sub from people looking to get started. They want advice on what to do, where to go, what engine to pick, what game to make, etc etc. One of the things that helps set game developers up for success, IMHO, is the ability to do your own research and help yourself. If you've done some research into your question, come here and tell us what research you have already done and what you have found. That makes it easier for us to help you. If you ask for help having done nothing yourself, it's difficult for people to help you. Or rather, why should they? A wealth of material exists to help answer those basic questions - consult those first before asking for help. If you want to succeed as a game developer, you need to master the skill of researching things yourself and finding solutions to new problems. You'll never build a game if you just post on reddit any time you get stuck. During the development of your game, you will encounter problems that no one else has ever seen, and its your job to solve them. You can ask for help and advice, sure, but if you don't learn to help yourself at least part of the time, you won't make it. I don't mean to sound harsh. But its the truth. Learn to help yourself. Develop those research skills - they are a lot more important than you think, and they apply to more than just games. submitted by /u/AngelOfLastResort [link] [comments]",

The issue is that multiple YouTubers reached out to me after me contacting them, saying thanks, but this isn't the kind of game I play on my channel. I have tried to look for people who cover similar games, but honestly, there isn't a market for videos like this on YouTube, I believe. If anyone has any advice on other ways to market this game or any channels you think could be appropriate, please let me know.

The base ordering/inventory/auction UI system is locked in. My ledger connects to my inventory manager and allows the player to place bids, order wholesale and view stocked inventory. I got a lot of work done on the NPC systems including spawning, taking books from shelves, queuing, placing books on counter and exiting shop. I even installed a rudimentary pathing system so they don't get stuck as easily on objects, and I also added a feature that lets the player push the NPCs around, so even if they get stuck you can push them around.

It was funny at first but now it irks me. I think it’s downright unattractive and really puts me off him when he gets like it. He’s always tired, never wants to do anything, I gave up a lot for him to be with him, which isn’t a problem necessarily, but when I look at what I got for my efforts it really makes me a bit resentful. I keep telling him to go to the doctor in case there’s an underlying issue, he won’t. He’s lazy about his health. He’s always going on about how little sleep he got the night before, but I know that’s BS because I’ve been awake several times for long periods during the night and know he was sleeping soundly at the time he says he was awake. He’s been tested for sleep apnea so it’s not that. It seems to be this bragging game - who has it the hardest? I’m sick of it. It’s getting to the stage where I’m just not feeling physically attracted anymore. Anyway, rant over, thanks for reading. submitted by /u/ShadowSelf80 to r/Marriage [link] [comments]",

(If you don't care then this will waste your time) For me, it honestly ruined the game for me. I halted any further hunting and deemed all the shinies I had as worthless. I know that sounds dumb as hell. At the time, I actually never really thought about how the balls would carry over at all. Of course it does make sense why they went with the strange ball route, but I still wish it would've just been regular balls instead. It's such a shame because I think PLA is imo one of the best Pokemom games ever made, it terms of atmosphere. I loved just being in it while doing monotonous tasks like hunting or gathering materials. Jubilife Village's theme has got to be one of the best game tracks I've ever heard. I get warm goosebumps anytime I hear it in Youtube videos i watch. I'm coping for a way to eventually swap pokeballs (albeit very restrictive of course) in a future game. I would immediately go back to PLA and pick right back up where I was in a heartbeat. Anyway, how did you guys feel? Did your soul leave your body like mine did?

      "content": "The majority of game developers reccomend that you splash a substantial amount of cash on getting a professional steam capsule made for your indie game, but spending something like $500-700 on capsule art seems insane to me. Is it really that worth it? My game's wishlist count is very low at the moment (50, increasing by ~1 a day), so that kind of money could be unwise since it might mean my game doesn't make any ROI. At the same time though, I am hoping that releasing a demo would give my game a lot more coverage by streamers and having good capsule art for that is incredibly important. So it feels like a chicken-and-egg situation where I don't know for sure wether my game will be successful enough to make a commission worth it, but at the same time my game could get a lot more coverage if I had one. It's a bit of a gamble is what I'm saying. Don't get me wrong, that isn't the only thing about my steam page which might be reducing wishlists (all of which I am working on), but the capsule art definitely seems to be the biggest white elephant. Peoples reactions to the game on social media have been small but very positive recently which gives me confidence but I don't know if that equates the same as being successful enough to earn more than the $800 I will have to spend to make it. Is it worth it? I would love to know what you think, especially people who have done the same. My steam store page purely for reference. submitted by /u/spicedruid [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Recently I thought Birdo could be a good candidate, not to replace Yoshi, but both characters sharing the role and how she fit the aesthetic of the games. Both would contrast with similar egg throwing physics and suction for egg production. Yoshi uses his tongue to pull in enemies and Birdo could use her mouth for suction at close range. Initially It seem to have work mostly in favor for Baby Mario due to the wider arsenal of mechanics. You could go more in depth and level locked stages per partner, Birdo having slightly different mechanics than Yoshi. For transformations, a balloon, vacuum cleaner, dump truck and wrecking ball seem to make the most sense for Birdo. submitted by /u/DajuanKev to r/Mario [link] [comments]",

Not even speaking from a \"Blazer fans are already a shafted minority and deserve their happy ending\" perspective like he's saying here, but I feel like Mandy, while being disappointed in Robert's decision to kill Shroud (as she is in the final game), would also completely understand Robert's feelings and what led him to make that decision - even more so if you chose the option where Robert acknowledges that it wasn't a morally \"right\" thing to do. She even laughs at his \"It was kinda like masturbating\" comparison. Mandy had already threatened to kill people at the bar when rescuing Robert from Shroud (obviously not the same thing as murdering someone you've already beaten, but still). I feel like she'd also understand how personal it was to Robert considering what Shroud did to his father. I don't think she'd be the kind of person to distance herself from him over that decision. submitted by /u/FallingBullfrog to r/DispatchAdHoc [link] [comments]",

We have one actually good player and everyone else is decent. I have the least amount of minutes on the team and I’m the tallest player. I posted stats from the season and I have the least amount of minutes (#20). #2 is the player who plays ahead of me. I play at the 5 position and in practice we just run plays like robots where i’m standing at the block. I never get the chance to show the coaches I can actually play but I’ve ran with my team with no coaches and freedom and I look like the best player out there, even ahead of our one good player. I’m stuck in an endless cycle of not being able to prove my worth to the coaches. I get in for the last 5 minutes of the game when we’re already down 30 points and i’m cold off the bench and I can’t show them in practice because i’m pinned to the post. I’m scared talking to him will just make him play me even less because he has told people i’m the worst player on the team. What should I do? If I talk to him what should I ask him?

      "title": "OPUS MAGNUM – Völlige Gesundheit (VIP-Paket) Erfahrungen – Dein Weg zu nachhaltigem Wohlbefinden?",
      "content": "Eins direkt vorweg: Das Thema Gesundheit ist für mich schon immer eine Herzensangelegenheit gewesen. Aber Hand aufs Herz, im Dschungel der unzähligen Gesundheits-Tipps, Diäten und Wundermittel verliert man schnell den Überblick. Was mich neugierig auf das OPUS MAGNUM – Völlige Gesundheit (VIP-Paket) gemacht hat, war die Aussicht auf einen ganzheitlichen Ansatz. Nicht nur Symptome bekämpfen, sondern die Wurzeln meiner Gesundheitsprobleme verstehen und angehen. Ich wollte wissen, ob dieses Programm wirklich das Potenzial hat, mein Wohlbefinden auf ein neues Level zu heben. Also habe ich mich entschieden, es für dich (und natürlich auch für mich selbst!) genauer unter die Lupe zu nehmen. JETZT MEHR ERFAHREN → Was ist OPUS MAGNUM – Völlige Gesundheit (VIP-Paket)? Das OPUS MAGNUM – Völlige Gesundheit (VIP-Paket) ist weit mehr als nur ein weiterer Online-Kurs. Es ist ein umfassendes Programm, das darauf abzielt, deine Gesundheit von Grund auf zu transformieren. Das Konzept dahinter ist die \"Völlige Gesundheit\", ein Zustand, in dem Körper, Geist und Seele im Einklang sind. Es geht nicht nur darum, Krankheiten zu vermeiden, sondern aktiv ein Leben voller Energie, Vitalität und mentaler Klarheit zu führen. Hinter diesem Programm stecken Experten, die ihr Wissen und ihre Erfahrungen gebündelt haben, um einen Weg zu mehr Wohlbefinden aufzuzeigen, der wissenschaftlich fundiert und gleichzeitig praxisnah ist. Es ist eine Art Masterplan für deine Gesundheit, der dich Schritt für Schritt an die Hand nimmt. Warum OPUS MAGNUM – Völlige Gesundheit (VIP-Paket) anders ist / Was macht OPUS MAGNUM – Völlige Gesundheit (VIP-Paket) besonders? Was mich persönlich am OPUS MAGNUM – Völlige Gesundheit (VIP-Paket) besonders angesprochen hat, ist der ganzheitliche Ansatz und die Tiefe, mit der die Themen behandelt werden. Es ist keine schnelle Pille, sondern ein Weg, der auf Nachhaltigkeit setzt. **Ganzheitlicher Ansatz:** Im Gegensatz zu vielen anderen Programmen, die oft nur einen Aspekt der Gesundheit beleuchten (z.B. Ernährung oder Fitness), betrachtet OPUS MAGNUM den Menschen als Ganzes. Es geht um körperliche, geistige und seelische Gesundheit im Zusammenspiel. **Wissenschaftlich fundiertes Wissen:** Die Inhalte basieren auf aktuellen wissenschaftlichen Erkenntnissen und werden verständlich aufbereitet. Das gibt mir als Nutzerin das Vertrauen, dass ich hier keine fragwürdigen Ratschläge bekomme. **Praxisnahe Umsetzung:** Es gibt nicht nur Theorie, sondern auch konkrete Anleitungen und Übungen, die man sofort in den Alltag integrieren kann. Das macht es leicht, ins Handeln zu kommen. **Umfangreiches VIP-Paket:** Das VIP-Paket bietet zusätzlichen Support, tiefere Einblicke und exklusive Inhalte, die über das Standardprogramm hinausgehen. Das Gefühl, besonders betreut zu werden, empfand ich als sehr wertvoll. Was bekommst du konkret? Das VIP-Paket ist wirklich prall gefüllt und lässt kaum Wünsche offen. Hier ein Überblick, was du alles erwarten kannst: **Umfassende Videolektionen:** Hochwertig produzierte Videos, die komplexe Themen einfach und anschaulich erklären. Ich habe gemerkt, wie viel Mühe hier in die Didaktik gesteckt wurde. **Interaktive Arbeitsbücher und Leitfäden:** Begleitmaterial, das dir hilft, das Gelernte zu vertiefen und direkt anzuwenden. Ich fand es super, dass ich mir Notizen machen und meine Fortschritte verfolgen konnte. **Exklusive VIP-Boni:** Dazu gehören oft zusätzliche Masterclasses, Live-Q&A-Sessions mit Experten oder Zugang zu einer exklusiven Community. Diese direkten Austauschmöglichkeiten waren für mich ein echtes Highlight. **Meditations- und Entspannungsübungen:** Spezielle Anleitungen, um den Geist zu beruhigen und Stress abzubauen. Ich habe einige davon fest in meine Abendroutine integriert. **Ernährungspläne und Rezeptsammlungen:** Konkrete Vorschläge für eine gesunde und genussvolle Ernährung, die leicht umzusetzen sind. **Bewegungsroutinen:** Anleitungen für einfache, aber effektive Übungen, die du zu Hause durchführen kannst, um deine körperliche Fitness zu verbessern. **Regelmäßige Updates und Erweiterungen:** Das Programm wird kontinuierlich weiterentwickelt und um neue Inhalte ergänzt, sodass du immer auf dem neuesten Stand bleibst. https://preview.redd.it/m2hlcjlgodeg1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e8ef90ac69d529f15b1dd252782721b9a50ce67 JETZT MEHR ERFAHREN → Mein Test: So habe ich OPUS MAGNUM – Völlige Gesundheit (VIP-Paket) erlebt Als ich mit dem OPUS MAGNUM – Völlige Gesundheit (VIP-Paket) gestartet bin, war ich gespannt, ob es meinen Erwartungen gerecht werden würde. Und ich muss sagen: Es hat wirklich überzeugt! Mein erster Eindruck war die hohe Qualität der Videolektionen. Die Inhalte sind nicht nur fundiert, sondern auch sehr motivierend aufbereitet. Ich habe mich nie gelangweilt gefühlt, sondern immer das Gefühl gehabt, etwas Neues und Wertvolles zu lernen. Was mich besonders überrascht hat, war die Tiefe, mit der auf die mentalen Aspekte der Gesundheit eingegangen wird. Ich hatte erwartet, viel über Ernährung und Bewegung zu lernen (was ich auch getan habe!), aber die Lektionen zu Stressmanagement, Achtsamkeit und positiver Psychologie waren für mich ein echter Game Changer. Ich habe gelernt, besser mit Druck umzugehen und meine Gedanken bewusster zu steuern. Die Meditationsübungen waren anfangs eine kleine Herausforderung für mich, aber mit der Zeit konnte ich eine deutliche Verbesserung meiner Konzentration und inneren Ruhe feststellen. Ich habe über einen Zeitraum von mehreren Wochen die Empfehlungen zur Ernährung umgesetzt und bin begeistert, wie einfach es war, kleine Veränderungen mit großer Wirkung zu erzielen. Ich fühle mich energiegeladener und meine Verdauung hat sich spürbar verbessert. Auch die Integration der Bewegungseinheiten in meinen Alltag fiel mir leichter, als ich dachte. Es geht nicht darum, sich zu quälen, sondern darum, den Körper auf eine Weise zu stärken, die Freude macht. Der Austausch in der VIP-Community war ebenfalls ein großer Pluspunkt. Es ist motivierend, sich mit Gleichgesinnten auszutauschen, Fragen zu stellen und Unterstützung zu finden. Das Gefühl, nicht allein auf diesem Weg zu sein, hat mir zusätzlich Auftrieb gegeben. Für wen lohnt sich OPUS MAGNUM – Völlige Gesundheit (VIP-Paket)? Das OPUS MAGNUM – Völlige Gesundheit (VIP-Paket) ist meiner Meinung nach für eine breite Zielgruppe geeignet, die ihre Gesundheit wirklich ernst nimmt und bereit ist, aktiv daran zu arbeiten. **Menschen, die nach einem ganzheitlichen Gesundheitskonzept suchen:** Wenn du genug davon hast, dich nur auf einzelne Symptome zu konzentrieren und stattdessen die Ursachen deiner Beschwerden angehen möchtest. **Personen, die ihre Energie und Vitalität steigern wollen:** Wenn du dich oft müde, ausgelaugt oder energielos fühlst und nach Wegen suchst, deine Lebenskraft zu reaktivieren. **Jeder, der Stress reduzieren und mentale Klarheit gewinnen möchte:** Wenn du unter Stress leidest, dich schwer konzentrieren kannst oder einfach mehr innere Ruhe suchst. **Gesundheitsbewusste, die ihr Wissen vertiefen möchten:** Wenn du bereits an deiner Gesundheit arbeitest, aber noch fundiertere Informationen und konkrete Strategien suchst. **Einsteiger, die einen klaren Fahrplan brauchen:** Wenn du noch am Anfang deines Gesundheitsweges stehst und eine strukturierte Anleitung benötigst. Kritische Punkte / Worauf du achten musst Obwohl ich vom OPUS MAGNUM – Völlige Gesundheit (VIP-Paket) sehr überzeugt bin, gibt es ein paar Punkte, die du beachten solltest, um realistische Erwartungen zu haben: **Keine schnelle Lösung:** Das Programm verspricht keine Wunder über Nacht. Es erfordert Zeit, Engagement und die Bereitschaft, Gewohnheiten zu ändern. Wer eine Sofortlösung sucht, wird hier vielleicht enttäuscht sein. **Eigenverantwortung ist gefragt:** Die Inhalte sind hervorragend, aber du musst sie auch aktiv umsetzen. Niemand kann die Arbeit für dich erledigen. Deine eigene Motivation ist entscheidend für den Erfolg. **Preisliche Investition:** Das VIP-Paket ist eine Investition. Auch wenn der Mehrwert meiner Meinung nach den Preis rechtfertigt, solltest du dir bewusst sein, dass es kein Low-Budget-Produkt ist. Überlege, ob du bereit bist, diesen Betrag für deine Gesundheit zu investieren. **Informationsflut am Anfang:** Gerade zu Beginn kann die Menge an Informationen überwältigend wirken. Nimm dir die Zeit, alles in deinem Tempo durchzugehen und dich nicht unter Druck zu setzen. Mein Fazit zu OPUS MAGNUM – Völlige Gesundheit (VIP-Paket) Mein persönliches Fazit zum OPUS MAGNUM – Völlige Gesundheit (VIP-Paket) fällt durchweg positiv aus. Ich habe in den letzten Wochen so viel über meinen Körper, meinen Geist und die Zusammenhänge gelernt, wie selten zuvor. Das Programm ist extrem gut strukturiert, die Inhalte sind fundiert und die Umsetzung in den Alltag ist dank der praktischen Anleitungen wirklich machbar. Ich fühle mich nicht nur körperlich fitter und energiegeladener, sondern auch mental ausgeglichener. Es ist eine Investition in deine Gesundheit, die sich meiner Meinung nach langfristig auszahlt. Wenn du bereit bist, aktiv an deiner \"Völligen Gesundheit\" zu arbeiten und einen ganzheitlichen Weg suchst, dann kann ich dir das OPUS MAGNUM – Völlige Gesundheit (VIP-Paket) wärmstens empfehlen. Es ist ein wertvoller Begleiter auf dem Weg zu einem vitaleren und glücklicheren Leben. JETZT MEHR ERFAHREN → submitted by /u/Glittering-Sundae228 to r/DigiVertrau [link] [comments]",

On the other hand I am a bit burned out from the constant rake-stepping decisions from Microsoft and Steam has such good will with its consumers. I’m also unsure of how future proof the Steam machine will be based on reports of its weaker than expected specs.

I’ve seen the basic tips like making sure you keep up with the stuff that needs time to upgrade like mounts and research, but are there any good tips out there for group play? I know MSQ and alliance and some misc stuff is solo only, but how wonky is coop as far as keeping everyone on track together? Group guy spends most of his solo time doing non-combat related gathering (for example, fishing and mining in new world was his thing), is that viable to do here with minimal combat required/not messing up any group related questing (I.e., if he goes to gather in a random cave that deals with a random quest, will the quest trigger just because he’s there or does it have to be activated outside beforehand?). As far as class and playstyle, one wants to dual wield DK dps and the other wants some kind of nightblade dps. Is it realistic for me to both tank and heal? I’m thinking warden maybe? Or Templar? Any tips for those who have multiple friends that only want to dps? We are excited to get started. Any vets with some fun early tips and tricks for new groups getting ready to play?

Whenever we're watching TV and there's a tank on screen he'll go \"oh that's an M63 Sea Lion Mk. II, it's a German tank\" or something like that. You can probably tell that I'm not so knowledgeable on the topic lol. Anyway, I want to make a drinking game where everyone at the party has a piece of paper with a picture of a tank on it, and at some point in the night they show it to my friend. If he can guess the tank the person with the paper drinks, if he can't guess it then he drinks. The only problem is I don't know anything about tanks! So I'm hoping to get some help coming up with a list of about 15 tanks with names and pictures for my friend to guess. Ideally he'd get about 3/4 of them right (it is a party for him after all) with a range of difficulty. He did used to play a lot of war thunder and watch YouTubers who do war game content if that helps get an idea of how hard to make it.

      "content": "Since Anthropic is now enforcing their TOS and we are forced to use the Claude Code harness if we are using subscription tokens I thought this would be timely to ask the question. > What workarounds are people building for the claude code harness? For example, I have noticed a lot of people are building slash command workarounds for compaction to prevent context rot. What about the Todos? Are you tracking your todos somewhere separate or just letting claude do the tracking? In this particular case I have seen todo items get crossed off Claude's list without fully implementing them. This could be related to context rot --- i have not had todo item issues since compacting at 50%. Also, I noticed there is browser control built in to claude so does that mean it's better to use that than the trusty playwright mcp? There might be other aspects to claude code that people are building workarounds for and was wondering what all that might be? submitted by /u/Helpful_Intern_1306 to r/ClaudeCode [link] [comments]",

I guess I'm in two minds because there are ideas for games that I think would be amazing, and extremely fun and that I would love working on but actually the process of making it has it become tedious or boring. In a similar vein, I was wondering whether, being a huge fan of a franchise that you become lucky enough to be hired for ruins it.

They hold the item name, damage it does and an icon associated with the item. I am trying to display this icon within a UI element. However, when I try to access the texture, I can get the array but not the items in it. Here's my code: panel / itemPanel.gd (UI node i want to hold the image in): extends Panel var item: TextureRect = $aspRect/color/item var player: CharacterBody3D = $\"../player\" const FL_STUDIO = preload(\"uid://cky184lm61gh3\") @export var itemSlot: int # Called every frame. 'delta' is the elapsed time since the previous frame. func _process(delta: float) -> void: if player: item.texture = FL_STUDIO print(player.heldItems.values().get(itemSlot)) body / body.gd (AreaBody2D, child of a parent node, iconName and iconTxtr are vars within a script in the parent node): extends Area3D var parent: Node3D = $\"..\" @onready var mesh: MeshInstance3D = $\"../mesh\" func _on_body_entered(body: Node3D) -> void: if body.heldItems.size() < body.maxItems: var items = body.heldItems var itemStats: Array = [parent.itemName, parent.changeHealth, parent.iconTxtr] items[items.size()] = itemStats parent.queue_free() else: print(\"inventory full!\") Right now this accesses the array I need within the dictionary, but I can't actually get the values out of the arrays. I had attempted to look up the answer but had found no solution. Whenever I try to access the values in the array, I get error message \"Invalid access to property or key 'itemSlot' on a base object of type 'Dictionary[int, Array]'.\" It appears the error is on line 14 of itemPanel.gd.

      "content": "Hello, I'm making this request for jackbox party pack 3, but I'd be cool with any of them to be honest. I would play this with my family during family game nights that we have pretty often. We normally play games on Netflix like Boggle Party on the living room tv. I've played jackbox party pack 3 many years ago on an Xbox we no longer have and had a fun time playing it. That is why I put this specific one on the request post. I plan to play this on my steam deck and connect it with a dock I currently have connected to our living room tv. I have extended family that I could play this with as well. Since we visit them often and the steam deck is portable, it would not require any extra effort to just bring over my steam deck and its dock. I could even bring this to my friends' dorm rooms at the university I go too. We normally sing karaoke but I think bringing my steam deck and dock over would add some variety. Now that I think about it, I might even be able to figure out a way to play this with online family and friends that don't live close by. I would make great use of a jackbox party game and play it quite often with family and friends. Thanks for taking the time to read this! TLDR: I'd play this game on a docked steam deck during family game nights, with extended family, friends at the university that I attend, and maybe even family and friends that don't live close by. I'd play this game a lot and share fun experiences with many others.

I guess they wanted to showcase every strategy, maybe with a tinge of making players suffer a bit. I'm aware of most of the mons that come with OHKO moves in the frontier at this point, but this one was a delightful new discovery during my Tower grind. I luckily survived 4 or 5 turns of it with my last Pokemon. submitted by /u/Supra_Mayro to r/PokemonEmerald [link] [comments]",
