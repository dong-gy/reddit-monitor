      "content": "Hey guys, As the title suggests, which way is \"better\" to go when it comes to the art style. I ask this in a very broad and general sense. Although I am relatively knew to Godot itself (not programming) I consider myself to be a decent artist. I can do Pixel art no problem (in Aseprite, for example). I'm not too familiar with vector art tho, but I can learn. My question is which one has the better reception. Is pixel art overall easier to handle? Or doesn't matter? Also, what about resolution? What exactly should I do to prevent distortions and visual glitches? Thanks! submitted by /u/crowkk [link] [comments]",

I’d really love for you to try it out and share your honest feedback.

Instead, as a and b get closer to being opposites, the returned angle is closer to 0. The more a and b point towards the same direction, the closer the returned angle is to π. Why exactly is that?

They pointed out: The game most likely stores which feather you've shot/\"taken\" down, regardless of how they respawn, and this game memory most likely reset once you've hit all of them. It then checks if you did it in the correct order, if not, no trigger. And this is precisely what I was wondering for the longest time. Shouldn't such game logic be relatively easy to find in the code? Why did none of the crazy Reddit RDR2 detectives find anything similar yet? Even before that, can we somehow infer from the code whether the spider webs or the feathers are triggers that change the game state in any way? submitted by /u/alasthennars to r/reddeadmysteries [link] [comments]",
