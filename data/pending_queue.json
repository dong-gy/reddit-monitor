      "content": "So I just had an idea for a board game where it’ll be 4-6 players and based around some souvenirs or similar things people collect, such as spoons, stamps, coins, etc. Each player gets a different item, and collects like 25 on their player board, going around the game board with different cards that give boosts, debuffs, and other things. Best comparison for the game board I can think of is Mario party. Just wondering if there’s a collection-based game like this out there(the specific items, not the concept), or if it’s something somewhat original? submitted by /u/Firefox_1607 [link] [comments]",

      "content": "The Gist: Basically, the industry is eyeing VR to solve the \"engagement\" problem. Traditional sweepstakes can feel a bit flat since you're just clicking a screen, so they’re looking at VR to create 3D casino floors where you can walk around as an avatar and chat with other players via voice. The Pros: Social Connection: It turns solo gaming into a social hangout, which is a big deal for the \"social casino\" vibe. New Revenue: Operators are looking at selling digital \"extras\" (like avatar skins or VIP table access) rather than just coin packs. Better Data: They can track exactly what players look at and interact with in a 3D space to tweak the games. The Reality Check: The article is pretty honest about the hurdles. Most people don't own high-end VR headsets yet, and \"tech nausea\" (motion sickness) is still a thing. Plus, it’s expensive for devs to build these worlds, and if the player base isn't there, the ROI is shaky. Verdict: It's likely not going to replace your mobile sweepstakes apps anytime soon because of the \"convenience factor,\" but we’ll probably see more hybrid AR (Augmented Reality) features popping up first since everyone already has a smartphone. TL;DR: VR is definitely coming to sweepstakes for the \"wow\" factor, but hardware costs mean it'll stay a niche for a while.

      "content": "After about a year of work, I’ve just released the Lost Host demo on Steam! The demo offers around 20 minutes of gameplay, and I highly encourage you to try to play it until the end. This really helps with visibility on Steam, and more importantly - it helps me understand how the game feels from a player’s perspective. Lost Host is a small atmospheric game about a toy car searching for its missing boy (its owner). You’ll explore environments, solve light puzzles, push and carry small objects, and jump your way through the world. I’d describe it as a mystical exploration-focused experience. This is an almost-solo project, so I’d really appreciate any feedback, bug reports, or suggestions. If you enjoy it, sharing the demo somewhere would mean a lot - especially since today (Jan 15) is also my birthday :> submitted by /u/Additional_Bug5485 [link] [comments]",

      "content": "When I use the forgot my password function in Facebook and enter my mobile, other profiles that aren't mine show up. How could this have happened without access to my phone? I thought Facebook accounts could only be linked to mobile phone numbers after they have been authenticated with an SMS? I've considered some of the obvious answers, like the below, but they don't seem applicable in this case. I believe I know the person that has set up the accounts, and that they were set up or linked to my mobile recently as they did not show up before now. I'm confident it's not: that my mobile number has been recycled that the account was set up prior to Facebook verifying phone numbers that my phone has been ported (it hasn't) I haven't provided a security code to anyone Is there any other way this could have been linked to my mobile? submitted by /u/hiimtim88 to r/facebook [link] [comments]",

My plans for today is to study some more SQL coding, then play some video games and also going to the gym and doing my usual upper body session. I'm currently sitting in the kitchen sipping on some Monster Energy (the white one) while making this post instead of cobbee, I think that's enough caffeine for me for today!
