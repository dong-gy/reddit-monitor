      "content": "I remember staring at the PS5 shelves, wondering if the Pro was really worth the extra cash. Here’s the thing: if you don’t currently have a 4K TV or aren’t chasing ultra-high refresh rates, the Pro’s benefits are minimal. Most games that offer Pro enhancements make you choose between higher frame rates or better visuals anyway, so the “best of both worlds” pitch doesn’t really land. For someone playing single-player story-driven games like Horizon, Spider-Man 2, or Elden Ring, the base PS5 handles them beautifully. Adding a disc drive can actually save you money in the long run by letting you buy cheaper physical copies or secondhand games. The Pro only really shines if you plan to invest in a 4K 120hz setup in the future or want that extra storage, since it comes with a bigger internal drive. From my experience, focusing on offline play lets you ignore the Pro’s minor advantages and just enjoy the games as intended. You still get all the major features and stunning visuals on the base model, and if you ever upgrade your monitor or TV, you can consider the Pro down the line. For anyone in the same boat, are you going for the Slim and saving the difference, or planning to future-proof with the Pro? submitted by /u/edward_dd to r/PlayStation_X [link] [comments]",

      "content": "'The drinking and eating disorders of people may be just as much a compulsion as sexual orientation. And people may be drawn or even compelled beyond their personal control toward alcoholism, drug use or obesity by natural inheritance as well as emotional trauma and addiction. No one would dare say that these individuals or members of society cannot change these unfruitful and sometimes even destructive behavior or damaging practices. No one would think it is okay to buy alcohol for or encourage an alcoholic to drink. The changing of compulsive behavior often requires a more in depth approach to the problem or practice than many are willing to make. Many of the conditions labelled as problematic are really only symptoms of deeper issues. Treating the symptom seldom helps in overcoming the problem. In fact such treatment may merely mask the real problem behind more symptoms and/or side effects. Ideas that become accepted in the mind as unchangeable facts can become immune to reason, being rooted deeper in the mind of men than they are willing to go. To even question those ideas is often perceived as a personal attack and source of anger and fear. If someone can be groomed to accept an idea or a pattern of behavior, that behavior is not the product of birth but of external influence that may have infected the individual. You cannot rightfully address the mentally accepted behavior without addressing the mental influence of the grooming and the presence of the vulnerability that allowed the grooming to become effective. It may also be true that strongly conservative religious views that lead an individual to seek to change themselves in their sexual orientation are often motivating and even driving the process through a form of ideological grooming. Their own religious beliefs may be a product of preprogrammed religious practices and rituals that resulted in their own Mass Formation of Psychosis.' preparingyou.com/wiki/Homosexuality #AbolishHumanArchism #RepentWithUs #ChristianAnarchy https://preview.redd.it/27677jsy4leg1.jpg?width=7700&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ae7e57f4ae41e731057b1208b015c03f4845c009 submitted by /u/AbolishHumanArchism to u/AbolishHumanArchism [link] [comments]",

I have 4 solutions: add more ways to find them for free, decide which resources we want to use at 2000, put a change of coins and energy points so it would solve all the problems of those accounts that have too many energy points and lastly put a shop just for resources, in exchange for seasonal cups, where we can spend them either for mega boxes or for resources submitted by /u/CraftRough6320 to r/Brawlstars [link] [comments]",

After several days of development, that exploration resulted in a set of Blueprint components that integrate seamlessly into any project. Once the system felt stable and flexible enough, I decided to publish it on Fab so other developers—especially indie teams—could use it to create more impactful, branching narratives. Hopefully it can be useful to others experimenting with narrative-driven systems.

We loved so much about our old art, but found that at conventions, it gave people the wrong impression. People would see our banners and immediately assume our game was a point and click mystery rather than a dystopic work sim set in a 3D environment. I do think we lose a sense of the narrative focus of the game with our new capsule, but capture the vibes of the gameplay in a more tangible way.

This quest for Shiny Pets has seen me through a new and better job, my son turning 2 and 3, my daughter turning 1 and 2, a root canal, week long trips to Vegas and Alaska, my dog’s surgery on his eye, my grandmother succumbing to dementia, me winning $500 on a scratch off, my weight-loss journey losing over 30lbs so far, getting a shoutout from the devs, all of life’s ups and downs. Throughout everything I’ve been through, this was something that kept me constant. Kept me going even during the hard times and giving me something to look forward to everyday. Having something to do and interact with such an amazing community has been a blessing. I truly enjoyed every single time someone would comment and let me know how much they enjoyed a Shiny Pet, had ideas, questioned how Shiny Pets would work, wondered about future Shiny Pets. This started as just a funny little project but as the days climbed it became something I truly enjoyed doing. I am lucky to be part of such an amazing community, and make a name for myself as “The Shiny Pets” guy. I also want to thank Arkuni for even indulging me and adding the Shiny Pets intro animation. It really means a lot to me that I inspired something in a game that means so much to me. Even though I may not be posting everyday anymore, I’ll still be here in the subreddit. Upvoting all Sloth wins, upvoting all big PP hedgehog builds, being helpful and answering any questions for new people, theorycrafting new and crazy builds. Thank you all.

It started as a weekend experiment to make something bright, relaxing, and satisfying, and somehow turned into a full-on passion project. Our goal was to capture that feeling of “just one more move” in a colorful, logic-based puzzle world. We’ve been building different visual themes — Underwater, Neon, Egypt, Halloween, and more — to keep it fresh while you clear the board. We just launched our “Coming Soon” page on Steam, and we’d love to know what you think of how it’s shaping up so far — visuals, tone, or anything that stands out (good or bad!).

My question for this subreddit is, is Godot a good choice for this sort of application?

      "content": "Portals are in a good few games now, however I don't think any of them are as complex as Ultrakill. The obvious portal game that comes to mind is Portal. You are basically only bringing stationary objects through portals, the most complex being Turrets. However, Turrets don't have any pathfinding, and don't even look up. They just send hitscan fire through portals. I've seen people mention other games that have \"portal mechanics\" when in reality the portals are just PNGs that teleport you to another PNG. Not seamless like the portals seen in Portal and Fraud. The closest game that is somewhat similar to the mechanics seen in Fraud is Splitgate. It has both seamless portals and combat mechanics. However, Splitgate is PvP, meaning there are no NPCs that need to pathfind through portals. I'm making this post because I don't actually know a lot about Splitgate, or any other games that might include portals (except Portal). There might already be a game that combines portals and PvE. If not, then we have a reason why Fraud is taking so long. The game devs are trying make something that has never been made before.

I was over 300m away and across a river, in Yukon. Had a couple of smaller Grizzlies between me and this beauty. Had to scare the bears away, without scaring the herd of Caribou. Managed that, walked to where the bears were, then crouched to about 120m from the herd. Just as was going to go prone, the GAME moved the 💎 Bou (actually moved him 3 times. No he didn’t move on his own, the game just moved him). I was pissed I was gonna have try another day, but saw he was still there, just behind some other Bou. I crawled to about 40m when a 3rd Bou moved in front of the 💎. I side-crawled to get him in sight, while not spooking 3 MORE Bou just to the left of me. Finally got enough of an area of his chest to make the shot. I wish I would have thought to take a pic of how tight the shot actually was, but was so intent on what I was doing, I didn’t think of it.

      "content": "Sorry for only having one image, as I don't have time to make more. I'm not mistaken, but maybe this CD is from 2008, however I found this game made in the Game Maker engine. It was called... QUIZZES. The game was a quiz mixed with YTPBR, with random characters, eurodance and trance music with the famous \"This is Sparta\" remix. And besides national rock, also Mamonas, Charlie Brown Jr., and hardcore punk from some Brazilian demo tape in 90s. And also, when you complete every 10 or 15 questions, a very well-animated cutscene appears, like 1st cutscene: Katy Kat from Parappa the Rapper, trying to invade an apartment while Concerto No. 2 in G Minor, RV 315 Summer: III. The game suddenly cuts to random characters in a bar announcing that Penny from WarioWare had been taken to the hospital after a shootout in Diamond City. However... while some scenes are completely 2D, moving in a 3D style like bitmaps in DOOM and poorly done, it looked low-budget and the rest well-animated, the game has many cutscenes dubbed in Brazilian Portuguese. They are funny, even the sixth cutscene is awesome. It showed the Syrian guy playing Casio Arabic keyboard with his feet and nose in the bar, and sadly, in the fifth cutscene, Katy Kat dies next to Lammy. The game takes 5 hours to complete and has many long cutscenes (ever cutscene is 10 minutes) that could make a movie. It's like a toy/game for Master System and Mega Drive, Pense Bem from Tectoy.

      "content": "Making a CAVE-style shmup (posted a WIP video couple of weeks ago, literally last post on my account). Its gameplay is centered around playing aggressively, close to the enemies and to the top of the screen (you get medals that increase a score multiplier for doing so). Thing is, I wanna introduce a rank system that increases both the enemy bullet pattern density and speed. But I don't really know how I should go around growing it? What does the player have to do to grow it? I don't wanna directly penalize the player for, well, playing better, but I also want them to play on a rank level that's challenging for them. In other words, increasing the rank should be AWARDED even though it makes the game more difficult. Players should strive to play at the highest rank their skill can get them. How should I go about this? I read you! submitted by /u/Zeroeth_0 to r/shmups [link] [comments]",

The scary thing is that even if they fixed all of the horrifying garbage they've been jamming down our throats all it would do is revert the game to how it was only a couple months ago, and even that game is extremely flawed and needs attention. But the game is SO bad that those issues don't even crack the top 30 when I'm loading into a match for a supposed \"competitive\" mode and get thrashed by a guy with towers and cards a full level above mine with two heroes. And ever since lvl 16, you can forget about ladder lol. I've played this game for so long and I love it so much, but I just cannot subject myself to this torture any longer.

      "content": "Just yesterday, I launched my first steam page for my hard sci-fi roguelike ( Pilot 6174 ). Think HighFleet meets KSP . Currently, my capsule art is just a 3D render of the in-game cockpit. I chose this route as I wanted to focus on the \"Simulation / Diegetic UI\" aspect that defines the genre. Here is my data (~24 hours since page launch) Wishlists: ~ 50 (With any wishlists from family / friends / associates subtracted.) CTR (Coming Soon List): 21.43% (Although very small sample size) Page Conversion Rate: ~19% ( page visits divided by wishlist count ) The Question: I have heard (from this sub and others) that for the steam capsule art I really should hire a professional illustrator. However, considering my target audience is simulation fans, who often prefer fidelity/tech over stylized art, I'm wondering if sticking with the 3D render might be better. Does this current art look \"professional enough\" for the genre?

The MtgWiki for the plane even describes the plane as \" Escherian reality - or physics-bending effects - and kaleidoscopic geometric features.\" Seems very Reality fracture-y to me. I remember Gavin or Mark Rosewater talking years ago about how they were fascinated with the plane when it first appeared on a Plane chase card. The MtgWiki also mentions that Xerex won the player vote for plane featured on a Battle card during MOM that they most wanted to see recieve an actual set. That was in 2023... it takes ≈ 2 years to design a Magic set... what am I missing? I know there was a post about how Reality Fracture includes an innovation that was difficult to implement, but I also remember Gavin or Mark Rosewater mentioning that all cards featuring Xerex are symmetrical by design or something (I honestly don't remember exactly, I'll try to find the video or article source). And just look at the art we do have for Xerex. Xerex Strobe-Knight seems pretty Reality Fracture-y to me. Am I missing something, or is this an open and shut case?

      "content": "My bf of 4 years and I have been living together for 3.5 years and I am growing resentment for his lifestyle. I am currently in college and working full time, and he is on disability for (fetal alcohol syndrome) borderline personality disorder, and major depressive disorder. He is also receiving a 250k inheritance in a few months so he will have that to live off of. For the first 2 years of our relationship I was unemployed and living off of welfare and was really trying to find myself and get out of my depression. I felt extremely lost. I've luckily found a passion and I'm pursuing it in school and finally found a full time job and a part time job a year ago. Back when I was unemployed, I didn't mind his lifestyle because I could also play video games and relax all day. I deeply connected with him emotionally from the start, we have so much in common except for our ambition. Now that I've been working on myself a lot for the last year I've started becoming worried for our future. I imagined I'd feel this way and I wish I would have left early on before becoming way too attached. We want to have kids in the future, he's amazing at communication and he drives me whenever I need a ride to work/school. He just plays video games, day and night, from the moment he wakes up until he sleeps. He will literally wake up at 8pm and play until I leave for work at 7:30am usually. We do spend 30 minutes or 3 hours together everyday watching a show or something but then it's back to games But we are so happy living together and the intimacy is always perfect. We also have 2 cats and a whole future life imagined. I've communicated that I would really love to see him try to become more productive at least a little bit with time management, so I can feel secure with his reliability for the future, and he replies with \"well as long as im driving you and spending time with you it doesnt matter when I sleep or what I do when you're sleeping or at work\" I've expressed that it would be more attractive to me if I knew he was doing something to help him grow at least in little ways while I'm not around, to not have his whole life revolve around me and video games. This is just something we constantly fight about lately, because he sees it as an attack but I am just expressing that I am happy now, but worried that out mindsets and lifestyles will make us grow apart. I can't imagine leaving him it literally makes me want to throw up but at the same time I am so scared to be a mother who does everything herself while her man is napping cause he gamed all night. How the hell do I make a decision when he truly feels like the love of my life, but he clearly is so comfortable with how he lives I don't think he'll put that effort for me. And pf course it's even worse because he deals with bpd, fasd, and major depressive disorder. He has no family and not many friends so I feel even worse thinking about leaving him submitted by /u/ThrowRAfxntasi to r/relationshipproblems [link] [comments]",

I did a bit of debug and what's happening is that the first plant gets both the mouse position and the plant's global_position right, meanwhile the other two get the mouse position right but the global_position is completely different. I have checked all the Sprites2D and Collision areas and they all seem good. Here's the code for the spawn (this script is inside a the Level1 Node2D) func _unhandled_input(event: InputEvent) -> void: if event is InputEventMouseButton \\ and event.button_index == MOUSE_BUTTON_LEFT \\ and event.pressed \\ and can_position: call_deferred(\"spawn\") func spawn(): new_plant = plant_preload.instantiate() var tile = ground.local_to_map(ground.to_local(get_global_mouse_position())) new_plant.global_position = ground.to_global(ground.map_to_local(tile)) add_child(new_plant) can_position = false submitted by /u/Silver_Reason9629 [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Just picked up the Caspia Wool Cardigan with Embellishment from Timeless London and honestly… it’s a showstopper. It’s crafted from a finely knitted, stretchy black fabric blend with wool, so it feels soft, warm, and comfortable without being heavy. What really makes it special are the subtle rhinestones and sequins scattered across the cardigan. They catch the light beautifully and add just the right amount of sparkle without feeling over the top. I love how versatile it is. You can throw it over jeans and a tee for an elevated everyday look, or layer it with a dress for evenings when you want something cozy but still polished. It’s one of those pieces that feels timeless but still has personality. If you’re into statement knitwear that’s elegant, wearable, and a little bit glam, this one’s definitely worth checking out. submitted by /u/PangolinAdept2433 to u/PangolinAdept2433 [link] [comments]",

I had installed directX9 and VC++ somewhere in the mix and now I'm having trouble getting a vanilla installation to work. I have deleted my instance in M02 as well. I ran the pre-shipped VC++ installer, and installed VC++ 2008 after deleting it entirely. In event viewer, I can see that the game crashed with the exception code \"0xc0000005\", which is a memory-related crash, indicating the computer is trying to access invalid memory. So I think this is some kind of weird memory cache issue, although I don't have any technical knowledge as to how these internal processes work, or what to flush. I think there must be something it's trying to access that it can't, and I have no idea why. I believe it would be something being loaded into the memory at runtime, then deleted, and attempted to be accessed? Any ideas on what could be causing this? I also noticed that when I try to launch through admin that it doesn't launch at all, unsure if this is normal behavior (because I have no way to test that), and the same code appears in event viewer. submitted by /u/FBIagent67098 to r/falloutnewvegas [link] [comments]",

Ever since OFA Deku dropped, it’s been a repeat of one broken character after another. From infinite melee loops with Deku, wide area nuking with Young AFO, repeated stuns with Iron Might, unkillabe destruction with Tech Shiggy, and one shotting with Lady Nagant, we finally have someone who doesn’t have an obnoxious gimmick that defines them. I know it’s only the start of the season, but I’m already in love with Tokoyami. He feels good to use and the payoff of “trying” in this meta of powerful characters is more rewarding than you think it is. There are moments when he’s strong, and moments where he’s weak, a near perfect balance.

And with small, but constant steps, they would see improvements and finally feel hope that everything is doable. It will hurt sometimes sure, but it's doable.

I realized it didn’t work and then found out you can’t delete your psn without contacting PlayStation to get them to do it. Why? This is dumb and now I’m stuck with a psn account. I would just trade codes with like an Xbox or steam code but I’m not doing that because I’m gonna get scammed. I had the happen when I traded a Xbox nightreign beta code for a ps5 one but the one I got didn’t work so I’m assuming they scammed me. I didn’t really matter that much though since I was picked in a comment section that was giving out a code and that worked. I don’t have a ps5, I have an Xbox but it’s an Xbox one so I could play nightreign on it so I gave both ps5 ones to my friend to let them play instead.

Recently switched to DX12, and so far the game feels noticeably smoother and more stable. The heavy drops seem reduced (not completely gone yet, but definitely better). My specs: • Intel i5 11th Gen CPU • NVIDIA RTX 2050 Laptop GPU (4 GB VRAM) • 16 GB RAM Did the devs change or optimize anything in DX12 recently, or is this just a coincidence / system-specific behavior?

I've been developing a pixel art game on a 640x360 resolution that I can later scale to 720p, 1080p, etc. However, I've been reading about the freedom that gives to have a native 1080p game with scaled assets, giving the possibility of sub-pixel movement, easier UI design, etc. I'm not trying to emulate a particular gaming period so that's no really important to me. Are the biggest cons of moving to a native 1080p that I'll have to be disciplined with my asset scalings so the art doesn't look inconsistent? What else should one take into account?

      "content": "Hey everyone, I’m having a weird issue with my Razer Kraken Kitty BT Chroma RGB Wireless (Bluetooth) headset and I’m hoping someone here might have run into the same thing. I got the headset last year and it worked perfectly until around December 2025 . For context: I use the headset for audio, but I use a separate external microphone for voice input. The problem: When I play Valorant and select Razer Kraken Kitty BT as my output device , the game audio sounds super muffled and low quality — basically like trash. But if I select my microphone as the output device , the game audio suddenly sounds perfect in my headphones… The problem is: when I do that, I can’t hear voice chat at all. What’s weird: • The headset works perfectly on Discord • Music & videos sound totally normal • No issues outside of Valorant • The problem seems to be only with Valorant’s audio + voice chat combo What I’ve tried: • Switching output/input devices in Valorant • Restarting the game • Reconnecting the headset • Making sure Windows default devices are correct • Drivers • Tried Razer support, but never got an answer... Still no luck. Has anyone had this happen with Bluetooth headsets in Valorant? Is this a Valorant + Bluetooth + voice chat issue? Any fixes or workarounds would be appreciated 🙏 submitted by /u/Sea_cake_ to r/ValorantTechSupport [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Following up from my last post on Interloper I hit day 15 and 32 on the my longest runs. This latest run led me to making a fatal mistake which was underestimating just how close I was to a bear and I zigged towards him instead zagging away from him on the lonely island at coastal highway. (note I was almost full hp prior to attack) It was really dumb of me since visibility was high I could've went the other way. I also got a literal tonne of rabbits on my run and encountered my first timberwolf pack. (they scratched me a bit but I managed to light a fire and healed up quite a bit) For day 32 I died this run ended much stupider which was walking around with a rabbit in my pack then walking directly into a wolf. It seems for whatever reason whenever I start getting comfortable in the game I start getting complacent and need to mind myself of this. Personal Achievement: I managed to walk through the cave connecting Pleasant Valley and Coastal Highway without using a single light source and got through the cave in almost complete darkness. Only took me 3 tries in under an hour! Biggest Challenge: I have the worst luck with matches, on runs I either wind up finding 50 of them or zero of them.

      "content": "So I am hunting the lakes at Parque Fernando. This means I am having to make some pretty long shots. For class 3 animals, I am using the Quist Reaper 7.62x39 with Polymer tips, because it gives the best down range ballistics. I have the Zeroing Perk so I can zero my scope at 328 yards, and I can make heart shots at that range pretty consistently with this weapon. I have practiced quite a bit with this weapon over at the Hirschdorf Rifle Range at 350, 400, 450, and 500 yards, so I know where it is hitting at those ranges as well and can make pretty accurate shots at the range. However, when in actually hunting, I cannot hit anything beyond 340 yards. I have shot at dozens of animals at around 350 yards, and the bullet seems to hit a wall before reaching them. I mean, I can't even wound them in the toe at that range. The bullet just will not go past 340 yards. At 335 years I can drill them through the heart, but five yards further, I can't even hit the whole animal anywhere. Now, If switch to the 308, I can drop them all the way out to 450 yards with no problem, so I know I can hit at those ranges. It is just with the Quist Repear that I am seeing this issue. I am just wondering if this is a known glitch in the game, or if I should write a report to the devs about it submitted by /u/Jungleexplorer to r/theHunter [link] [comments]",

Somatu is a game where you solve puzzles by using the adding operation. You can beat the puzzles by changing numbers around, so that the sums are correct in all rows and columns at the same time . Start with \"Classic\" mode where you can explore different difficulty levels and play without pressure. When you are ready for a more intense experience, you can try \"Challenge\" mode. In this mode, every second counts and you can test your skill with other players. submitted by /u/obake25 to r/AndroidGaming [link] [comments]",

I previously worked on another project like this as well, but in both cases I was the only animator, so I haven’t really had anyone to confirm whether this is a “common” practice. I work with animations at 60 fps, but I don’t use constant fixed values like 10 fps for all animations. Instead, I created timing tables so the programmer can implement them exactly as I planned. The key point is that I assign different frame durations to the sprites, not arbitrarily, but because I can clearly see and feel the difference in motion. However, when researching online whether this is a common practice, I couldn’t really find much information beyond discussions about animating at 60 vs 30 fps. submitted by /u/_onlydrop [link] [comments]",

      "content": "This is something that I'm always thinking about in the back of my mind, so I wanted to put some feelers out and see if I could get some feedback/experience from others in this subreddit. For context, I'm in my late 30's and only have a GED. I did some community college on/off, but my work/learning ethic back then was terrible, so after 6 years of part-time, barely committing to college I just sorta gave up. However, this is not a pity post and I've been extremely fortunate in my work life. I have past experience (5 years) at a FAANG company, 5 years in a senior role at a STaaS company, and I'm currently a Cloud Engineer at an edge compute services company. The reason why I wanted to ask this is because during my time at FAANG, to promote higher than an L6 required a degree - no exceptions. Many people could make a lifelong career out of L6 and below very easily, but there was always that ceiling that I would never be able to break through. I've thought about places like WGU and their CS degree, but it's a lot of time/money/effort to commit and I really want to ensure I'll be able to make use of it. So, people of IT - What has your career path been like with/without a college degree? Has anyone actually started their career without out, go for one, then find a difference in their careers? submitted by /u/Karmuhhhh to r/ITCareerQuestions [link] [comments]",

Of course, if you're lucky, there are games that have been successful despite these festivals. But there's no need to take that risk . Since our indie game is ClusterCluck multiplayer, keeping the price close to normal was a mistake. ⭐Tip 2: If this is your first indie game, keep the price as low as possible and build your player base first. ⭐⭐⭐BONUS - We chose the full release date one month before the next festival so you can participate (it has to be released one month in advance from a festival), and after the one-month Steam visibility boost you receive, you get another boost with the festival! submitted by /u/GlintzGames [link] [comments]",

I’ve spent a long time in the cos community and have contributed a lot to it, but cos is becoming such a horribly neglected game that it’s getting ridiculous and I want no part in it. I sold my whole inventory and gave away some stuff, only keeping a dblr morth slot and the spec in case I come back, but I don’t think I will, unless the devs get it together. The past couple days I’ve been getting rid of my inventory, I got a good look at the trade realm, and not a single rev was less than 3k. Everything else was extremely overpriced, I had to pay nearly 25k to get a ghart because I’d accidentally put mine up on a stall for 11k, not realizing I had a slot to sell. I just think 25k for a ghart is a bit much. Not only is the cos economy completely wrecked, but the devs are extremely lazy, adding creatures with repeating features every week instead of tending to actual problems. The least this community needs right now is more creatures. This game has a lot of potential, and I’m very upset to be leaving this game, as it was my favorite game for a long time.

      "content": "Hi all, I noticed that the BESTA frame for TVs (the 70-inch wide, 15-inch tall version) states a max load of 66 pounds. The matching top panel (oak veneer) states a max load of 110 pounds. The combined weight of my media equipment (TV, speakers, gaming) is about 90 pounds, which exceeds the BESTA frame by a lot. I would like to use the TV frame with legs on the floor, add the top panel, and place the media equipment on top. But I'm confused how the top panel can hold more weight than the frame below it. I'm worried that the frame will collapse, even with the top panel installed. Does anyone know if this would work? Or is there another IKEA hack I can use to make sure that this design can hold at least 90 pounds? Or is the whole thing limited to 66 pounds because that is what the frame is designed to hold?

It's a pixel art game about social anxiety and most of the screens depict chat conversations and similar stuff. And yeah, I'm having a really hard time with the sound effects, the game already looks a bit light hearted because of the pixel art and the colors, which it's kind of softened by the theme and it ends up fitting well, but any kind of sound effect I try pushes the vibe to just silly and a bit ridiculous. And I've been at it for a while now. I know in the end it's not that deep because it's a very small project, but it's one of the first ones I make and it hits some personal spots so I don't want to get stuck here and end up shelving it, especially because the rest is all finished already.

After months of solo development, the playable demo of Late Lines FM is now officially live on Steam! 🎙️😱 This demo is about 20-25 minutes long and offers a glimpse into the atmosphere I’ve been building. Please keep in mind that the full game will feature a much deeper story, more complex mechanics, and various puzzles that aren't in the demo yet. As a solo developer, I’m still working hard on bug fixes and optimization . You might encounter some rough edges, and I truly appreciate your patience. I would love to hear your honest feedback—positive or negative— please leave a review on Steam if you have a moment! It helps me tremendously in improving the final game. Also, if you run into any specific bugs, feel free to reach out to me directly on Discord. You can play the demo here: Store Page Late Lines FM Discord Server: Discord If you enjoy the atmosphere, adding the game to your wishlist would be a huge help.

Because of the nausea, NOTHING sounds appetizing to me. If I try and eat rice crackers to fill my stomach, I find myself randomly getting sick mid chew. I just threw up at work yesterday after a wave of nausea hit me after some apple sauce. By mid day, I am STARVING. Like my body is shutting down starving. I force myself to eat something that I can chew without wanting to gag, and find that I still feel starving!!! Last night, I went and got pasta for dinner. I only was able to eat a small amount before I felt extremely full, however I still felt HUNGRY. Basically, nothing sounds good, and when I do eat, I don't feel satisfied. It's driving me a little crazy, as I work 8:30-6:30 pm right now and have an hour commute both ways to work. It's really making me feel miserable. I have anti-acids when I need and morning sickness gummies with ginger and b6 (I also take vitamin D and B every night with my fish oil, prenatal, and iron supplement) but nothing seems to help. I've been underweight my entire life, so I'm a small gal. But I can't bear to lose weight right now when I should be eating at least a full days calories...but I just can't.

I usually use dualsensex to emulate Xbox or ps4 controller but neither worked. Then I checked steam settings for controller and noticed I have a lot of controller devices. It was because I had keyboard with pressure sensor. After pressing buttons on keyboard in gamepad mode game finally recognized some (not all) inputs from controller. So if you have similar problem try disable all you other controller devices in device manager or unplug them because game seems to have problem when you have few simultaneously. Solution to my exact problem was just disable gamepad mode in keyboard altogether but I hope devs fixes this because going to keyboard settings each time is annoying submitted by /u/fixthgame to r/Endfield [link] [comments]",

After months of solo development, the playable demo of Late Lines FM is now officially live on Steam! 🎙️😱 This demo is about 20-25 minutes long and offers a glimpse into the atmosphere I’ve been building. Please keep in mind that the full game will feature a much deeper story, more complex mechanics, and various puzzles that aren't in the demo yet. As a solo developer, I’m still working hard on bug fixes and optimization . You might encounter some rough edges, and I truly appreciate your patience. I would love to hear your honest feedback—positive or negative— please leave a review on Steam if you have a moment! It helps me tremendously in improving the final game. Also, if you run into any specific bugs, feel free to reach out to me directly on Discord. You can play the demo here: Store Page Late Lines FM Discord Server: Discord If you enjoy the atmosphere, adding the game to your wishlist would be a huge help.

I found that the best way to make my hand drawn sprites look the best is by drawing a small one (goblin) at 256x256 down scaling it to 128x128 in gimp and then importing it to Godot where I zoom out with the camera to make it smaller on the screen. This was after 4 hours of research and testing stuff out. Then for an ogre I would make it at 512x512 and put it down to 256x256. Is this the best practice for getting art into my game, then making it small but still keep it look not pixelated and blurry. I first tried just making the sprites 20x20 but that made it super ugly.

Great at listening to what we wanted. One thing I still noticed hasn’t changed is the upgrade price. At level one hundred it would cost me 100 thousand gold to upgrade from a purple to pink. I’m already picking up pink and can craft it. It’s not like I’m crafting something I can’t. It makes it such a useless mechanic and it is in theory a great add on. Especially with the fact you get plenty of crafting material without having to farm on the slightest. I remember when the upgrade mechanic first dropped to go from brown to gold for something in the upper end of leveling, around 300, was like 15 million gold. These prices don’t equate to what you are receiving. I know nothing is going to be changed, but I have never used the upgrade deal and never will. Still a great game.

      "content": "I have manually created paths (tilemap layer) that have a navigation layer added to them based a tile's png 'shape'. I've been trying to have it so that enemies can pathfind on it, while player towers can be placed on the paths, which means the enemies need to try and find a path around the towers. Problem is that adding Nav Obstacles to towers and placing them doesn't seem to work. I've done a little research and it seems that Nav Obstacles don't work with tilemap layers. Is there anyway I could do this without having to add a navigation region to each path? Each path is made for one map so I'd rather not have to do anything that requires me to draw a path and then draw a navigation region afterwards... but tbh I'm clueless as to what else to do :/ Of course my enemies use NavigationAgent, I'm new to Godot so I'm not sure what the norm for pathfinding really is, I assume it's good XD submitted by /u/Physical_Metal6063 [link] [comments]",

I've played some single player games, but I completely lost interest in gaming recently, as new games feel more like movies with too long cutscenes and not actually experiencing the story through gameplay, and thus games feel dull to me. I've bought kindle 3 months ago, and feel like, I've used kindle more purposefully than desktop PC I've build year ago. I don't want to watch 10 mins cutscenes to have any idea what's happening in game , I could just watch Netflix. Does anyone relate ? I have this rtx3060 on 1080p (144hz) monitor, which I understand, people say is low (budget) end (intel i5-12400F , H610M-K D4, 32gb ram). Which I feel like GPU won't be used much because there's no new games that interest me at all. I always thought it would be great, but I just open chrome. In fact I could reinstall to chromeOS Flex, and I wouldn't feel the difference. I just notice it now (bc I never had PC to my ownership 😂). I feel like smartphone and laptop already killed desktop long time ago. Desktop is just a for gamers or work professionals.

      "content": "I've always thought about this, a goal that ties the game with 2 minutes left feels way more important than scoring the 6th goal in a blowout. But they count exactly the same in the stats. While on parental leave I started to vibe code this small site which weights points based on game situation. Everything was done during naptime, no kids were harmed :) https://clutchpuck.com Tying goals and go-ahead goals count more. Garbage time goals count less. Empty netters are basically worth little. Shorthanded goals get a bump etc. Adrian Kempe, Kevin Fiala and Tyler Bertuzzi rise the most on the standings. Biggest \"garbage time\" players are Glaude Giroux, Quinn Hughes, John Carlson. Cole Caufield rises +20 positions (from 29th to 9th). Curious if anyone else has thought about this or has further ideas on how the weights should work? You can also adjust the weights yourself if those seem too low or high. Clicking the player name will open up further information. https://preview.redd.it/3rsk1szwjzeg1.png?width=2590&format=png&auto=webp&s=871cba4dadf7e23080606bd79f4476864390cebf submitted by /u/valstu to r/hockey [link] [comments]",

      "content": "In the Fall of 2015, a buddy and I started taking our lunch break at his nearby apartment and developing a board game. It involved Reserving Champions and Promoting them into a Lineup to fight each other. Inspired from Pokemon TCG and Dominion, we called it BattleBox. After learning a lot about game design and balancing, eventually we took new jobs and moved on from Battlebox but about 1 year ago, I decided to bring it back to life. Now, 10 years later, on March 9th 2026, BattleBox will launch as Luxuriant for both MacOS and Windows on Steam. Link for those interested: https://store.steampowered.com/app/3887370/Luxuriant/ Would love wishlist if this is your style of game. submitted by /u/CStaplesLewis [link] [comments]",

So originally I was really excited about this i thought they were going to make this new game way advanced than Forest territory was and I was correct in that assumption when they released the game in early access they would eventually permanently shut down Forest territory and I was really sad about it but I ended up begging my parents for Robux so I could buy early access to the new game but eventually it released for free to everyone and it attracted more people because of the really good animations and models and I was also excited about this too more people would mean more ideas and people to roleplay with but it just was never the same as forest territory was now when I join this game nobody really does warrior cat roleplays anymore and before i could talk to people about the books almost everyone knew of them and had atleast read some of them but in this new game a lot of people don’t really. read the books. no one really talks to me there anymore either and I can’t really find anymore former forest territory players. that game was where i could go and talk about my love of warrior cats with other fans who loved and cared for both the books and the game it was where I would go when I was crying my eyes out and talking about warrior cats and roleplaying would make me feel better. This new game tho its just not really like that I used to play it a lot but eventually I just kinda stopped playing it because well it just didn’t do for me what forest territory did. To me forest territory wasn't just a Roblox game it was a whole community that taught me things when I was new and stuck by my side for as long as the game was open and now it’s gone if any former forest territory players see this it was an amazing experience while it lasted and I’m glad to have been apart of it. submitted by /u/Sorry-Warning1142 to r/WarriorCats [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Recently, as I'm sure 99% of you are aware, we received confirmation that LuaGuy has taken over the majority of ownership of Outcome Memories. While I personally don't know much about him, it seems that things, especially within the community, are beginning to look less bleak. I for one, am excited and hopeful, thanks to the non-stop encouragement and engagement Romeo has been giving our community. I think I speak for everyone when I say this, we are eternally grateful for the loyal members of the development team, be it Community Managers, coders, moderators, or what have you. We will continue to support this amazing project as long as you guys are committed to doing what you love. If anyone from the dev team or mod team is reading this, we're proud of you. We love and appreciate you. And you deserve this break. With all the recent drama, things seemed to be truly over. Chaos and doubt began to build within the community, but through Romeo, PR, and others, we were able to hold onto hope. As for now, as a whole, I think we the community need to take a step back from the devs and give them room to breathe, spread hope to those around us, and most importantly, continue showing the devs our support through posts akin to this, and playing the game. While I am sad that the game is on hiatus, and that the server is closed, it's time we come together in this moment to enjoy what we've already been given. Despite the jank and balancing and bugs, we still love this game, because we know what it can become. This is an ambitious project, and I believe in every single one of the developers, and all of us to show them that we want them to do their best, to flourish, and keep going, whenever they are ready.

I've got a moderately sized farm going, and I've been racking up essence of life over time by planting purely turnips as they're one of the best plants I can grow right now given the tier of my farmer's workbench. I was planning on then breaking down all those hundreds of turnips I've built up over the last few days into even more essence of life, so I could make some eternal seeds for other plants. I built up a bit over 2,200 EoL and it took a while, considering the length of one in-game day. I wanted to primarily grow wheat, and I didn't have enough wheat to make the amount of eternal seeds needed, so I decided to make some standard wheat seed bags to grow more. Issue is, I must've \"fat moused\" (if that's a term) and accidentally hit ALL, rather than making them in smaller, appropriate amounts. So, just like that, I lost every damn bit of my EoL that I built up, and I have a bunch of useless seed bags that I don't need. Is there a command I could use to give myself back 2,200 EoL or am I just kind of screwed here? I tried looking it up first but the command I'm seeing online isn't working for whatever reason.

      "content": "Been playing this game since 2016. The game just isn’t the same anymore. The ranking system makes no sense, and the punishments are ridiculous. My cat accidentally turned off my PC, it took me literally two minutes to get back into the game, and somehow I end up with a 15 minute penalty for five games? How does that make any sense? It honestly feels like Riot is pushing people away from ranked and forcing them into normal games instead. The community has become insanely sensitive, the new champions feel pointless, and everything is a mess. They add things like Atakhan just to remove them, add new boots and then remove those too which just proves those updates were useless from the start. I’ve been saying I’d quit since 2023, but after hitting Challenger, this was the final moment. I’m done with the game.

      "content": "Legacy of Valyria was working perfectly until I reinstalled the CK3 base game. Now the launcher says the mod is “missing descriptor file,” even though the descriptor file is definitely there when I open the mod folder manually. I’ve tried disabling/re-enabling the mod but no luck. I checked the .mod descriptor and the path is hard-coded to another Windows user. I never touched it before, but after reinstalling CK3 the launcher seems to reject it now. I’ve put over 100 hours into CK3 since getting my PC this Christmas, and the game honestly isn’t the same without LoV 😭 Any help would be hugely appreciated. submitted by /u/Psychological_Car475 to r/CK3AGOT [link] [comments]",

Hardcore: No Respawn! If you splash: game over! If you stop: you're done! Can you even finish the race? 4. Realism Mode: The view is forced to the cockpit. Plus there's only manual gear shifts. 5. Reverse Track: Check the tracks from a different perspective. Track Editor Animations I've added some cool block animations, it's more satisfying to create tracks.

It inspired me to put this debate into practice and challenge myself to beat the game with a strict set of rules, making team and move selection crucial, but still possible without relying on luck. I'm avoiding Nuzlockes or difficulty mods like Radical Red, because I want to figure out the best team for the original games. My planned rules are: Use only 6 Pokemon for the entire playthrough (MOs included). Set battle style. No in-battle items. To increase difficulty, I'm thinking of setting level caps for Gym Leaders and the Elite Four. My questions are: What level caps would hi that sweet spot (challenging but not luck-based)? Any other rules or ideas to make it harder? How should I hande IVs, EVs and natures? submitted by /u/Green-Grapefruit4713 to r/pokemon [link] [comments]",

I went through the go.dev tutorial completely and two competing statements jumped out at me: Go does not support classes Functions can have explicit receivers To play around just a bit, I decided to try making a Tic Tac Toe game just to get some practice. My first gut instinct was to write a Board class: package board ... type Board struct { rows [][]string } func (b *Board) Initialize() { ... } func (b *Board) Place(row, col, marker) { ... } func (b *Board) PrintBoard() { ... } ``` Is this a distinction without a difference? Is there a more idiomatic way to simulate classes in Go? Also, and perhaps more controversially, where do y'all stand with single-letter variable names?

Throughout the process, I was so focused on the elements of the monk (basic skin tone, strong face, bald like a Buddhist monk, monastic tattoos, monastic robes, and pose) that I didn't catch on what reference my mind had subliminally thinking of. Sure, I thought his face looked kinda familiar, but it was only at the end that I realized.... It's Kratos from the first GoW game... So I had to try out the monk in Kratos colours. submitted by /u/Tor8_88 to r/HeroForgeMinis [link] [comments]",

      "content": "I’m a 28yr old female in California, and I have been doing blue collar work all my career. I have never gotten a degree, but I’m interested in studying recreation because I love to craft, play games, and I have always found helping people to be fulfilling. However, I am very introverted and I think pretty socially awkward at times. I’m pretty nervous if this is a right move for me, but I’m desperate to get out working construction or anything else labor intensive like I’ve been doing. I also chose this major because I believe I have undiagnosed ADHD, and my previous college experience has been pretty flighty. I have switched my major from art to horticulture and now to recreation. It’s also hard to decide to switch because I was making $35 an hour in the labor union, and I don’t want to go to school to earn something lower than that. Any advice and insight from people who’ve worked the field or are experiencing something similar would be lovely. Sorry if this post feels like a cry for help, because it sort of is to be honest. :’) I tried to keep it brief! Thank you :) submitted by /u/Maeriellis to r/recreationaltherapy [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Hey all, I have been developing a Voxel RPG game in Godot for a little while now. So far, I always tested my multiplayer locally, since hosting a server had some port forwarding issues. very early in the project I did do the networking stuff together with a friend, and we were able to connect and play together. without any issues. At this point, the only RPCs that were done were syncing the players position and rotation. Now that I also have enemies and movable objects, the host is responsible for all physics calls, and the client only listens to those changes. Now, I moved to Steam networking (GodotSteam is great!), but when playing with the same friend, his experience is horrible since my character, enemies and other movable objects all lag behind quite a bit. Now, this worked fine when I tested it locally. So probably it is a bandwith issue. His character runs smoothly in my instance of the game. Now, I am doing a lot of RPCs every frame (250-600). For all the physics stuff, I am wondering, does it make sense to only send this every few frames? And/or, would it make more sense to bundle some RPCs (so send over an array of enemy positions and rotations, with an RPC, instead of doing a seperate RPC for every single enemy)? Do you have any other tips in optimizing the multiplayer experience? submitted by /u/DaanBogaard [link] [comments]",

There's been lots of talk about mergers/acquisitions. But what does GME acquire? Do they move further from video games and dig their heels in to trading cards? Or some other collectible market? Gaming continues to move towards digital. Do they try to go big on digital gaming, attempt to rival Steam in the digital game field? Is there some other emergent market that GME could try to be the first big mover on to capture as much market share as possible? Their dip into NFTs was obviously a huge bust, but they were able to get out of that business mostly unscathed. Sitting on the cash doing nothing is the worst thing to do with it just from a purely financial perspective. That's not to say they should be careless, obviously caution is extremely important here. But I believe if they knew what they were doing with the money, they would have done it already. So I don't think they know what they're doing yet either.

      "content": "Hi everyone. I’m currently a high school student and, honestly, pretty broke. I stay busy most days with school and a lot of sports outside of school, so I don’t have much free time. On most days, I only get around a couple of hours to really spend time with my partner. I wanted to ask about the game It Takes Two. I’ve heard it’s a really meaningful co-op experience, and it’s something I’d genuinely love to share with her. With how limited our time together can be, having something we can sit down and play together would mean a lot to me. She really loves games like Stardew Valley and plays them a lot, and I’d love the chance to have something we can experience together. It Takes Two includes a friend pass, which would allow us to play together, and that part really excites me. I think it would give us a way to feel more connected and make some good memories together. Thank you so much for reading this :) <3 submitted by /u/Own-Camp5181 to r/videogames [link] [comments]",

      "content": "About a month ago I shared a demo of my UE 5.7 SOG importer + Niagara Hybrid Gaussian Render pipeline. It takes unbundled SOG files and imports + converts them to UE usable textures, for sampling in shaders. It worked + looked great but since it was not a custom RHI, the performance did not scale well with large splat scenes. Last version was rendering 1M splat scenes at about 90FPS. This version runs 5M-10M splat scenes at 160-180 FPS . (havent tested larger scenes yet) The version now has: - Budget rendering for predicable frame rates ( a fixed size System is used for rendering so splat count is irrelevant ) - Deterministic slot assignment during Budget allocation ( necessary to combat atomic race issues in GPU stages) - Octree generation at import ( speeds up culling and LOD decisions) - HLOD (able to import up to 2 low res lod versions of the splat scene) - Per Splat LOD desicions ( decides whether or not to use full covariance calculation for unimportant, distant and small splats) Performance is still tied to Octree Node Count, so for larger splat scenes the leaf nodes just have more splats. Over draw can still be an issue when viewing dense regions up close. Biggest ball ache was actually dealing with the atomic race issues, which would lead to flickering during leaf node expansion after octree traversal. Theres a bunch of stuff thats also in there which I wont bore you with so yea... this is it. Stuff I still want/need to do : - smooth LOD transitions - reduce Texture size + lookups - LOD texture streaming - distance based budget allocation to deal with over draw in dense regions. submitted by /u/32bit_badman [link] [comments]",

At first I thought he seemed okay, but I've started noticing some red flags. He texts her constantly and gets upset if she doesn't respond immediately. Last week she missed a family dinner because he had some emergency that turned out to be nothing. She's also started pulling away from her longtime friends and seems anxious when her phone dies. When I try to talk to her about it, she gets defensive and says I don't understand their relationship. She insists he's just protective and really loves her. But yesterday I overheard him on the phone telling her that her friends don't really care about her and that he's the only one who gets her. I don't want to push her away or make her feel like she can't talk to me, but I'm worried this could e. She's always been pretty level-headed, but she seems like a completely different person lately.

So I go and look for a contract and I encounter this gem. 12k of iron and one single day to get the bonus. What psilocybin-fueled programmer thinks that this is possible? 12k of iron needs 14 ships for fulfillment, that means the 12 days you have for the contract is already tight if you only have one FCC. Yes, I know the game is not finished, but come on! No one thought about a ratio of volume vs time, when the contract system was coded? submitted by /u/ArtiSci to r/thecrustgame [link] [comments]",

It's not like I haven't talked to anyone, but I never felt that \"I want to be with you and we can be something together.\" Being in a relationship feels tedious; more than that, talking with someone every day feels tedious, caring about them feels tedious. Whenever I talk with anyone new, I feel like \"It will end anyway, hence it will not be worth it to talk.\" Am I doomed? I guess it is true, \"It destroys the ability to love and corrupts your mind. Making you a person without ambition and passion.\" What possibly would be the passion of my life? What ambition can I have?

I truly don’t know what else to do to fix this issue. My memory also seems to run just fine when playing video games like Stardew Valley.

How long until Isee a blatantly visible fill line? It excites me to no end. I have finished three so far (highlighted) and used these Project Pan polishes 16 (small blue dots) times so far, on myself and others. I want to see how many uses it takes to finish a bottle, and also track the use of my list this year. So many of these colours look great on me, and so they're still fun to use and create new looks out of with toppers, magnetics, by themselves, etc, so I don't feel like I'm missing out on the rest of my collection. This is just giving me more joy right now and I'm listening :) submitted by /u/bhumikapatel to r/WeGotPolishAtHome [link] [comments]",

I made this game because I wanted to make sure my game gives meaning, aside from being funny all the time, I wanted to remind the world of things buried in silence, history fading. Also reminding us to be vigilant. I honestly don't even know if you guys would like it but I loved testing and making it, especially the graphics which I coded from scratch into Unity.

Typically, i post early in the morning with a projected lineup, refs list and scratches, then fill in goals/penalties as they happen with a shot/hits/blocks counter. so what i'd like to know is: are the threads as curated too long, are there items you would rather see over something else, are you just sick of me posting the threads instead of a bot?

      "content": "I know some people don’t like when you compare the games, but that’s exactly what I’m going to do so😛Also this isn’t necessarily hate towards Sims 4, I have over 5000 hours on it and I love that game, but it does lack a lot of the soul and charm Sims 3 has. So I have 2 Simblr accounts, one where I post ts4 stuff and the other for ts3. They both follow similar formats- me reblogging cc I like, getting inspiration from other simmers, and most importantly posting my own gameplay and stories. I’m super active on my ts4 blog, posting edits, dialogue, gameplay, etc. But I haven’t been active on my ts3 blog in months. Is that because I find ts3 boring and not as fun as ts4? …No, actually the opposite. When I play my ts4 saves, I spend a lot of time taking screenshots, posing my sims, and getting the right angle. But when I play ts3, I feel so immersed in the gameplay that I simply don’t want to take screenshots and edit them/pose sims. I can play for 10 generations and not get bored because it will feel different and new each time. But in ts4, the thing that keeps me coming back to do more generations is knowing I can post pretty screenshots for tumblr. My favorite way to play sims is to do family/generational gameplay, and it just feels so much more fun in ts3. Sims 4 is pretty, but Sims 3 is fun. I don’t feel the need to get the perfect screenshot in ts3, I just enjoy playing. I’m always discovering something new about the game, and guess what, I only just started getting all the DLC! I’ve had this much fun already just with the base game and Seasons, so I’m sure I’ll have even more fun with the expansions. Even though I only have 500 hours on ts3 and 5000 in ts4, I like ts3 so much better. It also has that classic sims quirkiness that I feel like isn’t quite there in ts4. I love when my ts3 sims randomly scream (“wibna chogga dog!” anyone?), heckle each other, and fight just because they feel like it. And the biggest help? The freaking open world. Every time I want one of my sims to go out and do something in ts4, I get turned off because I know everyone else at home won’t get anything done and will still be awake with needs in the red even if my sim returns at 3am. It sucks and makes me not want to go out unless the whole family comes. But in ts3, my teen can go out and party while dad is at home watching tv, mom is cooking dinner, and the child sibling is doing homework. I don’t have to worry about their needs going to shit because they have basic survival instincts and will take care of them if they need to. I do plan on posting more on my ts3 blog, but for now I’m just enjoying the gameplay. I wish I started ts3 way sooner, it’s fucking awesome! submitted by /u/Zenphiree to r/HighSodiumSims [link] [comments]",

I don't notice it in game that much unless I rapidly move the map while a turn is processing. After a day of troubleshooting, I've determined it's isolated to just this game and especially during the cutscene. I could live with it, except for I still have my 3070 in my son's PC now and when I try to replicate the screen tearing I cannot, even with absolutely no variable refresh rate technology enabled. Wondering if anyone else has experienced this and if there's a solution? I'm wondering if maybe it's just a thing with some older games and newer AMD GPUs/drivers. Or if I should return and get a 5070 or some other nvidia card Specs: 7600x3D 32 GB DDR5 @6000 MHz ASRock 9070 XT Challenger 1440 @ 165 Hz I've tried: AMD premium freesync on and off Different monitors Making sure freesync is enabled on the monitor Different refresh rates: 360, 240, 144, 120, 60 Custom refresh rate of: 163 and also 147 DisplayPort and HDMI cables (both new) VRR enabled/disabled in windows display settings Thanks in advance.

I’ve never felt so successful while still feeling so young. On top of that, I love realizing that so many artists and singers I admire were my age when they were creating some of their best work. It feels like the perfect mix of youth and maturity. But now, 25 is slowly creeping in, and it’s making me extremely anxious about something that’s still more than a year away. What makes me most anxious is the feeling that I’m leaving the “young adult” age bracket (18–24) and that, from then on, I’ll be seen and treated the same way as someone who’s 30. Like… what do you mean yesterday I was 18, surviving the pandemic that stole my freshman year of college, upgrading my Fortnite battle pass and making TikTok edits, and now I’m in the same age bracket as TWENTY-FIVE-YEAR-OLDS? 💀 I’ve been very reflective these past few days, and I’ve come to the conclusion that I’m going through a third major transition in my adult life. I clearly remember when I was about to turn 18, ruminating over the fact that I was finishing high school and becoming legally an adult (in my country). Then I navigated the weird limbo of my late teens and was also scared to turn 20, which, surprisingly, was much less scary than turning 18. I simply accepted that my age now started with a 2, and it felt fresh and exciting. Jumping into my 20s and being the youngest in the “20s club” was fun as hell, even though COVID stole my 18 and 19. But now, turning 25 feels like a goddamn REQUIEM, like a final boss, the ultimate farewell to my youth. I’m already grieving something that isn’t even over. And that’s ironic, because I’ve always taken aging and acting my age very seriously. I just wanted to enjoy this status and this feeling for a few more years. Still, I know this is a transition. Turning 25 probably isn’t the end of the world. I can still hang out with people my age, play games, go clubbing, travel, and pay my bills at the end of the day… right? Does anyone else feel the same? Please tell me I’m not alone. 😭 submitted by /u/joaohunboi to r/OlderGenZ [link] [comments]",

It's the ability to see enemies through walls. If you've played any Farcry game before you would know what I'm talking about. Basically it would be a red outline or the color would match the enemy type like the illuminate being purple. This way you can plan attacks better and would be great for avoiding enemies when being stealthy. To balance the effects it would tag enemies in a radius that is half of your radar. This would also make the recon armor passive better. I really like the idea but it may be too good. submitted by /u/Unique_Ad1643 to r/Helldivers [link] [comments]",

However, I feel like people with this sentiment is missing one key point. And that is, what does the ARAM looks like when tanks are not OP? It means less people are excited/willing to pick tanks because its not fun. And that means more matches where your team does not pick tank. Tanks give you a frontline to play around with and they make space you to play. With no one playing tank, it just invites others much more non-interactive issues from other classes. Majority of my games no one hovers tanks in champion select, I don't want it to be all games. I'm not saying that some specific augments shouldn't get nerfed, but please consider that tanks can't just be alright nerfed. Also please do not say riot should just design tanks better, this is how tanks are in like every competitive multiplayer game. Tanks being in the game creates a positive gameplay experience but the role itself is hard to make appetizing without being strong. submitted by /u/ASDFCurry to r/ARAM [link] [comments]",

We’ve known each other for 2 1/2 years and were enough both attracted to each other, but neither of us initiated meeting up without others until recently. He only initiates texts to ask when I’m free for dinner/drinks and doesn’t make small talk in between so a whole week or two will go by before I hear from him unless i initiate and text him. We’re only able to meet up once every two weeks due to schedules. The first time this happened he was on vacation so I figured he just likes to be away from his phone while on vacation. But now it’s been a whole week since our second date and I still haven’t heard from him and I haven’t initiated either and want to pull back and see what he does. -1st date happens -Few days later he goes on a weeklong vacation. -He comes back and texts me two days after coming back asking for second date. -Another week goes by before we actually meet for second date. He doesn’t ever text first. I do. Responses are long and thought out. -Second date happens. -I text day after second date and he responds thoughtfully. -It’s been a 5 days and haven’t heard from him since. -He’s not gonna ghost me because I usually run into him every few months, but I have a feeling he’ll probably text in a few days. Has anyone been with somebody who was genuinely interested in them but only texts one time a week? I’m not used to such infrequent communication, especially in the beginning of getting to know each other. He doesn’t use social media so he probably isn’t on his phone all the time, but I have seen him use his phone to check the weather and the news and sports scores and he uses YouTube a lot. I’m anxiously attached so my nervous system is definitely triggered, but I don’t know if this is his communication style with everyone, or he’s just not all that interested submitted by /u/chocolattecheesy to r/relationship_advice [link] [comments]",

      "content": "For 1m+ there has been a game breaking bug in Franchise mode where every QB will regress every year, hard, no matter what. Including rookies. This makes it impossible to develop a QB effectively - the single most important thing for any team. After 3-4 years results in only 2-3 90+ QBs in league. It breaks immersion and ruins the experience. There have been a few yt'ers like C4 who covered this within last few weeks and I'm truly stunned there has not been a single statement or update from EA on this bug. They had a major title release on 17th with no mention in patch notes. The bug had been live for weeks. We all know how awful Franchise has been for 15+ years but this is by far the worst bug I have seen persist for the feature in Madden history. Its playoff time when I suspect many other Franchise heads are hyped to play the game, but it is truly unplayable in this state. Worse still, is the fact that EA has not even acknowledged this in any way. Its the bare minimum customer service - if you can't fix the issue at least let us know you are working on it. Please upvote/comment to help spread awareness so franchise fans can some response from EA. submitted by /u/Mark-A-G to r/Madden [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Feels weird. Feels good? I had this mental pressure around all these things I still needed to add, but now the list is gone. My modest goal was to make a game that I enjoyed and that maybe 5 strangers would also like. It's a text-based life sim. Started as a bitlife clone that was going to be \"bitlife but deeper.\" But about 2 months ago, I stumbled on a different theme (set in a fictional authoritarian state where your choices could affect your unborn grandchildren), and I'm pretty excited about it. Started writing in Python, then had to switch it over to Unity (because I learned late that I couldn't easily use CustomTKinter UI for a web-based game on itch). Did it part-time around work hours (not working full-time right now, not sure I could have done this if I was). Leaned on LLM as a sort of 24/7 endlessly patient tutor and learned a lot as I went. I had some basic programming knowledge already and had made a few very small 'games' before. Also did Unity's Create with Code course back when I was furloughed in 2020. I'm very much a hobbyist, not pretending otherwise. I wanted to expand my skills and knowledge with this project, and make a game I wanted to play. I believe I succeeded in both those goals. Game will release as a free web-based game, hopefully in a few months. Posting here just to share this with people who might understand how good it feels to finally get there. submitted by /u/Beginning-Search-983 [link] [comments]",

I already have a mechanic where you can plant and grow crops, and the next step is making them harvestable. The problem is that I’m not sure what the best system would be. One idea is to use crates/boxes to collect the crops, and only allow selling them once the box is full. Another option is to add a small hotbar (like 2–3 slots) where the crops go when you harvest them. In both cases, I would add upgrades to these systems so the player can carry more items over time. However, I’m also planning to add automation systems later on, with machines/robots, conveyor belts, etc. So now I feel like I need to make a decision before continuing development 😅 Does anyone know which version works better in practice?

They were drawn in a coffee shop while we were still shaping the story, together with our narrative designer and me. At the time, they were just rough ideas on paper. Looking at them now, they feel like a really funny and oddly dear memory (I hope I don't have to add an NSFW tag because of the boobies lol). Seeing how far the visuals have come since then is genuinely heartwarming for us. I just wanted to share this little time jump and say thank you to everyone who’s been around during the process.

      "content": "Anyone who’s tried routing Warzone audio through a capture card on PlayStation has probably hit this wall. The moment you connect a second controller or user, game chat suddenly goes silent. Party chat might still work, system sounds are fine, but in game voice just disappears. This usually isn’t a Warzone bug by itself. It’s how PlayStation handles audio ownership. When a second controller signs in, the console often assigns voice chat to the primary active user or defaults it to the controller headset instead of HDMI or USB. Warzone is especially picky about this and doesn’t always switch back cleanly. What I’ve seen work most consistently is keeping the second controller signed in as a guest and muted, then manually setting audio output to HDMI in system settings before launching Warzone. Inside Warzone, double check voice chat device and make sure crossplay chat is enabled. If you’re using a capture card, disabling controller headsets entirely can also force chat back to HDMI. If it were my setup, I’d avoid the second controller workaround altogether and use a USB audio splitter or software routing on the PC side. It’s less fragile and survives updates better. Curious what setups you all are using. Capture card, party chat, Discord, something else? And did any weird fix work for you that shouldn’t have? submitted by /u/edward_dd to r/PlayStation_X [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Some people think it might be Person A vs Person B because a lot of their friends are coming, or because they’re well known - but that doesn’t necessarily matter in The 50. To sum it up, in the intl versions, even if ur friends came, they make u betray them 😭😭😭 Some of these big contestants friends may literally only be brought on to see if the big contestants have the ability to do ANYTHING to win the game. You might think someone’s support system makes them stronger, but in reality? It just gives the game more leverage. That alliance you’re banking on? That history? It’s fodder. Drama fuel. And you bet the game will make you choose between your goal and your relationships. The tasks don’t only have physical tasks, there’s a lot of mental/manipulative/mind game tasks. This isn’t Big Brother. This is a game built to break alliances. In the international versions of The 50, the presence of your best friend, your ride-or-die, your emotional support human… doesn’t protect you. In fact, the format weaponizes it. Players who tried to stay loyal often ended up being sacrificed by the game itself, twists, betrayals, forced eliminations. The rules shift just when you think you’ve figured them out. Example: In some versions, some “alliances” literally ended in people choosing to eliminate their own friends to secure their place. In The 50 (France), betrayal was practically the currency of strategy. Friends turned on friends. Not out of malice, but because the game made it the only path forward. The structure itself rewards the cold move, not the kind one. So while fandoms online are speculating that a player is safe or has a built-in army because they know 2-3 others on the cast… the show doesn’t work that way. Even mid-episode , the rules can change. The Fox (a literal costumed assistant of The Lion) might step in and say: “Congrats, you’re safe… but now choose someone to send home.” That someone could be your closest ally. The Lion Doesn’t Care About Your Friendships The host isn’t your friend either. In fact, in most versions, The Lion is a masked, anonymous, antagonist, and manipulative figure who controls the entire house with cryptic messages, rule shifts, and social torture disguised as “twists.” They don’t guide the contestants, they manipulate them. They’ve had seasons where: • Friends were put in direct combat to stay. • Assistants infiltrated groups to spread false info or gather info for the lion. • Eliminated contestants came back… knowing exactly who voted them out. Play For Yourself: That’s The Only Rule This is not the kind of show where popularity saves you. It doesn’t matter how many people shipped your friendship before the show. You could walk in with 3 best friends and leave by episode 2 if they decide you’re the weakest link, or the biggest threat. Strategy > Sympathy. Mind games > Loyalty. Self-preservation > Everything. So yeah, your faves might come in with backup. But The 50 is a test of how far you’ll go, how much you’ll sacrifice, and whether you’re ready to burn everything, including your allies, to survive. submitted by /u/kameueda to r/The50IN [link] [comments]",

      "title": "[Dating Advice] 3 playful texts that actually lead to a date (feat. Matthew Hussey’s secret sauce)",
      "content": "Everyone’s texting but no one’s dating. You match, you vibe, you talk... then it dies. Ghosted. Or worse, things drag on with zero real-world plans. If you’re feeling like your convos go nowhere, you’re not alone. A ton of people get stuck in the “talking stage” and never graduate to an actual date. Let’s fix that. This post is based on insights from Matthew Hussey’s Get The Guy , plus research from behavioral psychology and texting studies on attraction. What you're about to see actually works because it's playful, low-pressure, and makes people want to meet you. Unlike the boring “wyd” or forced flirty lines that flood TikTok. Let’s break down 3 playful, low-key texts that almost always lead to a date (when there’s mutual attraction). “Stop… you just gave me an idea.” This opener creates curiosity without being cliché or cringey. You follow it with something like, “We should do a coffee taste test and settle the iced vs. hot debate once and for all,” or “Mildly tempted to challenge you to a museum art-off… loser buys gelato.” According to Hussey, playful banter that subtly frames a date as a shared adventure makes it more appealing. It’s not about asking , it’s about imagining together. Harvard psychologist Dan Gilbert’s research on prediction and happiness (“Stumbling on Happiness”) shows we’re more likely to say yes to things that feel novel and lighthearted. “Ok so do you get into debates during brunch or are you normal?” This one’s gold. You’re teasing them playfully while implying a brunch date. It plays into what Hussey calls “assumptive flirting” you pretend the date is already happening. Studies by Dr. Arthur Aron (Stony Brook University) show that shared imagination and humor spike dopamine and connection even before people meet. Sneak that date idea in, don’t pitch it like a job interview. “Not to be dramatic, but I just found our new go-to spot.” You send this with a location (café, ramen place, bookstore bar whatever fits your vibe). Why it works: it’s bold and casual. You’re not begging for time, you’re offering a shared experience. Behavioral economist Dan Ariely talks about the “default bias”when you present something as a given, people are more willing to go along with it. You’re not saying, “Do you want to go?” You’re saying, “This should be ours.” These lines aren’t magic spells. They work best when you’ve already got a little spark . But most people mess up by texting safe, boring stuff. These texts invite curiosity, play, and shared imagination which are the real drivers of attraction, according to multiple studies in The Journal of Social and Personal Relationships . Text smarter, not harder. submitted by /u/nambi2002 to r/MensDiscipline [link] [comments]",

Blood Wings/claws signifying some form of corrupted life has reanimated him, skeletal/undead body, engraved runes marking his bones showing some forbidden or dark ritual, and green fel energy flowing through the runes and his eyes (inspired by world of warcraft).

There are no error messages or warnings to indicate what caused the crash. Both clients are experiencing the exact same issue. Steps I’ve already taken to fix it: Ran the applications as Administrator. Reinstalled the base game (BO3). Reinstalled both the boiii and t7x client files.

      "content": "Ever notice how DLC problems almost always show up right when you’re ready to play? You buy it, it downloads, the store says installed, and the game acts like it doesn’t exist. I’ve seen this exact situation way too many times. Most people assume it’s a download glitch, but more often than not it’s a region mismatch. If the base game is a physical disc, its region has to match the region of the PlayStation account used to buy the DLC. If they don’t match, the console will happily take your money and install something the game will never recognize. Before panicking, I always check a few things. Press Options on the game tile and open Manage Content. If the DLC shows up there but says usable, it’s installed correctly. If it doesn’t show at all, that’s a red flag. Rebuilding the database or restoring licenses can help sometimes, but if the transaction is still pending, it may just be stuck in limbo. Personally, if I’m using a physical copy, I make sure the disc region and my PSN account line up before buying anything extra. Saves a lot of stress. If you’ve run into this, was it a region issue for you or did Sony support actually fix it?

In regard to the Steam tags, we are of corse using Card Battles, Deck Building, Rome, but would you use the Political Sim tag? The card battle simulates a debate in the Roman Senate, but in this tag I would expect something very different from what the game is and will be. Also worth mentioning, for now it only shows the core of the game (senate debate/card battle), however it will include a whole map of Rome with events & decisions you build your deck.

      "content": "I moved in 2021 and left behind a group of about 3 friends that I’d been close with since 2013. Ever since then I have people I’m close with that I live with between family and my partner. And I’m thankful for that. I had one friend from high school that moved across the country and we still played games and discord called all the time but about 2 years ago we fought and he cut off contact. In terms of non coworker, platonic friendships I have 0. And I’m not necessarily upset about it most of the time because I don’t have to keep up with seeing anyone and can spend my days off for the most part the way I want to. But at the same time it sucks and I don’t have many people to go to and while I’m grateful to have at least some people to talk to I know I annoy them with my tv shows music and whatnot that they’re not into. I usually end up with most of my socializing being done with randoms on Reddit and Xbox public matches. All good if it’s just me I’ll take the L but was wondering if others are going through it too and what your suggestions are. I was making a little progress on making friends in discord but it just doesn’t hit the same as when you know them irl or at least knew that at one point irl. submitted by /u/TrashInspector69 to r/Zillennials [link] [comments]",

If a storm starts, it will move very actively, if the game is calm, there will only be slight swaying. This is only the first iteration, it will continue to improve.

The playtest is open and unlimited 2. Very little marketing done (announced in the discord and posted a single instagram and youtube shorts reel) 3. Game is multiplayer (coop) and requires at least 2 players, or up to 10, so likely going to have an incredibly high drop off of people joining, launching and then quitting 4. I have friend invites enabled 5. Running for 2 weeks only, not sure if this is standard practice I'm not sure how much is botted, or if that's even a thing with playtests the way it is with demos. I've hardly marketed the game or playtest so am just surprised, friend invites being sent and accepted to me means it can't all be bots. Interested to hear thoughts from folks who've run public playtests for their indie titles before. submitted by /u/itsamayo [link] [comments]",

I've implemented a day/night cycle with a dynamic lighting system that changes the atmosphere throughout the day. There's now a working loot system with chest interactions, and I've populated the environment with new sprites like trees, bushes, and decorative elements. I'm having a blast working on this project every small addition makes the world feel more alive and keeps me motivated to push forward. The lighting combined with the time cycle especially creates amazing atmosphere. Still learning Godot as I go, but the engine has been incredibly approachable.

She's a huge basketball fan, used to play it when she was younger before switching to volleyball. So she's pretty sporty. There's this player in the NBA that she used to go to middle school with and partially high school as well. She follows his career closely and a huge fan. She watches most of his games. Watches all his highlights on youtube. And she talks about him constantly. Always bringing up how he's always been \"him\" since childhood. She also follows him on social media. I see her liking his posts and leaving heart emojis. It feels like she is crushing on him and it's pissing me off. It's bad enough her fangirl shit already seems a bit over the top, but it's just the fact she actually knew him as well. And lord knows if they still keep in contact or not. Which she denies. Makes me paranoid. Obviously I've confronted her about it, told her it feels like she's crushing on dude and I don't like it. But she's accussing me of being insecure for nothing. She's allowed to support one of their \"hometown heroes\". And that I wouldn't get it, I'm not from her hometown and don't understand how loyalty runs deep with their people. I mean, yeah... i get it. I'm not from some crazy sports town on the eastcoast, regardless I think her behavior is inappropriate. We've gotten into a few arguments now over this.

The player will find clues about a supernatural horror as they are reading text files and looking at a log file (accessible anywhere). There are sound effects simulating this old computer. I wonder what horrir elements I can add in this very barebones GUI? There are some tasks where the player needs to look into the log file to retrace their steps, and seeing log rows of another, unexpected user doing things on the computer is one thing I will explore.

      "content": "Basically, almost every prop in my environment needs to be simulating physics and be interactable (through an interface). There are 2 ways to go about this: spawn each prop as a separate actor or spawn them as static mesh components attached to the same one actor.

I also don't know the drawbacks of having an actor with dozens, or even hundreds, of static mesh components.

When the material is created, the standart option BACK is selected, but some body parts act like the FRONT option is selected instead. And it goes further: when i select the FRONT option, the bugged body part shows like the BACK options is selected. like it is inverted. To fix this you just have to disable the Cull Mode option. just like this And the model is fixed. submitted by /u/boombatis [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Hello everyone. I just released a mod called Hazardous Glowing Sea on Nexus Mods, which adds more creature spawns to the Glowing Sea region of Fallout 4. I encountered a couple other mods which do something similar, but I found them to be either a bit too much or not quite enough for my taste. So I made one that hopefully makes the Glowing Sea feel like more of a risk at virtually any level, without completely overwhelming the experience. Though, you can be overwhelmed. Think swarms and proliferation. More radroaches, bloodbugs, stingwings, bloatflies, and ghouls. I imagined they'd thrive in larger numbers rivaled only by other species. Some creatures level with you. Other stronger variants don't. Most use leveled lists so that spawns aren't exactly alike each time. There are a few unique variants of ghouls and behemoths as well and some I'll leave you to discover. Give it a shot and let me know what you think. Danger isn't everywhere you go, but you can be ambushed at any point, so bring plenty of stimpaks, radaway, and heavy artillery.

From soft locks while dungeoning, weapons disappearing so you can’t attack, crafting issues that result in crashing, visual bugs and glitches… the DLC is a mess at the moment. I’m scared to even push forward because my game crashes or bugs out so often, and I lose 10 to 15 min. of progression each time. Have the devs committed to a timeframe yet on when this all will be reviewed and fixed?

      "content": "Our team at Deep Matrix is thrilled to release Dixotomia in full access on Steam and Meta. The development took us more than 4 years. The last 2 years were especially busy, as our team grew to up to 12 people at some point in development. This VR shooter, where you fight vampires with sci-fi tech and dark powers, has been a labor of passion. When we launched our game into Early Access at the end of August, we were full of hope. But the reception was a wake-up call. Many players rightly pointed out that the game wasn’t where it needed to be in terms of polish, balance, or content. It was disappointing to realize we’d missed the mark. But instead of backing down, we got to work. We’ve spent the past 5 months addressing every issue, implementing major overhauls, and reworking core systems based on player feedback. We’re proud to say the game has improved dramatically, and we’ve finally made the game we believe is truly worthy of a full release. Dive into the story on the planet Karna and choose your path. https://store.steampowered.com/app/1367710/Dixotomia/ submitted by /u/DeepMatrixVR [link] [comments]",

      "title": "[Solo Dev] Bloody Fate – A Story-Driven Mafia Revenge Game Set in Sicily",
      "content": "Hello everyone, I’d like to share a project I’ve been developing completely on my own. The game is called Bloody Fate. Bloody Fate is a single-player, story-driven action shooter set in Sicily. It is not an open-world game — the focus is on narrative, atmosphere, and character-driven progression. The story follows Leo, a man who arrives in Sicily after the death of his father. Hoping to leave his past behind, he opens a small grocery store and tries to start a quiet new life. However, the region’s criminal networks soon pull him into a world he never wanted to be part of. Every decision he makes to survive pushes him deeper into an irreversible path within the mafia underworld. The game features: First-person and third-person perspectives Narrative-driven missions and dialogue Cinematic, mission-based combat A dark, serious mafia and revenge theme I’m developing this project entirely solo, handling programming, design, and story myself. My goal isn’t scale, but to deliver a focused, memorable story with a strong atmosphere. Feedback, thoughts, and criticism are more than welcome. Thanks for taking the time to check it out. Wishlist on Steam If Bloody Fate caught your interest, you can support the project by adding it to your Steam Wishlist. Every wishlist really helps a solo developer and makes a huge difference submitted by /u/Particular_Mine_4189 [link] [comments]",
