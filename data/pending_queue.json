      "content": "Hello everyone, Very pleased to announce that the game will be available at the Steam Next Fest! Some of you might remember I posted it here a while back to overwhelmingly positive feedback: r/pcgaming/Announcing Ludus Magnatus Gladiator Manager Simulator Not only was it extremely motivating to see that people overall seemed excited about it, as I'll be honest and say that I had no idea as to what to expect, as this was the first time I was putting it out there to a larger audience. As a solo developer, as with any kind of solo project/work/task, I think we can all recognise that sometimes you can go a bit \"blind\" on something. So I am also pleased to confirm that almost all the feedback that was provided in that former thread has been addressed and added to the game, these include, but are not limited to: -14 new traits has been added to make your Gladiators feel more unique -\"Heavy Training\" has now been added to the game, allowing you to train Gladiators to prepare them better, before entering the Arena -League Screen has gotten it's own panel -Home panel has been completely redesigned -AI improvements -Player team now always shows as \"blue\" even when being the away team -Stats now have a different colour when reaching their cap -Doctores has been renamed to Medicus as that's more appropiate -Buildings has been added in the background of the Arena for immersion -More armours -Tons of UI improvements, bug fixes and overall improvements as well :) Hope if you read through this that you will give the game a chance at the Steam Next Fest which starts the 23rd of February. submitted by /u/Rungsted93 to r/pcgaming [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Ok I have to talk about this even thought I haven't used Reddit in years now. Doughboy Ms p campaign might have just shown how piggy is going into bad direction even while receiving new content. Started with daily skins and then it was advent calendar where you could just skip the time or avoid spending tokens using robux, piggy is kind of game that never used robux to skip progress aside from purchasing tokens, but these aren't hard to get, but this update might have took it too far with how you have to grind new currency even though it's our reward for buying the plushie ad so supporting the game, you mean to tell me that wasn't enough for them? Last time the rewards were free and it was all ok so why this change? Next up might be complete event gamepass who knows, I know the devs need money but in that case that was the campaign purpose and piggy has very loyal community. Minitoon, please speak to wizard watch studios about this, because I doubt this was actually your idea, let the game feel free to play and kind towards us like it was always been and vice versa.

      "title": "We Had Fun, So Our DM Got Mad About It",
      "content": "So my group is pretty new to D&D, like one year of actual play. Our first session was run by a friend of a friend who noped out immediately afterward, so one of the players became our Forever DM by default. He ran some one-shots and then a weekly Roll20 campaign. Cool. I dropped out because I couldn't commit to weekly online sessions because of work, and I also didn’t want to download Discord (yes, I'm stubborn). DM kept saying I could \"drop in anytime\", which SOUNDS nice but is basically impossible when everything happens on an app you refuse to install. Months go by. In October he finally messages me because they're about to fight a big boss and want to make it a thing. He does a mini Session Zero with me on Zoom to catches me up, helps me build a Monk that's basically Sonic the Hedgehog with fists. He even gave me extra actions and reactiond because my stats were \"so high,\" which should've been a red flag but I was too excited punching ghosts in the future to care. Game night arrives. I'm late, but everyone's just standing around because one player's kid got sick and the DM is trying to get him connected via Discord or Zoom or something remotely like he's NASA. Eventually we start this boss fight in an armoury. It. Is. A. Brick. Wall. The boss has crazy armour, so only our DPS can scratch it. The rest of us spend the whole TWO HOURS doing the world’s saddest loop: roll, hit, \"no damage\". My monk did manage to keep the thing prone the whole fight, so at least nobody got hurt except the DM's pet NPC (who apparently from one of the other players' backstories). He died dramatically in a player's arms. Cool moment for one player, I guess. Honestly? We still had fun, not in some \"wow amazing D&D experience\" way, just… a good night. One guy had the Jays game up on his phone and kept half-paying attention to score, calling out innings whenever something happened (they won that night, but spoiler alert, pulled a the typical Toronto choke for the series). Someone else was talking about how he's about to have a kid and suddenly that turned into five dads arguing about sleep schedules. DM ordered pizza at some point, I don’t even remember when, and brought out a bottle of scotch he’d been saving, which probably explains why nobody cared that the fight was dragging. It felt less like a \"session\" and more like hanging out, and I was into that.bApparently the DM was not. A few days later he starts privately messaging EVERY SINGLE PLAYER like he's running HR for the World's Smallest Company. He said he was upset because: someone called him a cheater (not me) someone called him \"dad\" sarcastically when he shushed them (also not me) we shouldn't be looking behind his DM screen (I was just curious) we weren't being \"creative\" enough we were \"treating the game like a video game\" we didn't take the session \"seriously\" and we needed a group meeting to \"align on what game we're playing\" Dude basically rage-quit fun. The twist? One player actually DID quit the weekly campaign after this because he doesn't like heavy roleplay and thought the DM was trying to force it. So yeah. We went to his house, ate pizza, drank booze, listened to the world series, punched a boss for zero damage, had a blast — and because we enjoyed ourselves the \"wrong way,\" the DM got mad. He wanted a Very Serious Cinematic Drama and accidentally invited a bunch of dudes who just wanted a good Friday night. submitted by /u/PM_ME_CUTE_ASlANS to r/dndhorrorstories [link] [comments]",

Yet they stated that they're disabling this feature? Stitching the two sides back together like in the picture would allow a proper naval front to develop with a midline of island hexes from Godcrofts to Stema Landing and the eventual target of landing on and overrunning the enemy's large island. A big gripe that I'm hearing from naval clans about this announcement is that they're forced to choose between the lane that can invade the enemy's large island or the lane that can only defend their own faction's large island. It just feels like a huge missed opportunity turning what could be a dynamic ocean lane into two linear ones. submitted by /u/Cakey642 to r/foxholegame [link] [comments]",

We'd like to open up the Kitchen and large Living Room so they feel more connected when spending time in those areas. If we used the current combined area marked \"Kitchen, Living Room\" as our primary living space, it wouldn't be large enough to host gatherings, and then we're kind of wasting the large \"Living Room\" space on the left. Our idea is to basically remove the walls on either side of the Dining Room. It will also require moving the oven from the Dining Room wall along the back wall, and then perhaps enlarging the island. I think we'd then plan to keep a dining table where it is, there just wouldn't be wall boundaries on either side. Does this make sense? It still seems like we're not optimizing the space since now we also have the smaller \"Living Room\" area that isn't really used, but maybe this is the best we can do without major renovations like relocating the entire kitchen. I'd also really love to fit an office somewhere, but it's not necessary. Thanks! submitted by /u/dmeixner to r/floorplan [link] [comments]",

We are a tiny team of two otome game lovers working on our very own otoge called Somnium: The Whale’s Dream , and we wanted to share our project and invite anyone who’s curious to join us as we navigate the waves of game development. 😊 We are learning as we go, and we really value community interaction and feedback as we continue creating the game! For this reason, we recently started a Patreon page where we share literally everything and you can join us for free. 🩵 To give you a little taste of our aesthetics and vibe ✨, here is our logo and banner as well as a character teaser we recently published. https://preview.redd.it/ngpmmji9nydg1.jpg?width=2643&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a0b50b5388033328a60146c6a597a0e539ad4fed https://preview.redd.it/nlhp7lz5oydg1.png?width=1736&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c902fe69051be308a00a434dd0d80e509f4135f This character has since then been revealed, so if you are curious to know more and want to keep up with the character or the game’s development please join us on Patreon. Our goal is to build this game with people who love otome games as much as we do, not just quietly behind closed doors. If you have questions, thoughts, or just want to say hi, we’d love to chat in the comments. Thank you for taking a look and for supporting indie devs! 🩵🫶 submitted by /u/tiny_waves_studio to r/IndieOtome [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Some things have definitely changed (strategems most notably moving from a shared board to individuals ones, other biomes, new enemies, etc) but this still gives a pretty solid overview. I was most intrigued by the Limited Table Space rule and the possibility of endless exploring/infinite play space, both of which I hadn't heard about. Limited Table Space (timestamp 13:00): This says you must have space for at least 4 - 8\" X 8\" (200mm X 200mm) map tiles for your game but you can put out as many above that as you can. This is possible because as you explore you can take map tiles off the table that no Helldivers are on (or if they are on they die) to make room to add others. This mechanic also allows for... Endless Exploring/Infinite Play Space (timestamp 13:58): Since the battlefield isn't limited to a set number or specific tiles you can potentially keep exploring down an endless corridor of map tiles if you wanted to! This is a unique mechanic that I think can make for some interesting situations. And since map tiles are shuffled and recycled it really will randomize the events/POIs/etc you find if you choose to go this route. submitted by /u/MelArlo to r/TableTopHelldivers [link] [comments]",

I hate the obvious favoritism one of the devs has for her with a literal tattoo of her. I hate that she makes no sense in the canon, shoehorned in as a childhood friend of the Shimadas even tho they’re pushing 40 and she’s supposedly in her early 20’s. I hate how she feels like someone’s OC. I hate how they made her kind of likable in her cinematic then made her annoying as shit in-game. The only thing I like about this chud is that she’s fun to play and she’s good in-game. But it also pisses me of that she’s one of the best, if not THE best support, because that means I have to be subjected to her annoying ass even more, and I HATE THAT I ENJOY PLAYING HER. submitted by /u/dessnee to r/hatethissmug [link] [comments]",

Since I have no programming knowledge, can I take the Junior Programmer Pathway or should I first study the basics of programming logic to at least understand the purpose of terms like iF, get, and other keywords?

Whenever I try to join a game using a code, the game simply loads until this screen and never connects. I’ve already: Changed network settings Tested on different internet connections Tried different networks entirely So far, nothing has worked. What makes this more confusing is that it seems to be OS-related : If I host a server on macOS , no one is able to join. If a friend on Windows hosts , everyone (except me) can join almost instantly. Because of this, I strongly suspect the problem is related to macOS ↔ Windows compatibility , or possibly how hosting/networking is handled on macOS specifically. Has anyone else on macOS experienced this? Any known fixes, required ports, or official acknowledgment of this issue? submitted by /u/Vetor_ to r/HytaleInfo [link] [comments]",

      "content": "I don’t hate these movies at all. In fact, I enjoyed them, as did most people. But there’s just something about a superhero origin story that can’t be beaten, especially when it features characters who haven’t had a good origin movie in a while. I like to see the contrast of the hero before and after they get their costumes and powers. It’s emotionally fulfilling to see them go from a powerless but well-meaning nobody, who wishes they could do something to make a difference in the world, eventually go through the trials and tribulations that turns them into that super-powered someone who can finally make a change they want to see. In the 2025 movies, we never see who the baseline “Clark Kent” was without his powers and costume except for some vague flashbacks. In First Steps, we hardly get to know what Reed, Sue, Ben, and Johnny are like before the space incident, other than “they’re a family of famous astronauts.” What makes them tick? How do they view the world and everyone in it? How do they respond to problems if “superpowers and influence” aren’t an option? These types of questions are important if you want the audience to have a strong emotional attachment to these characters. I know, people are getting sick of superhero origin stories, and Superman’s origin and the Fantastic Four’s origin are already well-known to most people. But the “Hero’s Journey” is such a timeless story concept that I’m sure there could’ve been a way to make it feel fresh, or at least nostalgic to moviegoers. submitted by /u/Sectumsempra845 to r/unpopularopinion [link] [comments]",

During the weekdays I'm working as a software engineer, in the weekends and evenings I try to relax and do fun stuff. Some of my interests: Music Mostly scouting for records in the record shops, listening and enjoying new music and visiting concerts. Genres I like are psychedelic rock, punk, some metal, some rap and anything progressive. The last record I've bought is from Jehtro Tull and the last concert I've been to was Psychedelic Porn Crumpets. Sports Mostly watching sports (football) but I also enjoy the occasional swim and I've been trying to go to the gym more often. Gaming PC is my platform. Been playing alot of Counter-Strike for the last 15 years, but I love most kind of games. Long conversations That's the thing that makes me the most happy I think. Long, maybe deep, conversations on any topic with a good friend, count me in! I won't give everything about my life away, but this is some of it. Anything that interests you or just want to start a conversation? Let's do it! You can be from anywhere, any age, any gender. If you're closeby I'll take you for a lunch and a beer (or non-alcoholic drink if you prefer) sometime soon. submitted by /u/SomeWinters to r/MakeNewFriendsHere [link] [comments]",

It’s a cozy, browser based lite MMO where you can brew potions, grow ingredients, and team up with other players to take down big, ridiculous bosses. No downloads, no grind, no pressure. Just open your browser and play. I’m a dad from Sydney who’s been building games and systems for years, and this one is fully self funded and made in the scraps of time that exist around parenting and life. My 11-year-old daughter is creating the artwork for the game as she learns digital art, and I’m handling the code, design, and everything under the hood. Some visuals are still placeholders while she works through each asset, but every final piece of art you see in the game is hers. I built Little Potion Garden because I love MMOs, but I don’t have the time to live inside one anymore. I wanted something lightweight, social, and genuinely fun to jump into whenever I get a moment. A game that feels welcoming instead of overwhelming. A world that grows over time, not one that demands your entire schedule. If you’re into cozy games, browser MMOs, or just want a place to relax and brew something magical, I think you’ll enjoy what we’re building here. The game updates every week, the art keeps improving as my daughter adds more of her work, and the world is slowly becoming exactly what we imagined.

      "content": "My(31F) partner(44M) is very close with his daughter(19F). I long ago suspected emotional incest but he assured me he never confides in her or looks to her for mood stability. However, I strongly believe she feels like it is a responsibility of hers. She feels like it is her job to make her dad happy, and she constantly asks for alone time/trips. She follows him around the house like a puppy dog (even into the bathroom) where he has to stare at her like, are you gonna leave? She cannot function without him. She describes her body to him, asks inappropriate questions about his genitals. She’ll even lay on the floor right in front of him and shake her butt. He says he doesn’t establish boundaries bc it’s a free for all at their mamas. Basically, he doesn’t want to be a prude bc their mom is so open. He wants to be the fun parent…to the point that both of his kids have zero responsibility in our home and literally get whatever they ask for. It’s their way or the highway. Anyway, I just feel like the signs are there for both of them. There’s an immense codependency. She just went back to college after a month long break and he’s been anxious and moody since she left. He’s been snappy at me and distant. She calls every hour of the day, when she visits from college she can’t be away from him. She can’t even stay the night at her mom’s house and when her mom invites her to dinner, she invites my partner to go too! And she loves her mom. Has the greatest relationship with her, but cannot be away from dad. Idk what to do or if I’m seeing things incorrectly. submitted by /u/Silly_Assistance_558 to r/Codependency [link] [comments]",

      "content": "I’ve only managed to play halfway through the second game, and I simply lack the patience to continue. The game’s controls are undoubtedly the worst I’ve ever encountered. They’re incredibly delayed and unresponsive at times, which is incredibly frustrating. For instance, when I press the jump and grab button to climb an obstacle, the character doesn’t grab on, so it takes me about a minute to climb onto something. Additionally, during chase scenes, I often have to run and jump over a ledge and onto the other side. However, the character doesn’t jump far enough sometimes, and I end up plummeting to my death. So, I have to re-do the chase scene multiple times until the character finally decides to jump far enough and make it across. The depth perception of the game is also quite confusing. When I walk on narrow pathways, I always end up walking and falling off the side because I can’t tell how close I am to the edge. There are also a few chase scenes where I have to slide into a vent hole to escape, but of course, I slide into the wall, missing the vent hole, and the monster catches me. The co-op mechanic in the second game is also annoying. Your teammate doesn’t help you out when you’re lost and don’t know what to do next. They only assist you when there’s something for them to do, like a jump assist or pushing something heavy. I also noticed that the third game of the series has the same co-op mechanic bs. Apparently, if your teammate dies but you don’t, you still have to restart from the last checkpoint, regardless. So, yeah, screw that. It’s even worse if anything. I’ve played similar games like Playdead’s Inside and Limbo, and they were nothing like this. Those games were actually enjoyable, and I still replay them to this day.

      "content": "In this world superpowers can take many shapes and forms, sometimes they are overwhelmingly useful, other times they are not. However what is consistent are a few major factors: Superpowers adapt the body so they can be adequately used, whether or not it’s used effectively is a different story. Usually superpowers fit along one side of the spectrum of powers, there are deviations but those are mutations and very rare. Superpowers fit within these classes: Physical, Mental, Psychic, Energy projection, or Special. Special usually means that the power is highly specialized and doesn’t really fit within these others After deciphering what power type so someone has, it then becomes a game of figuring out how strong it is. If say someone had super strength it’d go like this: Strong enough to punch through brick without really hurting anything Strong enough to lift up and even potentially throw a small vehicle Strong enough to act as a load bearing pillar on a large building. Strong enough to essentially output as much damage as a small nuke in one punch! Anything stronger than 4. After which they are judged on utility where 5 means it can be used in just about any situation, and 1 being ”it might be better to just not use it.” And finally the power averages for this verse are: Class 1: 9% Class 2: 21% Class 3: 46% Class 4: 23% Class 5: 1% submitted by /u/soup100 to r/PowerScaling [link] [comments]",

      "content": "As many of you have probably experienced in vanilla-ish Create packs, Diorite tends to be a bottleneck due to its dependence on mechanical crafters (which in of itself is quite time-consuming). This has led me to exploring the possibility of using vanilla minecraft Crafters which can be triggered per redstone tick (2 game ticks). The easiest way to perform complex recipes in a vanilla Crafter is to check for overflow on its inputs, only ticking the Crafter whenever there is a surplus of the ingredients, thus keeping the recipe in the Crafter (hence the comparator on depots). The vanilla method of doing this is quite complex for me (and limited by hoppers transfer speed) and so I sat down and tried to figure out a design that incorporates the aforementioned concept. The input is unified with a single Frogport for easy stocking (just slap a gauge on that bad boy for each of your required ingredient) and add filtered funnels for it on the sides of the Crafter. This lets us handle recipes that consist of 1-2 ingredients (e.g. Diorite, Electron Tubes, Propellers, Brass Hands). First set a recipe inside the Crafter and then provide a surplus of both ingredients. If there are items in both side depots, the sticky piston will activate an observer clock which ticks the Crafter pushing the crafted recipe down the barrel and down a chute for storage (a buffer barrel is required so that the chute won't pull ingredients from the Crafter). This can be done very early in survival, with a minimum requirement of making it to having Brass ingots and electron tubes to make the brass funnels, quartz for the observers and comparators. The Frogport handling is entirely optional. Provided an infinite supply of cobble and quartz this can produce 1 diorite per tick, or 20 diorite per second (72k per hour). submitted by /u/Nm3sis to r/CreateMod [link] [comments]",

I like opacity because using this style I don't need to 'pause' the game while the player is doing stuff in menus, this might be handy because it's a management game so, plenty of stuff to do via menus, but there are plenty of simulated RPG elements too, so I don't want to 'keep it going' when you might miss something important or multiple context menus start to queue. submitted by /u/mullerjannie [link] [comments]",

The server has all skills working besides construction where the dev is actually worrking on implementing it. it is one of or if not the first real 2006 server with working lunars and is working on getting the actual quest and area's in game. at least pushing out 1-3 updates a week. Downside of the server is at this moment playercount. 5-10 players. i do think it is worth to play because what they have ingame: - Working clue scrolls - 38 fully working quests - full fight caves, barrows, kbd, chaos elly, Kalphite queen, dagganoth kings, mole. God wars in the future (still undergoing development) i think it does bring back the real authentic vibe we had back in the day when younger like f2p pking wondering around merching. sadly even when trading scams were around ect haha. account creation is website based and the website offer forums only it is not active. the name is 2006reborn i think all of us here know where to find rsps right? those voting pages are still popular :D submitted by /u/Famous_Offer9657 to r/RSPS [link] [comments]",

      "content": "This may seem like an experimental and even a bit provocative post on the subreddit, and the question itself is unusual, I barely dared to write this post. I understand if the question itself seems unpleasant and unusual, but a long time ago I was thinking about why I have been so attached to this game for almost 20 years, even though I don't really like its story or its world very much (sometimes I make fun of it). So yes, I may be strange, but I'm still constantly interested. I follow the game, and apparently, I'm not that interested (not disparagingly) in its entire story, I've never been interested in the medieval theme, but if it was mixed with fantasy elements, then I wasn't interested even more. It never inspired me, but it was always there when I was in a bad mood, I always took it out when I wanted a still life, I just stared at the corridor for hours at Lord Bafford's estate and together with the ambient sounds, I was almost sucked into the game world, and here's the thing, its world gripped me amazingly. It's like a typical marriage, sometimes we fight, but we love each other, and I stick to the other, even if we have disagreements, this game is a bit like that for me. I have two feelings, contradictory to each other, but I still stick to it. It will always be there for me as long as I live. I'm curious about who, why and how is a fan of the game Thief? Do you know everything about it? Do you know its story, the characters? What makes someone a fan? Or maybe you just feel a strong attachment to the game that you don't even understand? I consider myself, for example, I don't call myself a fan, but rather a follower, I who am simply attached to the game, for a few characteristics that had a very, very big impact on me and still have to this day. For this reason, I call it one of the most defining games of all time. I think this is an interesting discovery, through research within ourselves, through deep analysis..., or am I just very lost? And can only a fan be someone who knows the game inside out? I'm curious about your experiences and insights! Feel free to debate my statement. But I felt it was important to mention this once. submitted by /u/relicproject_001 to r/Thief [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Hier der volle Python-Code mit Physik, Motor-Design und Prototyp-Bauplan: Was zum Teufel ist das? · DBD = Dielectric Barrier Discharge – Hochspannungs-Plasma erzeugt Ionenwind (direkter Schub, keine beweglichen Teile). · BLC = Brushless DC Motor – herkömmlicher bürstenloser Motor. · Kombiniert = Elektromagnetische Rotation + elektroaerodynamischer Plasma-Schub in einem Gehäuse. Warum ist das geil? · +30–50% mehr Schub bei gleichem Motorgewicht. · Plasma kühlt die Wicklungen aktiv. · Reduziert Geräusch um 10–20 dB (kein Lager-/Bürstenrasseln). · Redundanz: Wenn der EM-Antrieb ausfällt, treibt Plasma noch an (und umgekehrt). Prototyp für unter 200€: BLC-Motor 2212 (20€) Al₂O₃-Keramikplatten (0,5 mm, 20€) Flyback-Wandler für 5 kV (30€) Arduino Due + Steuerung (50€) Zusammenbau in einem Wochenende möglich. Erwartete Leistung (2212-Motor): · Nur BLC: 800 g Schub bei 12 A. · Nur DBD: 200 g Schub bei 20 W, 5 kV. · Hybrid: 950 g Schub (+19%) bei 13 A, Wirkungsgrad von 65% auf 70%. Anwendungen: · Drohnen: Mehr Schub, leisere Flüge. · Lüfter/Kühler: Keine beweglichen Teile im Luftstrom, selbstreinigend durch Plasma. · Raumfahrt: Elektrischer Antrieb ohne Treibstoff (nur Strom). · Medizinpumpen: Berührungslos und steril. Die Physik dahinter (vereinfacht): Schub_Plasma ≈ μ · (V/d)² · A · ρ μ = Ionenmobilität, V = Spannung, d = Elektrodenabstand, A = Fläche, ρ = Luftdichte Der Code berechnet alles: Schub, Wirkungsgrad, optimale Betriebspunkte, Leistungselektronik. Ist das Science-Fiction? Nein – alle Komponenten sind verfügbar, die Physik ist bekannt. Ein Proof-of-Concept-Prototyp könnte in einem Maker-Lab entstehen. Was denkt ihr? · Übersehe ich etwas Offensichtliches? · Gibt es schon ähnliche Projekte? · Wer baut den ersten Prototyp? TL;DR: DBD-Plasma + BLC-Motor = Hybridantrieb mit mehr Schub, weniger Lärm und aktiver Kühlung. Prototyp für 200€ baubar. Möglicher Game-Changer für Drohnen und Lüftersysteme. Für die Nerds: Der Code enthält vollständige Physik-Simulation, Motor-Design, Leistungselektronik und Visualisierung. submitted by /u/Loud_Noise1959 to u/Loud_Noise1959 [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Last week I started posting my game on like 7 different platforms — YouTube, X, Instagram, Tumblr, Bilibili, Rednote, and Douyin (the last three are apps from the country I live in). After about a week, I’ve got less than 50 followers total, which made me seriously rethink how I’m presenting the game. I usually describe it as a dark, horror-vibe RPG. But honestly, that label doesn’t seem to help much. When I tag it as “horror,” people seem to expect strong scares or jump-scare moments. When I tag it as “RPG,” it gets compared to games that are way more system-heavy than mine. The thing is, my game does have horror elements and RPG mechanics. It’s not that they’re missing. But once it’s put under those labels, it kind of just sinks into the massive pile of horror and RPG games out there. What I actually care most about — the art style, the atmosphere, the world-building — doesn’t really come through in promotion when I rely on those genres. I’m curious if anyone here has dealt with something similar, or followed games in this kind of in-between space.

      "content": "My landlord installed an appliance dishwasher in the apartment like it's a major upgrade, but I've hand washed dishes for years without issue. The machine uses more water and energy than I would, requires special detergent, and doesn't actually clean better than soapy sponge and effort. The convenience is negated by the resources wasted and space consumed. He'd ordered a mid-range model after researching energy ratings and cleaning performance. Found comparable machines through home appliance suppliers on Alibaba at lower prices but worried about warranty support. The dishwasher makes him feel like he's providing modern amenities even though it's solving a problem that didn't exist. We've decided that automation is inherently better than manual tasks even when manual is perfectly adequate. His dishwasher represents upgrading for the sake of upgrading, making apartments more appealing to renters who expect machines for everything. Maybe I'm wrong and dishwashers save time and water when used properly. But mine sits empty because loading and unloading takes longer than just washing would have. Sometimes the old way works fine and new technology is just more complicated rather than better. submitted by /u/FARHANFREESTYLER to r/kitchen [link] [comments]",

When I first joined the project, I was under the impression that I was a valued member of the modding community, and that my contributions would be properly appreciated. As it turns out, I was horribly mistaken. Making assets used by the mods doesn't seem to be considered \"real work\", or at least any contribution anywhere nearly as important as the coding portion. Even though I made every single one of the assets used in both skin packs, I have been declared a lesser contributor than even the coder that made half the code for the first mod. Asset artists aren't even allowed to post any mods in the channel for mod releases. The coder role is called \"Modder\", and only they are allowed to post mods in their name. We are, essentially, assistants to them within the server structure. Also, scamming is just also generally condoned. One of the two mods that I was promised in exchange for my artistic service have been abandoned (I had to accept the skin mod itself as half of the payment for, yknow, doing art for the skin mod), and I am left with almost nothing to show for days of work and sleepless nights spent poring over pages of skins-components. I was called \"just an artist\" by my commissioner, the very one who cited coding half of the mod as justification for them being the largest contributor to the project. I even let them do a different, easier mod for my work instead, and that too was abandoned. I'm not saying don't make art for the server, or make trades for services, or anything like that. Just, yknow, understand what you're getting into, and don't be surprised when you're treated as a second-class creator. submitted by /u/Pyrephecy to r/BadNorth [link] [comments]",

      "content": "It has been a while, but i finally had some time to draw more Phasmo ghosts! This is a small project in which i'm drawing every ghost's \"true\" form based on folklore, the game and my own ideas. Basically, if each ghost had their own special model, this is what i'd imagine they'd look like. (I know special models defeats the purpose of the game, i'm just doing this for fun!) Anyway, I based the Myling off folklore (generally a vengeful child who needs to be buried in order to truly rest) and its behavior in the game (quiet footsteps, oddly noisy in parabolic). It's basically a child holding the appearance of an undead young adolescent, and it is covered in feathers (that is why it's so quiet). It wears a mask because its face is decomposed, and you cannot really persuade people to bury you effectively when you look scary as hell. Then Poltergeist: I went through like three iterations of this thing lol (see the last images). I eventually settled on this, mostly based on how it behaves in the game. He throws shit. A lot. That's why he's got big hands. The eyes were inspired by pro wrestling masks. If any ghost would be a wrestler it's the Poltergeist right? As for the rest... i wanted to make it look like a fun strong, slightly non scary dude.

      "title": "When did things change for Nebraska Basketball under Fred Hoiberg?",
      "content": "This historic run for Nebraska has me feeling nostalgic and looking back to the dark days… The last three seasons of this program have been night and day compared to the early years of Fred Hoiberg’s tenure. The program is 62-25 (.713) since the start of the 2023-24 season. It’s an incredible turnaround after going 40-83 (.325) from 2019-23. We were an utter dormat and finished dead last in the Big Ten for the first three years. We probably wouldn’t have done any better in lesser conferences either (we lost to A LOT of mid-major schools at home). Hoiberg’s early struggles weren’t any indictment of him as a head coach. He walked into a really bad situation from a roster standpoint. In fact, Nebraska only had ONE returning player from Tim Miles’ final team ahead of Hoiberg’s first season. That was Thorir Thorbjarnarson, who only played in 9 games the year prior. Hoiberg never had a consistent roster and had to largely rely on grad transfers from mid-major schools until he could get a good core together. He practically had a completely different team each year and felt like we were just trying to keep our heads above water during those days. When did this program begin its historic turnaround? You could point to several of moments, but I started to feel a shift in momentum at the end of the 2021-22 season. Although they only won 10 games, the Huskers closed out the regular season with back-to-back wins over No. 23 Ohio State and No. 10 Wisconsin (both on the road). That win over Wisconsin felt very special and was the first sign of the program changing. Alonzo Verge’s dagger 3-pointer to take the late lead still gives me goosebumps: https://youtu.be/NyefZ7OH3OA?si=GGih1zoGAjtN82EE A winning culture was established from there on out… Nebraska would improve to 16-16 the following year, which included a win at No. 7 Creighton (first win in Omaha since 2004 in NIT, and 1995 if you only count the regular season). It’s funny to think about it now, but getting to .500 was a huge accomplishment after the first 3 years. Nebraska has been rolling ever since… making its first NCAA Tournament appearance since 2014, winning the College Basketball Crown and now looks to soar to even greater heights with an undefeated record through mid-January. Right now, they’re not just a lock to make the NCAA Tournament, but is vying for a top seed and a regular season conference title (something this program hasn’t done since 1950!) Such an amazing feat for a program that has yet to even win an NCAA tournament game. Overall, this historic run had me looking back to when it all changed for Hoiberg’s teams. I believe you can point to those March 2022 wins over Ohio State and Wisconsin as the sparks that helped make this program a winner. End of rant.

I’ve implemented a broad phase + swept AABB algorithm which works great in most cases, but incorrectly resolves collisions on both axes when colliding on the seams between adjacent blocks. Isolating the collision resolution to one block “works”, with the issue of the ball phasing through other objects if they’re too close to the ball when a previous collision is resolved. I’ve also tried sweeping and resolving per axis, but was ultimately unable to produce the result I wanted.

Being able to upgrade your weapons with the ores you find in the caves turned out to be a great solution, and the gameplay loop feels much better now. Some of the more astute gamers out there might be aware of a small indie game called Minecraft that also does this. Even though this really helps with gameplay I can't help but feel this could be a step backwards in terms of differentiating myself from minecraft. Does it really matter though?

      "content": "After weeks of confusion, discounts, and overthinking… I finally pulled the trigger 😤 Specs: Ryzen 7 7250 (up to 5.1 GHz) RTX 5060 Laptop GPU (8GB) 16GB DDR5 1TB Gen4 SSD 15.6” QHD (2560×1440) IPS, 165Hz, 100% sRGB 60Wh battery Lenovo LOQ Gen 10 (Luna Grey) Expected delivery soon and I’m already refreshing the order page like a madman 💀 This is my first proper gaming + productivity laptop. I have one big doubt though: Will the Ryzen 7 7250 bottleneck the RTX 5060? From what I understand: At 1440p (QHD), the load shifts more to the GPU, so CPU bottleneck should be minimal. Ryzen 7 7250 has strong single-core and multi-core performance, so esports titles should easily hit high FPS. In CPU-heavy games at 1080p ultra + high FPS, there might be a small CPU limit, but nothing severe. So I’m guessing: No real bottleneck for gaming No issue for coding / engineering work GPU will be the limiting factor in most modern AAA games anyway Would love to hear real-world experience from LOQ / Ryzen + RTX owners. What should I do FIRST when it arrives? Any must-do tweaks or things to avoid? Use cases: Gaming (Valorant, AAA titles) Coding / engineering work Long college hours + travel Any advice is appreciated 🙏 Benchmarks & temps coming once it arrives 🚀 submitted by /u/Designer-Tell-2588 to r/LaptopDealsIndia [link] [comments]",
