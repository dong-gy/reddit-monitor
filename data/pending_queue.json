Although I am relatively knew to Godot itself (not programming) I consider myself to be a decent artist. I can do Pixel art no problem (in Aseprite, for example). I'm not too familiar with vector art tho, but I can learn. My question is which one has the better reception. Is pixel art overall easier to handle? Or doesn't matter? Also, what about resolution? What exactly should I do to prevent distortions and visual glitches? Thanks! submitted by /u/crowkk [link] [comments]",

Watch algorithms like BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, and A* run step-by-step Compare different algorithms side-by-side See how they explore, backtrack, and make decisions in real time Built especially for learners who struggle to “see” what’s happening under the hood Fun fact: this project was a Swift Student Challenge 2025 winning submission. I’d really love for you to try it out and share your honest feedback. Reviews, suggestions, and even criticism are more than welcome - it genuinely helps improve the app 🙏 Download link: https://apps.apple.com/in/app/algomaze/id6753229909 Thanks for checking it out, and happy coding! submitted by /u/HustyFoxx007 to r/Review [link] [comments]",

I kind of wanted to do direct through PSA this time just so I could better track the progress of my order. Without the membership it’s $27.99 a card. The membership at $200 for the year (might as well get CardLadder pro as well since I want to anyways) gets you $18.99 per card bulk submissions (minimum 20 cards per). I’m not sure how often I plan on sending in cards this year. I’m just trying to figure out the best value option. I’m not a dealer or anything I am just in the hobby for fun and if I make money, great.
