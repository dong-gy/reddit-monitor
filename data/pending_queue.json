      "title": "Canto 9 part 3 saved the Canto for me",
      "content": "I was yeat another doomer that really didn't like part 2 (part 1 was great) and thought that part 3 wouldn't be able to neatly resolve all of the threads that PM have spun (hehe! Get the pun!), so I'm glad to have been mostly proven wrong (though I'm still disappointed to have been partially proven right). Firstly, the bad (imo) : I hate the entirety of the \"Araya is Dihui\" plot line. I don't even know why I hate it though, so if I'm being stupid, could any of you tell me why I'm wrong to hate it, and if I'm not, could any of you tell me why I'm right to hate it. I don't like that Ryoshu forgets about Araya. Partially because it feels like all of her struggles were for naught, and partially because it feels like she now has nothing motivating her. I also don't like the irony that the actually caring and loving relationship is the one that is forgotten, while the toxic and manipulative one is the one that is remembered, though the cruelty might be the point. I think Ryoshu's sword (Arayashiki) just being a concept incinerator in a bottle is quite disappointing. Even with Rien's explanation, I don't understand how it will be anything but a neat gimmick that you would use on something that's hard to kill, though I haven't put a lot of thought on this topic. Onto the good: I feel like denying the fact that this canto has the coolest hype moments and aura out of any canto/imtervallo in the game so far is pure delusion. The Nursefathers and Apprentices (minus Lucio and Ren, who were wet blankets) on their own were a joy to watch, but adding Vergilius + Vespa becoming a color + Sinclair awakening his mark + Gregor awakening his arm + the first showcase of the actual Gesselshaft and everything else into the mix, and you can see how it's completely fair to say that this Canto mogs Canto 6 & 8. I can also respect the massive amount of world building and exposition that is present in this canto. I can't wait to see where they go with it in the future. Uhh, Hermann makes an appearance! I love watching her and I think she's a criminally underated antagonist, though the rest of the New League (minus Ahab) can drink battery acid for all I care about them. The main thing I love about this canto though, is Ryoshu. I loved watching her past experiences, seeing how the different flavors of abuse that the Nursefathers used on her affected her, and most of all, seeing her try and break that cycle of abuse for the sake of her daughter. I hate that she failed, though that's mainly because I'm still reeling from the heartbreak. I'll get over myself in due time. Uhh, if you made it here, thanks for reading the ramblings of some rando on the Internet.

I’m not sure how often I plan on sending in cards this year. I’m just trying to figure out the best value option.

Instead, as a and b get closer to being opposites, the returned angle is closer to 0. The more a and b point towards the same direction, the closer the returned angle is to π. Why exactly is that?

They pointed out: The game most likely stores which feather you've shot/\"taken\" down, regardless of how they respawn, and this game memory most likely reset once you've hit all of them. It then checks if you did it in the correct order, if not, no trigger. And this is precisely what I was wondering for the longest time. Shouldn't such game logic be relatively easy to find in the code? Why did none of the crazy Reddit RDR2 detectives find anything similar yet? Even before that, can we somehow infer from the code whether the spider webs or the feathers are triggers that change the game state in any way? submitted by /u/alasthennars to r/reddeadmysteries [link] [comments]",

And now I don't even want to play. This is the second time an incredible item has been ruined this way. The second character that now feels dead. I took a 3 day break the first time. Now I just feel like: why bother playing? Players and content creators begged endlessly to remove temper bricking. When it finally happened, the game felt great and engagement BOOMED. Little did we know they slipped something worse in the back door: Now you brick your items after investing tons of resources into getting them to sanctification phase. Now you can actually make your items and your character WEAKER. Bad or useless sanctifications are fine. That's RNG. But ruining your gear, making it worse/weaker/useless is just terrible. I would literally be better off if I hadn't played Diablo at all yesterday. I logged in, played a few hours, and ultimately went backwards. That's a brutal, backbreaking feeling that isn't why I play ARPGs or games at all really. The dev behind \"Affix Replaced\" should be moved to the Overwatch team.

About the game: Ashen Seed (formerly Seedbearer – I had to rebrand to avoid legal issues!) is a hand-drawn Metroidvania focused on ecological horror. Think Hollow Knight's exploration mixed with the tragic scale of Attack on Titan. Key features: No contact damage: Combat is about spacing and patterns. Hand-Drawn animation: Frame-by-frame traditional animation. A dark, non-linear world: Set in a subterranean civilization destroyed by surface Titans.

As far as combat goes, we wanted a tactical game where tactics are not just about outmaneuvering the enemy and positioning, but also setting traps for them and using what's at hand on the map to the best effect... like the kaboom shown here.

      "content": "hello! i am working with a team on a project where we have over 200 animated meshes on screen that are being manipulated by an external slider. this project is for a museum and the computer they have is a bit older and slower, and we have experienced a lot of lag and were not sure if it is the amount of animated meshes or the computer's less than stellar amount of RAM, or both! the information i can give on the meshes is they are all planes with extremely low vertex counts and 4 bones at the max. we have looked into various different projects that involve baked animations (most of them relating to creating crowds) but it seems a lot of the tutorials are outdated, or assets they are using no longer exist. the only project that we found that we think can be viable is from the Megabonk creator's devlog, he isn't using a specific asset. (at least we don't think he is lol) https://youtu.be/gnxnmw5ryhg?si=G-tIcc0f5gBV6MGv&t=379 (link to video above) the only issue in the video is he only briefly touches on the subject, shows part of the code and moves on. any information about how we can achieve this in unity (unity 6 preferred!),other resources we should look into, search keywords, mentorship, etc would be greatly appreciated! thank you! submitted by /u/Hot-Archer1650 [link] [comments]",
