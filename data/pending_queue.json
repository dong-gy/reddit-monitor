Had 21 Points and did not score in the 3rd qtr but covered in the 4th qtr! Damn Donovan. Cost me a chalky lay. Facilitating most of the game. I guess it makes sense when Garland is out. He nearly had a trip dub NGL I didn't like this lay but came close.. Egor really didn't score after scoring 5 points and of course got hooked! This was a nice lay! Another nice lay that I laddered! This was my chalky lay that came thru! Initially had 5+ Asts on Tre Jones but I thought different because he's starting and only to find out that Billy Donovan benched Tre Jones for Jalen Smith to start the 2nd half. He cost me this lay and of course I got hooked!!!! Got hooked on Nathan MacKinnon. He recorded 1 Point and fell short from hitting this lay! ANother hook!! Igor hooked me twice today and in two different lays Lmfao. One lay for 6 pts and this one for 1 three pointers https://preview.redd.it/uuw4tsguxudg1.png?width=996&format=png&auto=webp&s=1ec390773440a085e6e4bba9e171e891b52383dc Yea, I was big on tre jones.

      "content": "To the people that throw temper tantrums in this game: If someone’s emote spamming on your body or saying thanks, just play along. You beat them next round/fight? Then you emote spam them. That’s classic For Honor. There’s no need to freak out and attempt to throw the match or rage quit. It’s not personal, ever. These people don’t know you, and you don’t know them. So just play the “toxicity game” and laugh at it. It’s hilarious seeing a hero spazz out after they’ve beaten you, and feels great to do the same back to them. If you take it personally, you’re no longer having a good time. You’re angrily mashing your keyboard/controller trying to prove something to someone you’ll never know. The toxicity is normal, but not having a good time on a game you play every day isn’t. TAKE A BREAK, and then come back to the game with a mindset of wanting to have a good time. As weird as it sounds, toxicity in For Honor is not the same as toxicity in other games. It’s woven into the game itself, and for most people, it’s all in good fun. Not everyone that spams has a “fragile ego” or is a bad person. They’re laughing at it, win or lose. You, though, are gritting your teeth and raging. Which just makes it even more funny for them. When you actually get mad, all you’re doing is choosing to not have fun in a VIDEO GAME. So see it as it is, a game, and have fun. That’s all, best wishes to everyone submitted by /u/FeachEE to r/ForHonorRants [link] [comments]",

      "content": "I want to preface this by saying I love YGO. Have since I was young. I’m not a competitive player by any means but I always really enjoyed the back and forths in the anime and dueling friends when I was younger. When Master Duel came out I was thrilled that there was an official sim for the game and got back into it after years. Few years in now and I’ve noticed a pattern. More often than not, people are running decks that love to go first and sets up a board that has multiple negates or floodgates, etc. I’m not mad they exist, they’re part of the game. But why, in the name of the Pharaoh, are they SO DAMN POPULAR. I understand that there are people who are so obsessed with winning that they want to play floodgates and negate boards, but what is so fun about these decks that EVERYONE seems to play them? What is fun about NOT LETTING THE OPPOSING PLAYER PLAY THE GAME? It feels like the equivalent of playing chess as white, making your opening move, and then flipping the board and declaring victory before your opponent can make a single move. Why is this play style SO common? It feels like EVERY. SINGLE. DUEL. It’s to the point where genuinely if I go second and I don’t have any hand traps or a hand with 5 starters it feels like I should be scooping to not waste my time. Even in casual, it’s the exact same. Especially because MD for whatever reason is allergic to best of 3 format so you can’t even adjust to play around a lockdown. I know the play style exists and I know people who just want to win will use it but when did that become seemingly the ENTIRE player base? It’s mad frustrating that I just want to play the game but I rarely ever can because I get hit with every floodgate or negate possible before I even have a chance to play a card. What happened? Genuinely baffling as I don’t see how it’s fun for anyone, especially given that a lot of these decks play the exact same combo every time to get the lockdown. No variety, no change, same combo to prevent your opponent from playing. The same community who hated Mystic Mine with a fiery passion for stopping gameplay seems to be doing everything in their power to replicate it. submitted by /u/Professional-Gas1682 to r/masterduel [link] [comments]",

Kiwi’s not giving themselves time to be in the correct lane to turn at junctions and instead doing it at the last minute putting other drivers at risk. The only time when I witnessed safe driving in new Zealand was from a random Indian couple who slowed and stopped to let pedestrians cross the road after a concert. I’ve traveled almost everywhere in Europe, Italians are crazy chaotic drivers but at least they all suddenly stop when any pedestrians begin to cross the road without any need for traffic lights.

I did three tests, each comprising of 100000 particles affected by gravity How I would normally write the code as OOP, do everything in the class As an Array of Structures (AoS). Which is similar to 1 except the class is now just the data, the logic is in the manager As a Structure of Arrays (SoA). Which in this case is parallel arrays which have synchronised indexes. The code for the tests is here I ran the tests, one after another, 4 times each. I let each script settle in for a little bit, then at a random time took a snapshot of the times in ms per frame for running _physics_process. I'm not a scientist but I thought the results were telling enough.

I'm unsure if it's fixed in 501 or not as I'm still in 401 oxygenos16, I'm also unsure if it's an issue with Chinese device being flashed with oxygenos, but I'm pretty sure that the device is too overkill to actually have that low fps drops to even 90 when it wants. submitted by /u/FyBornEX to r/TheOnePlus15 [link] [comments]",

Things started off great where he basically revolved around me when possible while being able to live our lives. When I got kicked out at 18 I had to move in with his family for a year until my mom could afford an apartment for me and her. Living with him wasn't enjoyable sometimes, he'd ignore me for his games, be rude, and didn't exactly respect my space in our room, I kept my stuff in a corner and he kept throwing his stuff over and in my walkspace. He even would leave me alone without anything to do for hours on end as I cried because he wanted to hang out with his friends who didn't want me included, especially one friend who hated me(I had fucked up and hurt him in the past but we worked through it). I had gone to a mental hospital after maybe 2 months as I just couldn't handle how life was going. I'd pay his bills and help support him through schooling so he could get a good paying job he enjoyed. Now I'm living with my mom and he stays with us, I work minimum wage and make more than my mom, we struggle to pay rent. Whenever I try to ask my fiance for help he seems to act like its such an issue to help pay for a place he basically lives at, he showers the longest, eats the most, does his laundry, etc etc. Now he has even started to basically refuse to pick me up from work because he would rather play MTG at card shops than get me. I feel unimportant, I feel like shit, and I don't feel like he cares. What do I even do? What happens if I just move to Texas from the PNW? What can I do? I'm just lost and need help Tldr: my fiance would rather prioritize friends and mtg over me and I don't know what to do submitted by /u/Uniquegrlygamer to r/relationships [link] [comments]",

I can speak english if needed but as a non-native I think I can't \"teach it\" hence I would like to emphasize my offer to help with french. As for me, I'm a 24 years old man from France that love to learn languages, maybe a little too much because I tend to take too much load at once on that subject but I love it. If you care about my others hobbies, I love Formula 1 with all my heart. I love doing sports, which include mostly running, badminton, tennis, hiking and climbing, staying healthy in general is a subject I like. I used to read a lot of fantasy, although way less nowadays. I like coding and making new engineering projects in general as it's the field i'm currently studying in. I also play a lot of chess and some videos games. I think that's most of what I do but I'm open to talk about anything because it's precisely what I like, to talk about something, a country or whatever I don't know well ! As for you just be truly willing to learn. I usually have free time during weekends but during weekdays it's harder for me to be active. I don't require a lot of activity but the only thing I'm asking is for you to be willing to find subjects to talk on. Because usually on here I try to give subjects to talk about but I'm meet with a dry \"yes/no\" response which isn't ideal for practice. Otherwise I'm open to anyone ! Have a nice day !

      "content": "We often see \"movie adaptations\" and that phrase has become a meme, because movies made by Hollywood radically alter the look and feel of a franchise until it becomes unrecognizable. The best \"movie adaptation\" anyone could do should be a 2 hour cinematic for a game. No need to \"reimagine\" with a \"director's vision\". This bad habit of Hollywood is more about ego pleasing of the makers of the movie, than actually selling a franchise to newcomers. They did a great job with Arcane. Arcane is a 6 hour game cinematic. No need to \"adapt\" anything. Game cinematics are already a movie. Just make the game cinematic long enough. After seeing the great work in Mechwarrior 5 Clans cinematics, and how cool the story is, and its look and feel, that is exactly the look and feel that a Battletech movie needs. Just make a 2 hour game cinematic telling a story, made by the same people who made the game cinematics, and voila, you have the best Battletech movie possible. This is my proposed formula for a cult Battletech movie or show. If anyone has a better I dea, I am open to change my mind. submitted by /u/JoseLunaArts to r/battletech [link] [comments]",

It would also be a great way to farm money too because i believe that dungeons should give a lot of money depending on the difficulty, for example give 20k money, meduim40k, hard 60k and nightmare 80k money i think it would make grinding for money much more easier, they could also add new boss drops within these dungeons that would have good passive when it comes to forging because i'm kinda getting bored with mine this, then get this pickaxe and mine this it would make progressing seem much more fun and what do you guys think about this idea and feel free to leave your opinions about this. submitted by /u/Ok-Perception-4275 to r/TheForgeRoblox [link] [comments]",

      "content": "I've been weighing up whether to get CoC, as it's one of the more expensive DLCs. The reviews on Steam are all rave, but a lot them describe what I think are features of the free patch - trade deals, company rework etc. As far as I can tell, the DLC just adds prestige goods and charters for companies (monopoly etc.). Is there much more, any narrative flavour etc not mentioned in the dev diaries? I appreciate that the free patch with the trade rework was very well received, so wonder if some of the love for that gets mistakenly attributed to the DLC by those who bought it on release. So my question is, do people think the DLC content from CoC significantly contributes to the game, enough to justify ~£17/$20 price tag? submitted by /u/Aggressive-Area-213 to r/victoria3 [link] [comments]",

You can put all the magic logic in the ring class itself and feel a little bit like a wizard that's actually crafting magic rings. But it should be fun for players too. Is this a workable solution?

Question: What’s the overall strategy to have the strongest empire while keeping a very small empire (as in: minimal number of star systems under my direct control)? Context / what keeps happening to me: I’ve been playing “grab as much territory as possible” because it feels like the only way I can scale my economy enough to build fleets. I’ll expand hard and stretch myself thin across 100 stars just to hit ~100k fleet power…and then I’ll check my neighbor who only has like 12–20 systems and they’re sitting at 590k fleet power. That gap feels insane. So: - How do you actually play “tall” in Stellaris and still be #1 militarily? - What are the key pillars (planet specialization, tech rush, megastructures, vassals/federations, etc.)? - What should my early/mid/late priorities look like if I’m trying to stay small but punch way above my weight? - Any specific builds/starts/civics that make this click for a newer player?

      "content": "I played the game different than I normally do with any game. Played how I wanted it. Probably put in 6 ish hours. I finished it for what makes sense for the character I created. My character was an experienced redguard bounty hunter. Wanted to leave hammerfell for something new to spend the rest of his life. Planned on retiring. But got arrested and lost everything. He had to start from scratch. Instead of answering the Dragonborn call, he chose to be selfish. He did every bounty he could, killed dozens of bandits, all to purchase a property near the corrupt town of Falkreath. I finished building the manor, I looked out the alchemy tower, and that was it. I did what made sense for the character I created. I may go back to him later but as of now he’s done. I’m not done with Skyrim, but this was one playthrough out of many. Posting this for someone who was in a similar boat to me. You don’t have to even touch any real quest, you could play it as a sandbox, an adventure game, a completionist game, or like me. Create a character who has his own motives and finish the character how he/she would. submitted by /u/Ok_Iron_9088 to r/skyrim [link] [comments]",

Yet they stated that they're disabling this feature? Stitching the two sides back together like in the picture would allow a proper naval front to develop with a midline of island hexes from Godcrofts to Stema Landing and the eventual target of landing on and overrunning the enemy's large island. A big gripe that I'm hearing from naval clans about this announcement is that they're forced to choose between the lane that can invade the enemy's large island or the lane that can only defend their own faction's large island. It just feels like a huge missed opportunity turning what could be a dynamic ocean lane into two linear ones. submitted by /u/Cakey642 to r/foxholegame [link] [comments]",

We'd like to open up the Kitchen and large Living Room so they feel more connected when spending time in those areas. If we used the current combined area marked \"Kitchen, Living Room\" as our primary living space, it wouldn't be large enough to host gatherings, and then we're kind of wasting the large \"Living Room\" space on the left. Our idea is to basically remove the walls on either side of the Dining Room. It will also require moving the oven from the Dining Room wall along the back wall, and then perhaps enlarging the island. I think we'd then plan to keep a dining table where it is, there just wouldn't be wall boundaries on either side. Does this make sense? It still seems like we're not optimizing the space since now we also have the smaller \"Living Room\" area that isn't really used, but maybe this is the best we can do without major renovations like relocating the entire kitchen. I'd also really love to fit an office somewhere, but it's not necessary. Thanks! submitted by /u/dmeixner to r/floorplan [link] [comments]",

For this reason, we recently started a Patreon page where we share literally everything and you can join us for free. 🩵 To give you a little taste of our aesthetics and vibe ✨, here is our logo and banner as well as a character teaser we recently published. https://preview.redd.it/ngpmmji9nydg1.jpg?width=2643&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a0b50b5388033328a60146c6a597a0e539ad4fed https://preview.redd.it/nlhp7lz5oydg1.png?width=1736&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c902fe69051be308a00a434dd0d80e509f4135f This character has since then been revealed, so if you are curious to know more and want to keep up with the character or the game’s development please join us on Patreon. Our goal is to build this game with people who love otome games as much as we do, not just quietly behind closed doors. If you have questions, thoughts, or just want to say hi, we’d love to chat in the comments.

I was most intrigued by the Limited Table Space rule and the possibility of endless exploring/infinite play space, both of which I hadn't heard about. Limited Table Space (timestamp 13:00): This says you must have space for at least 4 - 8\" X 8\" (200mm X 200mm) map tiles for your game but you can put out as many above that as you can. This is possible because as you explore you can take map tiles off the table that no Helldivers are on (or if they are on they die) to make room to add others. This mechanic also allows for... Endless Exploring/Infinite Play Space (timestamp 13:58): Since the battlefield isn't limited to a set number or specific tiles you can potentially keep exploring down an endless corridor of map tiles if you wanted to! This is a unique mechanic that I think can make for some interesting situations. And since map tiles are shuffled and recycled it really will randomize the events/POIs/etc you find if you choose to go this route. submitted by /u/MelArlo to r/TableTopHelldivers [link] [comments]",

Whenever I try to join a game using a code, the game simply loads until this screen and never connects. I’ve already: Changed network settings Tested on different internet connections Tried different networks entirely So far, nothing has worked. What makes this more confusing is that it seems to be OS-related : If I host a server on macOS , no one is able to join. If a friend on Windows hosts , everyone (except me) can join almost instantly. Because of this, I strongly suspect the problem is related to macOS ↔ Windows compatibility , or possibly how hosting/networking is handled on macOS specifically.

      "content": "I don’t hate these movies at all. In fact, I enjoyed them, as did most people. But there’s just something about a superhero origin story that can’t be beaten, especially when it features characters who haven’t had a good origin movie in a while. I like to see the contrast of the hero before and after they get their costumes and powers. It’s emotionally fulfilling to see them go from a powerless but well-meaning nobody, who wishes they could do something to make a difference in the world, eventually go through the trials and tribulations that turns them into that super-powered someone who can finally make a change they want to see. In the 2025 movies, we never see who the baseline “Clark Kent” was without his powers and costume except for some vague flashbacks. In First Steps, we hardly get to know what Reed, Sue, Ben, and Johnny are like before the space incident, other than “they’re a family of famous astronauts.” What makes them tick? How do they view the world and everyone in it? How do they respond to problems if “superpowers and influence” aren’t an option? These types of questions are important if you want the audience to have a strong emotional attachment to these characters. I know, people are getting sick of superhero origin stories, and Superman’s origin and the Fantastic Four’s origin are already well-known to most people. But the “Hero’s Journey” is such a timeless story concept that I’m sure there could’ve been a way to make it feel fresh, or at least nostalgic to moviegoers. submitted by /u/Sectumsempra845 to r/unpopularopinion [link] [comments]",

During the weekdays I'm working as a software engineer, in the weekends and evenings I try to relax and do fun stuff. Some of my interests: Music Mostly scouting for records in the record shops, listening and enjoying new music and visiting concerts. Genres I like are psychedelic rock, punk, some metal, some rap and anything progressive. The last record I've bought is from Jehtro Tull and the last concert I've been to was Psychedelic Porn Crumpets. Sports Mostly watching sports (football) but I also enjoy the occasional swim and I've been trying to go to the gym more often. Gaming PC is my platform. Been playing alot of Counter-Strike for the last 15 years, but I love most kind of games. Long conversations That's the thing that makes me the most happy I think. Long, maybe deep, conversations on any topic with a good friend, count me in! I won't give everything about my life away, but this is some of it. Anything that interests you or just want to start a conversation? Let's do it! You can be from anywhere, any age, any gender. If you're closeby I'll take you for a lunch and a beer (or non-alcoholic drink if you prefer) sometime soon. submitted by /u/SomeWinters to r/MakeNewFriendsHere [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Little Potion Garden is something I’ve wanted to make for a long time, so I finally sat down and built it myself. It’s a cozy, browser based lite MMO where you can brew potions, grow ingredients, and team up with other players to take down big, ridiculous bosses. No downloads, no grind, no pressure. Just open your browser and play. I’m a dad from Sydney who’s been building games and systems for years, and this one is fully self funded and made in the scraps of time that exist around parenting and life. My 11-year-old daughter is creating the artwork for the game as she learns digital art, and I’m handling the code, design, and everything under the hood. Some visuals are still placeholders while she works through each asset, but every final piece of art you see in the game is hers. I built Little Potion Garden because I love MMOs, but I don’t have the time to live inside one anymore. I wanted something lightweight, social, and genuinely fun to jump into whenever I get a moment. A game that feels welcoming instead of overwhelming. A world that grows over time, not one that demands your entire schedule. If you’re into cozy games, browser MMOs, or just want a place to relax and brew something magical, I think you’ll enjoy what we’re building here. The game updates every week, the art keeps improving as my daughter adds more of her work, and the world is slowly becoming exactly what we imagined.

      "content": "My(31F) partner(44M) is very close with his daughter(19F). I long ago suspected emotional incest but he assured me he never confides in her or looks to her for mood stability. However, I strongly believe she feels like it is a responsibility of hers. She feels like it is her job to make her dad happy, and she constantly asks for alone time/trips. She follows him around the house like a puppy dog (even into the bathroom) where he has to stare at her like, are you gonna leave? She cannot function without him. She describes her body to him, asks inappropriate questions about his genitals. She’ll even lay on the floor right in front of him and shake her butt. He says he doesn’t establish boundaries bc it’s a free for all at their mamas. Basically, he doesn’t want to be a prude bc their mom is so open. He wants to be the fun parent…to the point that both of his kids have zero responsibility in our home and literally get whatever they ask for. It’s their way or the highway. Anyway, I just feel like the signs are there for both of them. There’s an immense codependency. She just went back to college after a month long break and he’s been anxious and moody since she left. He’s been snappy at me and distant. She calls every hour of the day, when she visits from college she can’t be away from him. She can’t even stay the night at her mom’s house and when her mom invites her to dinner, she invites my partner to go too! And she loves her mom. Has the greatest relationship with her, but cannot be away from dad. Idk what to do or if I’m seeing things incorrectly. submitted by /u/Silly_Assistance_558 to r/Codependency [link] [comments]",
