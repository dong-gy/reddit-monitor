I recently released an interview with the team behind Weast Coast Games all around branching out from being solely a branding and packaging studio to a board game company (and we talk pretty extensively around their design philosophy and process). Sincerely not trying to be spammy! I just figured folks in the sub would be as interested to learn about how a brand / company like this is built. I think it's pretty rare to get a look into how a studio like this balances craft and creative ambition with the realities of producing and selling physical products — and I hope you enjoy the conversation as much as I did!

It’s not enormous but at the same time not small or awkward to hold for a longer session. -Construction wise it feels very sturdy and has held up well in the short term. So hopefully that will last but time will tell. -The sticks, buttons and triggers are all smooth and very responsive. -Easily my favorite part of this and why it stands out to me is the ease of use and connectivity. It truly is plug and play with no Bluetooth settings to mess with, you just connect it via usb and you’re playing in seconds. The other big W for me is that I can use the S9 without having to take off my iPhone case. I have the 17 pro in a caudabe sythesis case (which is about an average size case) and it fits snug with it on there.

We have strong heros that can solo lane well. Even jungle if things were tweaked a bit. Bring in a draft system where we can discuss what lanes we want this could be a really strong system. Bring the shared economy down allow for hyper carries and supports that don't need eco, allow for a jungler to spend time farming the jungle and a mid laner that can rotate and I think it would be neat. Have the devs consider this? I know the community is split on solo lanes but that's primarily because the issues that come from the 4 lane system, no draft/lane pick/ and the economy doesn't really need those roles. But considering they went from 4v4 to 6v6 from 4 lanes to 3 I'd like to see them try it out. I'm yearning for the days of holding down my lane with a strong solo laner keeping an eye flout for ganks.

      "content": "So I'm currently playing DMC2 and noticed there's a map that looks vaguely as if Australia and South America are connected by Central America, and supposedly the game takes place in a nondescript European town. Since I've heard people say Dante (and by extension Vergil) is meant to be British, does that mean that the UK exists in the DMC world? Or is it an alternate version of the UK? For example, Lucia seems to have a French accent. So does France exist in this world as well? Dante doesn't have a British accent. I would assume Eva would be British, because demons aren't from England (as far as I'm concerned anyway). I'm really curious because so far I haven't seen many descriptions of what the world is like in DMC. Most towns seem deserted or abandoned. For Mallet Island it makes sense to be deserted, but I'm playing DMC 2 and it takes place in some random European town that doesn't seem to be inhabited some reason. And how do demons manifest in the human world? Do people summon them, or are there places that act as natural portals between the human and demon world? Or can really strong demons come and go between the human and demon world? About the timeline: since most of the locations have electricity besides demon magic and puzzles, but it's obviously not modern technology, would it be safe to assume the time period for DMC games would be the 80's or 90's? Or maybe the 2000's? Is there any official year for when the events take place? submitted by /u/higurashi0793 to r/DevilMayCry [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Like they did with blade dancer? This is a typical Russian game dev tactic. Release new class and make it OP and fun to sell max DLC copies. Later nerf it in time to sell the next one. I went through that almost every season with War Gaming games and whatever new OP tank they’re trying to sell. It’s pretty obvious Overseer is really strong so my guess is they will. Am I butthurt about blade dancer? Yeah, a bit. Kibellah is my favorite companion. Am I late to the party? Yeah I am. Was busy playing other games until now. People saying the debuff you get now with bladedancer doesn’t matter cuz the fight “is over in one round”. Which is pure BS. Besides maybe some easy random warp route fight on the ship, there’s many fight like the one on the stolen tithe ship where you’re facing two large groups of enemies one of which you can’t even reach until you hit the button nobody is finishing that fight in one round. So that debuff neutered the class and it sucks. submitted by /u/coldbreweddude to r/RogueTraderCRPG [link] [comments]",

(in which case, the diagram I used for example is a bit inaccurate. such a polygon would probably be fine. the issue is occurring for me on a polygon where one edge uses a large amount of baked_points gotten from a curve2D) this issue is confirmed present on godot versions: 4.3, 4.5.1, and 4.6 top: flickers, bottom: fine. box is viewport representation submitted by /u/Ok_Glass_2546 [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Ok, so I'm definitely not maxing out my abilities here. To be honest, I never really put much stake into changing my setup for tournaments vs farming runs. I started using Project Rend (thank you for a mac version) and it has this handy tourny prep checklist. However, even though I'm mid game, most of these checklist items make no sense to me. Can someone give me an ELI5 on what I should be doing here? * How do I, and what would I change, to update my range and shockwave labs? * Why would I respec my workshop? * What cards should I use in Tournament (I have 14 slots and all cards maxed) vs farming? * What Modules should be used in Tournament vs farming? * What is \"update Freeum Locks?\" * Update guardian chips - Is this just spending my chips to upgrade my guardian(s) * What is a bot preset and how do you change it? * What is the damage slider and why would it not be 100% * Target Priority Order - Right now I priortize protectors. Should I change it for farming and tourny? * What UW would I want to turn off to start a tourny!? Thank you for coming to my stupid question symposium. submitted by /u/TheKrs1 to r/Thetower [link] [comments]",

Any app or software instances using my GPU will randomly freeze up, for example, if I'm scrolling a website in my browser it will sometimes stop moving completely, but then if I alt-tab to a different window and back, it will evidently have taken my input as I'm further down the page. I get the same thing with Spotify too, but slightly different - if I open a playlist on the app and start it then tab into work or a game, then when I come back to it later, the app is completely broken visually - but my input is still clearly being read. I was previously on a 3080, now on a 5070ti. I did a clean DDU driver install already when switching the cards out and it still persists. During this process I also changed my chipset drivers, flashed my bios with an update, etc. For more information: Motherboard - TUF GAMING x570-PLUS GPUs - Previously Palit 3080, now Gigabyte GeForce RTX 5070 Ti WINDFORCE OC CPUs - Previously AMD Ryzen 9 3900XT , I now have an 8-core AMD Ryzen 7 5800X3D RAM - 32GB, 3200MT/s, 2x16 GB sticks (can't remember the manufacturer, sorry) PSU - 1000W Cooler - Noctua Nh-d15 GPU Driver: Currently still on Game Ready 591.59 Monitor: MSI Optix MAG274QRF-QD Not sure if it makes any difference, but also noting here that I use DisplayPort. Bit of a vague post, believe me if I knew a better way to describe this I'd be looking through old forum posts and stuff, but if anyone could give me any new ideas I can run with I'd be grateful as this has been going on for a few months now.

      "content": "This is a long shot but maybe somebody has better search skills than I do. I'm trying to find a game that matpat played on GTA live It was a demo of an RPG type game. Top down, RPG maker style. Custom sprites. It had a battle system that was sort of action. RPG-like and I remember he only played up to a boss fight. The neat thing about this game is that it gave the player different choices and some of those choices affected what happened. The character was in a mansion type house and I remember there being a kitchen on the right and I remember there being a front door in the living room where this boyfriend and girlfriend would knock on the door and you could choose to let them in or not because a killer was after them. I think it was actually a cult that was trying to kill them, but I could be mixing games up. I remember that the character could get this magic power and so one of the attacks that matpat kept relying on was this vine attack stayed close to the ground. He had to dodge enemy attacks bullet hell style sometimes. This may have been the era when mirror Matt was there or even potentially when steph was on the couch but I don't think it was THAT far back. I swear the video had a tag title of \"killing my friends\" or \"a cult killed my friends\" something like that.

      "content": "Hello! I always bought normal gaming headphones, right now i’m rocking the Logitech G Pro X. I work in IT and I dev as a hobby, so I can have headphones for 15 hours a day sometimes, they are wireless so I legit almost never remove them. I think it created some problems and infections in my ears because of the heat and humidity. My ears now need to be dry as a desert for some medical procedure. I need breathable headphones. I was looking at the Sennheiser P38X. Is it safe to assume that openback = breathable? This is my number 1 criteria rn. I think the price of the P38X is right but if theres better for the same price but with no mic, im down. Wireless would be good too, i’m always shirtless like a redneck and cables tickle my man tits Thanks! 😊 submitted by /u/Olick to r/HeadphoneAdvice [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Hello all, I (25yo female) and my husband (35 yo male) got married a year ago. We met thru work and dated for a year before getting pregnant and married in 2025. While we were dating, I knew I wanted to marry him bc he’s more mature than guys my age. We were aligned on things like house, finances, kids, big life things. There were things I had to forgive him on while we were dating . They still scarred me and gave me trust issues. I took advice from my mom that if the good outweighs the bad then I shouldn’t leave bc that’s what makes marriage work. The issue is he’s different now than when we first met. He used to never play video games, we were the outdoors/travel couple. Now all he does is go to work and come home and play video games every single day even on weekends, even when we have family who flew 6h to visit us. If giving the choice, that’s all he’ll do all day. I live my life with intention, I don’t relax until the house is cleaned, I work out and study everyday. On my days off, I plan things for us to do, road trips or trying new restaurants. If I ever play video games, I play with him cus it’s still productive since it’s spending time together. I feel that he has no ambition, no desire to have sex, no desire to spend time with me either. tl:dr He is just too comfortable. I can’t help but feel that it’s bc he’s old and stubborn. Alot of times, I feel like I’m wasting my youth and sexual energy. On the other side of the coin, we have a family, house, and life that we agreed on. Is this just how marriage is? Am I wrong for asking him to be more spontaneous and fun? My biggest fear is living a boring life like this - unromantic marriage. submitted by /u/Repulsive_Mall3372 to r/Marriage [link] [comments]",

      "content": "I’ve been wondering about a choice in the English dub, specifically why almost none of the characters speak with a French accent (with the notable exception of Esquie). What feels odd to me is that the game is very explicitly set in a version of France, the worldbuilding leans heavily into French culture and characters already include a lot of French expressions in their dialogues (cuss words but also more normal words like bonjour and mon ami). In recent years there’s been a growing trend across all mediums to preserve linguistic realism, especially when the setting is so culturally specific. Given that trend, I’m curious why the developers or localization team chose English accents here instead of French accents across the cast. Was this discussed in interviews or dev commentary? Was it a clarity / accessibility concern, a budget or casting issue, or a stylistic choice to avoid potentially \"bad\" or distracting accents? I’m not saying accents are mandatory, but given how prominently Frenchness is baked into the game’s identity, the choice stood out to me. Interested to hear others’ thoughts or any concrete info on the decision. submitted by /u/lunadiparmigiano to r/expedition33 [link] [comments]",

I know it’s a lot to ask from strangers, but if anyone would be kind enough to gift it to me, I would really appreciate it so much.

      "content": "I’ve been thinking about what’s actually missing to make the Steam Deck feel like a \"complete\" ecosystem, and I think it’s the lack of official non-game apps in the Steam Store. Imagine if you could just search \"YouTube\" or \"Netflix\" directly in the Store in Gaming Mode, hit download, and have it show up in your library with a proper UI. Why this would be a game changer: • No more Desktop Mode: Right now, if you want Netflix, you have to go to Desktop, mess with Chrome/Edge, and paste launch arguments just to get a \"kiosk\" mode. It’s a clunky barrier for casual users. • Native Navigation: On Xbox or PS5, the YouTube app is built for a controller. On the Deck, we're basically just using a web browser with a mouse-to-joystick layout. • The \"Living Room\" Factor: If Valve wants the Deck (and potential future Steam Machines) to dominate the living room, it needs to handle media as gracefully as it handles games. submitted by /u/Admirable-Design3391 to r/SteamDeck [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Hey folks, After tinkering with polygons and sNgons, I finally gave birth to NgonPoly , a true first in Fusion’s 2D space. This little one isn’t just another shape — its perimeter stays a perfectly walkable polygon, no matter how you tweak the size, number of sides, rotation, or origin point. Sure, the demo looks rough (don’t judge the baby too harshly), but this proves we’re really playing in real 2D space here. Unlike the standard polygon that just messes with the image, NgonPoly’s transformations affect the polygon itself — no more annoying ratio distortion or perimeter mismatches. Exclusive features? Glad you asked: An input for any 2D object that lets you make it follow NgonPoly’s polygon and length, without writing a single expression . Customizable background and border colors to style your shape right from the inspector. And yes, this kid’s a bit hyperactive — ready to take on dynamic animations and shape morphs with high energy! This is a game-changer for motion design: precise control, accessible polylines, and smooth animations — all in one neat package. NgonPoly is just getting started, but trust me, it’s going places. And of course, when it’s fully grown and mature, it’ll be free for everyone to use and enjoy . If you’re into clean geometry and fun shape-building in Fusion, give it a look and tell me what you think! submitted by /u/Glad-Parking3315 to r/davinciresolve [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Hey folks, I’m a solo dev and for the past months I’ve been building Tasko , a small web app born from my own frustration with classic to-do lists. I wanted something that let me: visually plan projects (not just list tasks) see structure instead of endless checklists So I ended up building a visual workflow-style planner where you can map projects, routines, and steps in a more spatial way. It’s still early, but I just finished polishing the UI and core interactions. Here’s a screenshot of the current state https://preview.redd.it/iqo616h3e4gg1.png?width=2236&format=png&auto=webp&s=b3be7540c929e4ccbba9b1cb615e15d5284f669d So I have a question for you all: - does the concept make sense at first glance? - would you personally use something like this? -what feels confusing or unnecessary?

Kayla Skrlik displayed some of the worst sportsmanship I’ve ever seen in a curling game. Not only was the rock Sturmays to sweep, but her sister very clearly burned the stone and that’s nobody’s fault but her own. My biggest quarrel with this is how Skrlik made Sturmay throw her last stone even though the Skrlik stone was very obviously not shot. Remarkable unsportsmanlike behaviour. If I were Sturmay I would’ve simply pulled the stone off on account of Skrlik even making her throw that last rock. Sturmay handled it well. submitted by /u/Double-Outcome1103 to r/Curling [link] [comments]",

Although this is my first job, leaving aside my internships, I really feel like I am wasting my time because I don't see how what I am doing is helping me progress as an engineer.

For context, I have done projects to be used in labs at my university, and my thesis, which consisted of designing a complete IoT electronic product, won a national industrial award. The thing is, that hasn’t been enough to secure one of the few jobs in the field in my country so I have thought that if I do the CID certifications and also manufacture the circuits I make in the courses by myself for my portfolio, I might have better local or foreign opportunities. submitted by /u/Thin-Letter-8610 to r/PrintedCircuitBoard [link] [comments]",

The only other game I can think of with combos is the Mario RPG remake, which added super moves based on your party combinations. Are there any others? I don’t think Persona 5 counts because the showtime attacks don’t require both characters to actually be in your party. submitted by /u/El__Jengibre to r/JRPG [link] [comments]",

I wouldn't particularly say it's the world's best playing experience - holy shit do I feel spoiled comparing my current gaming experience to this, it's the same feeling as comparing contemporary games to, say, the I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream adaptation - but it's definitely a very nostalgic experience to boot up.

Dry Rot itself is extremely hostile to anything, and has grown to a larger size and strength than the other stumps by just devouring whatever stumps were in Hollowed Woods with it. https://preview.redd.it/dpq47ybzi5gg1.png?width=1065&format=png&auto=webp&s=9277dac2996959e371d39efa87d3927f14f2014c https://preview.redd.it/7xt3k8t1j5gg1.png?width=973&format=png&auto=webp&s=b9f4a340c4bcbd8e3b7313318ac829511cbd568a Stumps according to the actual in-game models are around 10 to 11 feet (3.0 to 3.3 meters) tall...

Sometimes I focus on modern games for a couple months, and then sometimes I focus on retro games. I prefer original hardware, but I mod or hack my consoles like my 3DS and PS2 to play Japanese games. Recently I bought a molded GBA with an IPS screen and USB C charger mod, suffice to say, sometimes I impulse buy cool retro stuff lol. Because that thing was not cheap. But it made me wonder, am I in the minority when it comes to playing retro games? Some indie devs like Jonas Tyroller think that game devs generally play a lot of games, yet others like Thomas Brush say they don't have time to play through much games with everything else in their life. submitted by /u/Chopdops [link] [comments]",

Does anyone know roughly how much gameplay time it takes to get to the point of needing to buy the expansions not included with the recent free code or VIP? I have VIP but dont want to buy the expansions until im near actually needing them. Is following the Epic quest line the easiest way to level? If yes, does it just linearly take you to level appropriate zones throughout the whole leveling experience? If no, can i just look at the levels by zone on the wiki and follow that? Should i just be doing the highest level quests i can? How does the instance finder work? Can i/should i use that at any point before max level? For reference i am fine with leveling taking however long it naturally takes, but i am not looking to get sidetracked. I want to actually get to end game in whatever is reasonable for the games pacing. submitted by /u/SWAGGIN_OUT_420 to r/lotro [link] [comments]",

Beelink mini, ryzen 5 6600u 16gb ddr5, built in amd 660m graphics, I know it's light, but it'll get me started. 43 and 32 TV's homemade controller out of my steam deck box w 8 buttons.. real high tech. Used baller installer So I set up as 2 screens. Put backglass, small dmd, topper, full dmd, music on 2nd screen. Baller doesn't say how many to set as \"visible\", both dmd's? Topper on disable, music off,sound only. Future pin games load ok, Only some actually show dmd and scoring. Vpx games are the most hit and miss, sometimes I have back glass, (finally figured I had to install b2s files), almost never have dmd or scoring. It's driving me frigging nuts. I've deleted and reinstalled the whole deal many times. Yet when I reinstall, a lot of my buttons setting were still there, even though I deleted everything I could find,windows was storing something somewhere... So I reinstalled windows, then baller. At least tables and back glass are in the right place now but still many issues with dmd's.. like backglass is showing OVER dmds. Anyone in NC want to make some money? I thought it would be a good project to put along side my real pins.. argh! Thanks submitted by /u/Kmcmorris to r/virtualpinball [link] [comments]",

I just wanted to reach out and see if anyone has found any more clues/hints or even possible theories about the Pandora's box? It's been moved to the secret room in the lobby, with a sticky note that reads \"Times almost up\", so, I think it's safe to say that we have a limited time to figure it out. I'm not exactly asking for someone to give me the code outright, just maybe some helpful points in the right direction, if anyone even has any ideas. I've seen a few posts but they're all from months ago and some are even about the first box that was in the attic. Thanks in advance for any help/advice! Edit: I would also like to add that I know there’s a possibility that it IS a timed in game event, that there is no way to know the code, but I’ve also seen photos floating around of a server message announcing people had opened it. Correct me if it is confirmed to be a timed event however. submitted by /u/yayeeties to r/regretevator [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Hey everyone! I’m deciding between two concierge jobs in Glacier National Park this summer and could really use some outside perspective. The options: Pursuit – East side of the park Xanterra – Lake McDonald (west side) Both are concierge positions. Important context: I will NOT have a car I’m hoping to make friends , be social, and spend as much time outdoors as possible This is a summer seasonal job, so overall experience matters a lot to me From what I understand so far: Lake McDonald / West Side seems more central, easier to get around without a car (shuttles, Apgar nearby, more people), and more social with larger employee housing East Side looks absolutely stunning and quieter, but potentially more isolated although I'm thinking I could have better access to hiking (without driving?) I’m torn because the east side scenery looks unreal, but I don’t want to end up feeling stranded or lonely if transportation and social options are limited. For those who’ve worked for Pursuit or Xanterra , or lived on either side of the park: Which would you choose without a car ? Which side is better for making friends and having a fun summer outside of work? Any major red flags or things you wish you’d known?

Yet, the game truly is at its best in multiplayer, when two players who actively.want to win grapple with each other. The game is built from the ground up around asynchronous play, so players don't need to be all online at the same time. Another way I'm considering is to not have matchmaking at all, and only run scheduled events — you don't need hundreds of players, just maybe 20 if they all show up at the same time. Besides, competitive aspect shines much more in an actual tournament environment rather than an impersonal ladder. What is some other advice you can give?

The only thing missing were some power-ups, à la the SNES' Baseball Simulator 1000 . The dev (Tipping Goat) is still answering questions on the forums/Discord, which is amazing for a 10-year-old niche game. Anyway, 98 of the achievements are boilerplate story/gameplay grinding achievements. 2 of them require some decent player skill along with a huge dose of luck to finish. (Double Rowdy and Pinball Wizard) The game never got in its way, and replayability is fun/easy enough to keep the hours reasonable and avoid a sense of tedium most of the time. (I left my game on a couple of times, so 48 hours is a gross overestimation of time needed. The hours take some time to figure out some of the pathways or cleverly hidden ones you need to track down.) submitted by /u/Zalym to r/steamachievements [link] [comments]",

The 4 from crew are basically free if you put in the time to find a max lvl crew in here that will let ya stay a week and help you out. Rookie 5 and 100 lifetime challenges also only take a week maybe 2. Basically its easy enough to get at least 7. My buddy got the game a week ago and has 10 already. This is basically a meta 6'8 that I set up to only absolutely need like 4 cap breakers to be quite usable online but still has useful spots for future cap breakers so you don't just feel the need to make a new build once you get them. First 7 go on the handle/SWB for 86/80. After that, 3 on 3pt for 92. After that, mid range and pass acc are both really solid options. submitted by /u/Himdoood to r/NBA2k [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Hello! I have a genuine question and I hope some of you could maybe help. I have been dabling into game dev for a few years now. I never got serious. And just made assets or concepts, I just did it as a silly hobby. Now I wanna get a bit more serious and make a small game to release for free. And maybe gradually get more and more serious with it. The problem right now for me is that I barely have any time after work to do it. And working on the Weekends is not really an option, as I usually work 6 days a week and need one full day for chores and to recover mentally a bit. I know discipline is important. But I genuinely come home from work and sometimes just \"pass out\" (Example: came home from work yesterday and I sat down on the couch to take off my socks and literally passed out for like four hours. When I woke up it was already kinda late to start working on anything. I only managed to cook dinner, take a shower and feed the cat) My 9-5 is more like a 6-6 situation. Where I wake up around 5 to get ready for work, then arrive home in the evening around 6-ish. Depending on the chores I have to do, I end up \"losing\" a bunch of time on cooking or cleaning or washing or whatever house related chore. And that without even spending time to \"unwind\" (like watching a video or reading something) So how would you approach this? Anyone in a similar situation? Getting a new job is sadly not an option for me rn. I imagine I'm not the only one in the situation. So besides the very obvious \"discipline\" is there a way to manage something like this? like maybe splitting up the chores? I already try to do the more time consuming stuff on the weekend? Do you, guys, have a specific way to do things or a schedule? I am very thankful for your answers. submitted by /u/Beef-n-goo [link] [comments]",

I tried Following Online Guidelines on capsules and library heroes, had to redraw Scenes to make the text more readable and fit Steam's Ratio. Took me a couple of days to get them how I wanted and I think it highlights the lighting of the game itself, this way I just had to crop them.

And just made assets or concepts, I just did it as a silly hobby. Now I wanna get a bit more serious and make a small game to release for free. And maybe gradually get more and more serious with it. The problem right now for me is that I barely have any time after work to do it. And working on the Weekends is not really an option, as I usually work 6 days a week and need one full day for chores and to recover mentally a bit. I know discipline is important. But I genuinely come home from work and sometimes just \"pass out\" (Example: came home from work yesterday and I sat down on the couch to take off my socks and literally passed out for like four hours. When I woke up it was already kinda late to start working on anything. I only managed to cook dinner, take a shower and feed the cat) My 9-5 is more like a 6-6 situation. Where I wake up around 5 to get ready for work, then arrive home in the evening around 6-ish. Depending on the chores I have to do, I end up \"losing\" a bunch of time on cooking or cleaning or washing or whatever house related chore. And that without even spending time to \"unwind\" (like watching a video or reading something) So how would you approach this? Anyone in a similar situation? Getting a new job is sadly not an option for me rn. I imagine I'm not the only one in the situation. So besides the very obvious \"discipline\" is there a way to manage something like this? like maybe splitting up the chores? I already try to do the more time consuming stuff on the weekend? Do you, guys, have a specific way to do things or a schedule? I am very thankful for your answers. submitted by /u/Beef-n-goo to r/gamedev [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Breakthrough! I'm happy to share - after weeks of thinkering - that moments ago I've found the solution to the \"Error code 18\" for Epic Games Red Dead Redemption 2 installed with NonSteamLaunchers in SteamOS. Or basically the tweaks to be able to run RDR2 with NSL. The great news is that it allows to run RDR2 directly, or via both launchers, in Desktop mode and Gaming mode. Whatever is preferred. Cloud saves, share game activity with friends and steam performance overlay all work when running RDR2 directly from Gaming mode. Also this saves money having to buy RDR2 a 2nd time on Steam, and no need to deal with Heroic or Lutris separately for just this game. I'll report the solution on ProtonDB as well. Summary: Rockstar and Epic launchers need to be installed from NSL (in same prefix folder ofcourse), latest GE-Proton10-29 (download via ProtonUp-Qt app) needs to be set (check force compatibility steam play) for both launchers ánd RDR2 game in Steam library, WINEDLLOVERRIDES=\"vulkan-1=n,b\" command needs to be added in the Epic launcher's launch options in Steam (do not add in RDR2 launch options!!!), Rockstar Launcher's launch options in Steam need to be copied in full and pasted in the RDR2 launch options in the Epic launcher game settings/properties!!!, in the file ../user/Documents/Rockstar../Settings/system.xml change the value for adapter to 1 but leave API value to DX12, now run RDR2 for first time in Desktop mode from Epic launcher, login via Rockstar Launcher and done. Hope this finds another! :) Cheers I've posted the solution at NSL GitHub too: https://github.com/moraroy/NonSteamLaunchers-On-Steam-Deck/issues/869 submitted by /u/ScubyFlying to r/SteamDeck [link] [comments]",

I wanted to capture the charm of the game’s voxel style and make a level that feels playable, busy, and fun — with traffic lanes, rivers, as well as large mascot builds as accompaniment display pieces. I've already built the whole thing IRL and displayed it at a LEGO exhibition last month. Seeing how positively people reacted to it made me realise I should at least try submitting it. Now, it’s already close to 200 supporters which has honestly blown me away. I did discover there’s another Crossy Road project already up — and I genuinely hope both get support, because it’s a game that means a lot to many people. If you’d like to support it, I’d be incredibly grateful ❤️ submitted by /u/stowball to r/legoideas [link] [comments]",

      "content": "I've been wondering about the performance difference in games where enemies are constantly creating and destroying instances of their state classes, versus an approach where enemies cache their state and simply reset the values when jumping back to a previously used state. I haven't tested it myself since I'm very new at all this and haven't really got the time at the moment, but my best guess is the former is more cpu intensive while the latter uses more ram. So as usual there isn't a \"best\" solution and it all depends on the needs of the game and its bottlenecks. Either way I'd like to read the opinions of experienced devs on the matter, maybe the caching is a bad idea, period, and the traditional way is always better, but due to recent performance-related issues with modded minecraft due to the garbage collector I'm inclined to think otherwise (or maybe that's just java and/or mimecraft's code jankiness). submitted by /u/Y-oshirin [link] [comments]",

      "content": "At this point, where all phones work great for 90% of users, what distinguishes one brand from another, in my humble opinion, is update support (Android updates and security patches) and the speed in applying them. In that respect, for example, the Pixel, with its seven years of updates, is unbeatable. So, if you buy a OnePlus, it will work perfectly for many years (my OnePlus 7 still runs like a dream today), but after five years, you'll have a fantastic phone without updates or security patches, making it insecure and, for many people, useless. So, I don't understand the point of making these phones so great and then not providing better support for them. From 2027 onwards in Europe will be required that the battery be easily replaceable by the user, and I hope that Europe will also promote progress in the updates. Of course, no one from OnePlus or OPPO will read this. submitted by /u/omgletmeregister to r/oneplus [link] [comments]",

I also can create packs for your indie games specifically! In case you may support; https://archonei.itch.io/pixel-art-mega-tree-pack submitted by /u/entei55 [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Hi everyone, I've been working on a proof-of-concept web app that lets you play PICO-8 multiplayer games online with your friends. PICO-8 multiplayer games are designed for local play and you need everyone physically on the same keyboard or controllers. There is no native way to make online multiplayer games in Pico-8. How It Works With PICO Party, one person hosts a room and everyone else joins with a 4-letter room code. The host's browser runs the actual PICO-8 game and streams frames to all players via a peer-to-peer connection (WebRTC). Remote players see the game in real-time and their inputs are sent back to the host, where they're injected directly into the PICO-8 runtime as if everyone was pressing keys on the same machine. Will work even if users are on different networks. This means any PICO-8 game with multiplayer support works out of the box . No cartridge modifications needed if your game uses standard btn() calls with the default bindings. You can play multi-cart games and also use play any custom game as long as you have a link to the .p8.png url. Players can play on mobile with touch controls: a virtual D-pad and action buttons. Great for playing with friends who only have their phone. Try it at: https://picoparty.io Submit Your Games! The current library is pretty small. I've basically just been adding games I have been playing with my friends. If you've made a multiplayer PICO-8 game (or know of one that would work well as long as it is Creative Commons 4.0 or you have the author's permission), I'd love to add it to the library. Just open a PR at https://github.com/dwjiang/pico-party-games with: Cartridge URL (.p8.png) Game name, author, description Player count (min/max) A few screenshots Once the code is merged, the change should trigger a deployment and you should be able to see your game in the app within minutes. Future Feature Ideas If there is interest, I can continue to develop the app. Some ideas that I have: Audio streaming - Currently only video/frame data is streamed. Working on getting game audio to remote players too Public lobbies - Find random players to game with Cartridge discoverability - Allow users to sort by popular/newly added cartridges Saving progress - Saving cartdata so users can continue previous sessions. If there's a feature you'd want, let me know. Feedback Welcome I would love to hear what you think, any bugs you find, or games you'd like to see added.

I did it because I wanted to support the community — both on Wayfarer and in Pokémon GO — especially in smaller towns where there are very few PokéStops. I put a lot of effort into my submissions because I actually care about improving the game for other players. What I don’t understand is why people like me get punished for supposedly “small mistakes,” many of which I strongly disagree with or which are simply not true. In the end, you receive a negative mark, and all motivation is gone. It feels incredibly discouraging. What makes this even worse is that there are clearly people who ignore criteria completely, submit low-quality or abusive content, or otherwise misuse the system — and they often seem to be overlooked and not punished at all. That is extremely frustrating. Instead of focusing on those who clearly break the rules, the system seems to target players who genuinely try to help. Because of this experience, I’m honestly at the point where I don’t feel like doing anything for the community anymore. And that’s the real shame here: the people who put in the most effort to improve the game, especially in rural or smaller areas, are the ones being pushed away. I think this is something the Wayfarer community and Niantic really need to reflect on, because this approach drives away the very players who want to contribute positively. submitted by /u/ugartecard to r/NianticWayfarer [link] [comments]",

You clean up crimes, complete jobs, and eventually build your own empire. Unlike typical tycoon games, everything is scripted like a story-driven AAA title. Every action and event is part of a carefully crafted narrative. Here is the thing. So far, it mostly feels like a walking simulator. I really do not want that, so I would love suggestions for mechanics that make the gameplay engaging while keeping it story-driven.

What I built: A tactical card game with priority-based combat. Unlike simultaneous reveal games, one player commits first (card revealed), then the opponent reacts knowing WHAT card but not HOW MUCH resource they're committing. Creates constant mind games. The journey: Started as a tribute to my fond memoried of playing the web based Urban Rivals growing up. Grew to 70+ characters Built deep lore for every character. Added ranked ladder, seasonal rewards, cosmetic marketplace Solo project Tech stack for the curious: iOS native (Swift/SwiftUI) Cloudflare Workers backend D1 database Real-time matchmaking At launch: 70+ characters (all free from start) 6 factions with unique clan bonuses 8-card decks, 2-4 min matches Cosmetic-only monetization 📱 Pre-order: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/elarion-aetherfall/id6754101666 2 days out.

The code conan originally received was in Japanese but in English it translate to this- \"I'm a major league slugger. This is the beginning of extended inning game...? It doesn't matter if you prepare a good stopper... I will turn around the game in the end...\" So here is conan deduction P1- Major league refers to a American baseball league. C1- The entire code must be decipher in English. P2- A good stopper in baseball refers to strong earned run average statistics or Era. C2- The abbreviation of earned run average is Era. P3- Extended innings game in baseball can also be called extra inning games. P4- If you remove Era from Extra it leaves XT. P5- if you put XT vertically and move 180 degree then it represent the Japanese Kanji 文. P6- Kanji 文 represent schools. C3- The bomb is in a school. Now, conan cuts the wire of the bomb in the elevator 3 second before it blast. It result in conan to not get the whole clue but the part of it which was EVIT(unlike the letter this was English even in original translation). P7- Evit turned around will come out as tive. C4- The whole word is actually detective with tive being it's last part. P8- Detective in Japanese is 探偵(Tantei) P9- Reversing 探偵(Tantei) gives you 偵探(Teitan). P10- There are school with teitan 偵探 in it. C5- Mixing P10 and C3 it comes out that the actual place of the bomb is teitan school. P11- There are 3 teitan schools. Elementary, middle and high school. P12- The culprit behind the bomb is targeting people in it attacks intentionally. P13- In winter only teitan high school is active cause of there exam. C6- The bomb is in Teitan high school. Tge reason why this deduction is so hard or good is cause there are no guesses, induction or abduction. Each step follow necessarily from the pervious. And it is also very hard as conan has to realise many thing during the deduction process like- \"MAJOR LEAGUER\" → TRANSLATE TO ENGLISH \"GOOD STOPPER\" → ERA → REMOVE FROM EXTRA → VISUAL ROTATION INTO KANJI \"EVIT\" ON A BOMB LCD PANEL → REVERSE DETECTIVE → JAPANESE REVERSAL → TEITAN And also conan was in extreme pressure while also psycoanalysing the bomber and he correctly deduced 2 separate cipher joining them flawlessly with a countdown.

When in desktop mode, it completely disables every button on the device, so I can’t pull up the keyboard to type in the security code. Is anyone else having this issue? I’ve tried some fixes I’ve read online, but no hope. I’m not going to uninstall and re-install as the download is 120gb, so it will be a refund if that’s my last hope haha (I’ve tried different protons, I deleted the EA app and let it re-install and I’ve tried to do it in desktop mode) submitted by /u/nickldn28 to r/SteamDeck [link] [comments]",

      "content": "I'm making a Dungeon Crawler Rogue-Like using structure blocks, trial spawners, vaults, decorated pots and utilizing Loot Tables for all of my rewards found in the dungeon. But to actually make the game play like a Rogue-Like I'd love to have unlockable items. To my knowledge there's no way to modify a loot tables without going into the file and directly editing it. But if there is a way, that would be amazing. I had an idea to pull it off where if an item that isn't unlocked yet spawns, I can detect that and kill the entity and replace it with an unlocked item before the player picks it up. I'm not using Chests anywhere in the dungeon, so items will basically always exist as an entity at some point. But ideally, actually modifying the loot tables would be amazing. I'm not all the familiar with Loot Table Functions yet, I know how \"set_count\" works but that's kinda it. If a function could check an in-game Score, or something of the like, and then completely change the item, that would be awesome. Alternatively if it can't change what item it is, maybe it can change the other item data? Like enchantments, custom name, and custom attribute modifiers? That wouldn't be as good, but still really helpful. Thanks! submitted by /u/BenManGinger to r/MinecraftCommands [link] [comments]",

Now Loki isn't the broken per say, but his very existence makes these ultimates even worse to deal with \"Oh you're having trouble countering insert the OP support ult that comes with every season how about you do it twice!?\" Now for how I would fix this issue I must first put up an amazing example that just happened to me in a match. Friend is playing Loki and in overtime the enemy CnD ults. Now it would seem like the only option is to copy your other support and stall the game. Except....this genius bastard copies the enemy MAGNETO and takes out the CnD and their Bucky with his ultimate. Then proceeds to help our tanks push the other team away, winning us the match. Noe THIS! this is the type of playmaking you'de from a GOD OF MISCHIEF!! So to keep encouraging these type of plays, I would simply make it so the Loki's that copy ults from their tanks or dps get rewarded with stat buffs if they manage to get off a kill. Like: you double ult with your Punisher and manage to wipe away the Luna ult? Congrats now for 30 seconds you have increased damage and lowered cooldowns! Oh You copied your Strange and stunned and killed the diving Magik and Daredevil? now You have 200 overhealth and your runes get 100 more hp for 40 seconds! Oh you copied your strategist!??? you get nothing and your copied ult starts at 95% instead of the normal 100% I don't want to take away the option to just copy your other support, but instead i want to increase the value in making risky plays!

      "content": "Hey everyone! 👋 I just finished Missions of Pavel - a local multiplayer card game where you and your friends gather around one device and compete as legendary tavern heroes! 🎮 The Setup: Pass your phone/tablet around, each player gets a unique hero with special passive abilities, and you battle through challenges by managing 5 attributes (POW, SPD, BRN, CHA, WIL). ⚡ What makes it fun: 10 unique heroes - Each has a special passive ability (Dark Stalker hides his stats, Drunken Paladin auto-wins on lucky dice rolls, Shadow Ninja's speed counts double, etc.) Animated dice rolls - 3D dice that actually roll when gambling Strategic depth - You can challenge friends to duels, meditate to skip impossible challenges, or go all-in and hope for the best Medieval vibes - Parchment scrolls, wax seals, wood-carved titles 🍺 The Theme: Set in Pavel - a village where King Antony's only concerns are keeping the ale flowing and the peace intact. Dragons, orcs, monks, and dwarves all gather at the tavern for drinks and glory!

      "content": "Created an UpdatePartComponent step to begin to separate the physics update from the internal vehicle update logic. Moved RocketCore and RocketNozzle update logic from the physics loop to Rocket.UpdateRockets. Moved ResourceManager from RocketNozzle to RocketCore to increase the separation between core (internal) and nozzle (external) association. Added propellant mass flow rate to nozzle and core readouts. Fixed very excessive propellant usage due to a sign flip in the consumption logic. Created FxTemperature part component to drive emission and thin film intereference maps. For the moment, this is driven purely from nozzle temperatures. Added FxTemperature component to SubParts with models and components that support it. Removed ResetState() method from PartComponentStateful as it was no longer needed. Fixed a few bugs with higher order symmetrical editing, added a few bugs with higher order symmetrical editing. Swapping between symmetry orders with multiple layers of symmetry inheritence is still a bit touch and go. All in all, going in the right direction. Use PartComponent.TryGetFrom() in a few places where it's less verbose and updated some related doc comments. Added a method to get mutable access to part component states for serialization and UI-context modification. Fixed a case where part components would incorrectly think that they couldn't be updated, leading to emissive maps not working. Improved behavior of temperature emissivity sim, especially for engines at low throttle. Increased maximum temperature for thruster emissive by 1.75 times. Increased thruster emissive intensity. Merged Part and SubPart classes. This should allow us to simplify quite a bit of logic doubling. This is not meant change the player-facing functionality of Part vs SubPart in the game. Quite a bit of clean up is still needed and given the wide reaching changes unintentional regressions should be expected. Return individual TStates and TFxStates by reference instead of by value from PartComponentStateful.StateList. Added individual component and state getters to PartComponentStateful.StateUpdater to match the interface of PartComponentStateful.StateList. Moved the Tank processing from the old TankList to the new PartComponent/State system. Made hot path initialization for type updaters infallible to avoid the infectious complexity of null checking in the vehicle update task. Removed the isEditorUpdate flag for vehicle updates which no longer has a purpose. Created an InertMass part component and shifted readers to use that instead of the template. Added in missing part components from top-level parts. Removed unused PartTree.TotalSubstanceStorageVolume. Moved one last mass template reader over to the part component. Converted engine and thruster controllers into part components. Created a GetSubtreeComponents() function to iterate over all part components of a given type for a part and its sub parts. Fixed a few accessors in PartComponent.List which weren't returning the concrete component type correctly. Return sub parts as a span instead of a collection. Removed thruster/engine controller properties on PartTree. Converted the subtree components generator into a ref struct enumerator to avoid allocation and used it in an additional place. Removed some redundant code left over from tanks moving to part components. Moved some PartTree functionality out of the Part class into the PartTree class. Added a Split function to the PartTree class. Tightened access to the Parts list in PartTree so that it must go through PartTree functions so we can eliminate logic errors where other code outside this class could change the Parts list in the PartTree without performing other related logic in the PartTree. Changed the public Parts collection in PartTree to be a readonly span. Made the static part list on PartTree private. Marked two PartTree lists as readonly. Use GetSubtreeComponents() for inert mass display. Fixed some pipelines being mislabelled as 'Byte[]' Fixed potential issue in Physics IntegrateVelocityVerlet where mass properties were not set for initial state causing a mismatch between first derivatives and half-step derivatives. submitted by /u/panic_in_the_galaxy to r/kittenspaceagency [link] [comments]",

En especial con noticias recientes de que hasta parches están dañando SSDs y la situación de seguridad y vibe coding en Microsoft está terrible. La vara es que yo uso mi compu 99% para gaming. Tengo un setup relativamente high end. De hecho ya tengo una pequeña partición de Ubuntu que uso para varas de desarrollo y tengo un boot manager que hace default en Windows. Quiero consejos para migración...cual distro es buena para gaming? Cómo está la compatibilidad (juego principalmente en Steam pero también tengo algunos juegos retro en GOG) con Proton? Uno puede usar Proton para juegos que no son de Steam? Tengo entendido que jugar en linea es casi que imposible. Solo jugaba BF6 pero ya casi no, y siento que para eso puedo preservar una partición de Windows. Lo que quiero saber es si es posible \"invertir\" mi configuración de discos duros sin borrar muchas cosas. O sea, en vez de 500 gb de Ubuntu y 5tb de Windows, hacer 5tb de Ubuntu, eso puedo hacerlo o tengo que volarme las 2 instalaciones?

We didn’t realize how much of a headache ponchos are until you actually have to make them move (video about that coming). We kept it, of course. It just became one of those small decisions that spirals into conversations about folds, weight, and how cloth behaves in a turn-based game. Still very WIP, but wanted to share that part of development — the tiny choices you fall in love with before realizing their technical cost.

However when trying to move the camera around the viewport I noticed that it gets stuck moving in one direction when I press the key a bit longer. It seems that it \"caches\" the input and keeps using it to move. When I release the mouse button and select any kind of text field, the cached characters get immediately pasted there and the issue disappears until I try to do more stuff in viewport and the whole scenario repeats. It makes any learning almost impossible and really frustrating, as - for example - I cannot press a key to change transform if there is already some input stored. Have you seen this before? Do you know how can I fix this? The issue can be seen in this video . I have released the W key around 2nd second of the recording and kept moving with only RMB held. At the end you can see that \"wwwww\" was pasted into the text field at the bottom just as I selected it.

I started CS50P towards the end of 2024, but due to work and health issues, I haven't yet been able to finish the course. I read that the deadline has been extended to June 30, 2026, and that the work submitted in 2024 shouldn't have been carried over to the 2026 edition. However, when I opened my gradebook, I noticed that it also marked the 2024 work as valid submissions. Is this a bug? Or does it mean that the work completed in 2024 is also valid and doesn't need to be resubmitted? I know that learning is what matters, but honestly, in a difficult moment in my life, I'd like to be able to hold a concrete result in my hands as proof of my efforts, even if it's just a certificate.

It's got the standard 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi (no 5 GHz listed, which is interesting) and the label diagrams seem to show a top-loading dustbin, which would be a nice little convenience. Based on the 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi, I'm guessing this might be a new Q-series refresh or a mid-tier model rather than a new flagship S-series. Where do you all think a bot like this would fit into Roborock's current lineup?

More about the game: Hundred Nights DIFU is a Chinese hell management simulation indie game where you get to manage how souls live in their afterlife. At its core, it has a lot of humor, some sense of cozyness, and a pure build & management gameplay. We take some gameplay inspirations from Two Point series, Prison Architect, and even Dyson Sphere Program. We are a small indie team of friends who share the same passion for game dev and simulation games. The game is still way too early in development stage but we do hope steam page and playtest will be up within this year (follow me for more updates!).

Videći da su RAM cene otišle u kurac i moj trenutni laptop koji sam uzeo prošle godine (R5 6600H, RTX 3050, 16GB DDR5) dosta koči u većim projektima, mislio sam da uzmem upgrade. Razmišljao sam da uzmem Macbook Pro M4, sa pro M4 čipom, 512/24, našao sam neki od 2050e na KP. Pošto macbook apsolutno nije upgradable, mislio sam da se fokusiram na pro čip i više rama a za storage da uzmem barem neki eksterni SSD kasnije. Laptop koristim kao sekundarni/poslovni uređaj, imam računar kod kuće. Voleo bi takođe savete koje alate da koristim. Kontekst, radim game dev samostalno (Godot, Blender, FL Studio, itd) a u firmi radim C++ (Visual Studio), ponekad kotlin/javu (Gradle) pa me zanima da li ima neke razlike u alatima koje se koriste?

But seriously, I know the event is ending in about a week or so and that this skin is VERY desirable due to everything custom and it’s very heavy FOMO.

I've created a health component that handles health given/taken and death, and a health interface to handle communicating between characters. Basic stuff. I implemented the interface on the health component itself instead of on the characters. The idea being that any character I add the component to will already have the interface implemented. It works great, but (and maybe I'm over thinking this..) it feels slightly wrong somehow. In order to apply damage to a character, I need to [get components by interface] because the target implementing the interface is the health component of the character, not the character itself. Example in the comments as I couldn't add an image here. So basically my question is, does using the [get components by interface] function defeat the purpose of using the interface? submitted by /u/ShmodyP [link] [comments]",

As someone who is trying to get into the industry and having worked on short films, I can only imagine the amount of work this took. Hearing about it all on Distractiable and through videos doesn't compare to going through it and with the behind the scenes coming out, we all can tell how much love and creativity went into this. Audiences know when you've put in the work and you've tried your best for a project you love. The sound design, art, costuming, vfx, lightning- everything about it made me feel what I feel for movies when I was growing up. Real sets, seeing an actor engage with real props and the hard thing of writing something surrounding \"one location\". Really cool stuff. It's really inspiring seeing someone go from playing video games at their desk to making a feature length film, especially one that's self funded and is backed with so many people who support it. Just thought I would put it out there that this has really inspired me to go for things and make them happen. I loved the film and hope others also feel that spark of inspiration. submitted by /u/FijianGecko to r/Markiplier [link] [comments]",

There is noway the game is generating revenue at the current state. What do you think, how long will this last? submitted by /u/EugeneTheSadClown to r/UFLHub [link] [comments]",

It took longer than I planned (no surprise there), but I learned a lot along the way — especially that finishing a game is much harder than just making one. I put out a demo last year just to see how people would respond while I was still working on the full game. It didn’t turn out exactly how I imagined at the start, and I definitely ran into my own limits as a developer, but I’m okay with that. Maybe I’ll come back to it someday and see what I can improve. I hope someone out there has fun playing it. On to the next one! submitted by /u/DAMStudio_BR to u/DAMStudio_BR [link] [comments]",

If we ask, where is the red one, he guesses every time, this applies to all colors. Sometimes working with letters, and given 3 choices, he will get them right... For instance which starts with g... \"Green\" and point to it. He knows black, and white, sometimes brown. Other than that, he pretty much never gets it right and instantly guesses a wrong color. Without questioning he would say \"pink!\" or \"the red light\" or \"blue and red make purple\" Any suggestions? Am I just over thinking it? I feel like he should know them by now.

I want to expand my zoo, but I have exhibits where there are way too many animals, but I can't sell them or release them because they're almost all new babies. I can only put them in the trading post, so the trading post is clogged with animals. I can put the animals on contraceptives, but then they all die out unless I'm paying really close attention and then I have empty habitats. Even if I don't put ALL the animals on contraceptives. Is this it? Is this the game? Just monitoring the breeding of your zoo and trying to balance the population? Cause I can't do anything else without the game giving me warnings that there's overcrowding or alphas fighting for dominance every two minutes.

The scholarship and total debt I would be taking on is about the same at both. I'm from the northeast and have no problem settling in PA/Philly long term. I am currently leaning towards Temple due to its location in Philadelphia and its slightly higher ranking/reputation. Since I would already be living in the city for school, I imagine it will be easier to network and secure summer internships/work in Philly, and I know that Temple has great connections in the city. But there are things that make Penn State attractive (a major university, an extensive alumni network, a more secluded location to focus, and, to be completely honest, football/basketball games/being a BIG10 school). I know both are pretty close in the rankings (#50 v. #59), but University Park is kind of the “second campus” for Penn State.

It is a roguelite with soulslike inspired combat, where you will play as a knight, an archer and a mage, each with their skills, strengths and weaknesses. My ideia for an engaging combat is to apply some rules I personally learned from playing some souls games, like no cancellation animation, stamina management, lock-on on enemies, well-timed parries, dodges and skill activations. In the efforts to make the combat work with multiple enemies, it ended up with some free flow flavor. Hope you enjoy it, any feedback is welcome, specially on the combat itself. submitted by /u/John_X_MacTaviX [link] [comments]",

Seems some people draw shadows and put them on a layer so they can toggle them on and off but then confuses me how they can make the shadow adapt to different surfaces. Other method I saw was duplicating the asset, flipping it and using a shader to turn it into a shadow so they can rotate it for a day cycle but that seems rather complex to make it look good. Anyways sorry I know this has been asked but couldn’t find much info if the latest Unity engine can speed up this process. submitted by /u/owlsmoke [link] [comments]",

If KCP refuses, well then I’m sure Ja has a glock somewhere nearby that could make him more agreeable. And once the grizzlies notice the players were swapped, they might as well just agree to the trade. No need to go through the hassle of returning the players.

      "content": "So I am making a game that is in 3D, but needs to look like a 2D top-down viewpoint (currently achieved with an orthographic camera at a 45-degree downward angle, plus an altered camera projection matrix courtesy of huwpascoe's pull request. The sprite is y-billboarded towards the camera. Because the game is viewed from a top-down angle, I drew the sprites in that manner. However, for animations like the one pictured (walking south), the feet moving forward in space is visually represented by the pixels being drawn lower on the sprite, which makes them clip through the ground. https://preview.redd.it/rh5fcr2dnjgg1.png?width=292&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ff2c9fbec530d301621d42689ce7adba0461219 In this picture, I show this clipping along the edge of a floor, so you can see both the sprite clipping through the floor and the edge of the floor revealing the underside of the sprite. I need to find a way to allow the part of the sprite that clips under the floor to still be visible, without causing the sprite to become visible through other objects that SHOULD block the view, like walls. For a while, my solution was to make the sprite be offset towards the camera equally along the Y and Z axes, which wouldn't appear in the camera view, but long-term, I think this workaround could still come back to bite me, like if I wanted to ever include proper shadows and lighting, it would reveal that the sprite is hovering. https://preview.redd.it/8mm8ke7rnjgg1.png?width=384&format=png&auto=webp&s=313703c9fb49b406ebec97802186646db39001a2 https://preview.redd.it/eqbsyygrnjgg1.png?width=687&format=png&auto=webp&s=a5ba5be8a84cd85bf12c3c7a8a862eb05f9645db Pictured above are screenshots of the full 128x128 character pixel canvas being filled with a test texture so you can see the extent of the sprite canvas on the AnimatedSprite3D, as well as what the player object looks like in the engine viewport.

The kind of response that smooths things over and keeps everything comfortable. I felt it form automatically. The right words, the reassuring tone, the version of myself that makes things easier for others. This time, I didn’t say it. I stayed quiet longer than felt polite. The silence was uncomfortable, but it was honest. Saying what was expected would have meant setting aside something I wasn’t ready to dismiss. Eventually, the conversation moved on without the reassurance I would usually give. Nothing exploded. Nothing broke. What stayed with me was realizing how often I trade honesty for harmony without even noticing. I’m still figuring out where that balance should be, but choosing not to perform that moment felt like a small boundary I hadn’t known I was allowed to have. submitted by /u/Rich_Outcome8649 to r/self [link] [comments]",

I worked for my daughters first year and have been home the last year and a half. Recently I’ve really realized the flow of the home, weather the house is happy and flowing or chaotic if really down to me as the wife, mom, and home maker. I have an incredibly helpful husband but he goes in to weekend flow mode because that’s what he knows. He’s been home the last 10 weeks with me and new baby. The magic of Christmas and making memories is down to me as mom. It all feels a little intimidating realizing that it feels like I always have to be a step ahead, on my A Game , getting up early, and planning ahead to be a good present mom who has the time play with my two little kids. It’s a constant crazy balancing act and if I’m not always on and going the systems fall apart. How are other moms handling this?? For reference we live in a very small old space and we cloth diaper and cloth paper towels to save money, no paper plates. So there is always laundry, dishes , always fighting old house smell, constant pick up due to no play room. Toys are in strategic bins all around our small house. submitted by /u/SMFKT_99_17_21 to r/CatholicWomen [link] [comments]",

In Persona 5 I guess this would translate to how much of the compendium could you fill via recruiting persona's and fusing them together before you send the calling card for each palace? I know technically it's possible to reach level 99 in kamoshida (o7 to YourBudTevin for the grind) so hypothetically is there ever a point in which you would run out of fusions to make only having the pool of kamoshida to work with from the start? submitted by /u/Alex_Drewskie to r/Persona5 [link] [comments]",

      "content": "I’m looking to get a fitting at club champion (due to gift card there specifically). Initially I was only planning to use the driver fitting in order to get shaft specs that fit my swing more. The current promo lets you use the fitting price as a credit towards a club. I have 3 year old fitted irons currently, but feel like I would benefit from a fitting as my handicap has dropped from a ~18 > 9 at this point. I’ve never had a driver/wood, hybrid, wedge, or putter fitting. The gift card I have is $180, enough for a driver fitting without the promotional sale ($50 if buying a custom club). The fitting price for a full bag, with the purchase of a new club, is $100. An idea I had was the use this promotional period to get a full bag fitting for “cheap”, and then use my $180 gift card to buy the cheapest club that would make me qualify for the promo. So my question to the community is, how much do you think the cheapest custom club purchase would be? I’ve read that they have all those extra costly fees like the build fee and the “puring” fee. I’m just trying to weigh the difference in pricing and whether to just use the gift card for a normal driver fitting without the discount and paying for a club, or taking advantage of the full bag fitting opportunity. TLDR- what’s the cheapest custom club purchase that I can make at club champion in order to take advantage of the full bag fitting promotion for $100 submitted by /u/Solid-Drop-2780 to r/golf [link] [comments]",

I know Mikan feels like she would be a waste of a survivor slot so if they were thinking of making her a survivor, I feel like they might have to make her more useful throughout the game and build more confidence for herself throughout the trials and potentially help our protagonist out as like a support of sorts In summary: Im PRAYING for mikan being a survivor but something is telling she might be a victim. leaning towards Survivor Most upvoted character gets to be talked about tomorrow Make your predictions for Mikan, too if you so please. submitted by /u/OneDragonfruit8042 to r/DanganAndChaos [link] [comments]",

A lot of speculation has surfaced about this ending, such as you needing a perfect performance to complete (or the complete opposite, a terrible performance), attempting to romance Malevola, or aceing every single hacking sequence (including the optional ones). I was wondering if anyone had tried just not choosing any responses when you're able? Not sure if anyone knew this, but if you let the decision timer run out, it just picks a decision for you, and though I haven't tested it, I think it might be possible this isn't random, which leads me to think a possible way to get the ending is literally do nothing.

This is the code. if ray.is_colliding(): if ray.get_collider() is TileMapLayer: var tile_map = ray.get_collider() var atlas_coord = tile_map.get_coords_for_body_rid(ray.get_collider_rid()) # atlas coords gets tile coordinates var tile_data = tile_map.get_cell_tile_data(atlas_coord) #gets all tiledata var custom_data_getter = null if tile_data != null: custom_data_getter = tile_data.get_custom_data(\"type\") #gets specific custom data print(custom_data_getter) else: print(tile_map) print(\"tile data null\") submitted by /u/IronShears [link] [comments]",

      "content": "In the mid-long term future, I plan to leave my job in a western studio and start a western-style indie PC games studio in Asia. Not sure what's a best investment until then, learning Chinese or Japanese (traveled to both). As for China: Future stability . Risk of war/economical-visa restrictions/ possible VPN law changes for the Great Firewall. Easier chinese visas, less starting capital required. Harder to get visa-free residency. But Japan's future leans right-wing and anti immigration. Content restrictions are only an issue if selling to the Chinese market (same restrictions for a company in the west selling to Chinese citizens). Much easier to hire/fire talent in China (bigger talent pool, applicants more open to small remote-first studios, lower cost of life/salaries, much much easier to fire a bad hire that would kill the company in a small japanese bootstrapped indie project). Japan talent pool has a worse demographic future. Worse opportunities for outside investment for games. I'm planning to bootstrap with savings, but don't want to close doors to future investment. Chinese publishers invest first in mobile/multiplayer (at least now), not my focus. Western publishers avoid Chinese companies due to worse intellectual property/legal protections. This is usually handled by keeping intellectual property and cash in an empty US Holding Company that outsources development to the Chinese one, but might be too much friction/risk for western investors. China is worse for selling the company. For a western publisher looking to acquire, even if the intellectual property is in the US holding company, it seems like a risk to buy a Chinese dev team that can go dark with a VPN law change. Long-term life/culture. China feels easier to integrate into. Prefer the bustle and hustle rather than the japanese zen with slow grind. Immigrants in Japan struggle to feel \"accepted\". Should I learn Chinese or Japanese during these previous years? China looks better for bootstrapped indies and lifestyle, Japan better for established/publisher focused big companies. submitted by /u/SavingClippy to r/AskAChinese [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Hey everyone! I'm trying to create a compositor effect in 4.5 that processes the color buffer based on stencil buffer values (doing custom highlight and outline effects). I've followed the 'The Compositor' tutorial in the docs, and got things set up the color buffer. So for the next step I've tried to add the depth buffer(1.) and it isn't going well. I thought I could follow the same pattern as using the color buffer in my shader. So in the glsl code I declare my buffer uniforms like so: layout(rgba16f, binding = 0, set = 0) uniform image2D color_tex; layout(rgba16f, binding = 1, set = 0) uniform image2D depth_tex; And in the script I fetch the buffers create uniforms/set as follows: var color_buffer = render_scene_buffers.get_color_layer(view) var color_uniform: RDUniform = RDUniform.new() color_uniform.uniform_type = RenderingDevice.UNIFORM_TYPE_IMAGE color_uniform.binding = 0 color_uniform.add_id(color_buffer) var depth_buffer = render_scene_buffers.get_depth_layer(view) var depth_uniform: RDUniform = RDUniform.new() depth_uniform.uniform_type = RenderingDevice.UNIFORM_TYPE_IMAGE depth_uniform.binding = 1 depth_uniform.add_id(depth_buffer) var uniform_set = UniformSetCacheRD.get_cache(shader, 0, [ color_uniform, depth_uniform ]) The shader compiles just fine. But when I run the script I get a few errors repeating every frame, the first one being ERROR: Image (binding: 1, index 0) needs the TEXTURE_USAGE_STORAGE_BIT usage flag set in order to be used as uniform. Now I'm not sure why I get this error for the depth buffer uniform and not the color buffer. I tried bitwise or'ing the TEXTURE_USAGE_STORAGE_BIT (so depth_uniform.uniform_type = RenderingDevice.UNIFORM_TYPE_IMAGE | TEXTURE_USAGE_STORAGE_BIT ), but that gave me an error stating that the uniform_type value was out of bounds. So I'm not really sure where I am going wrong. Clearly I am misunderstanding something. Is anyone able to point me in the right direction to figuring this out? submitted by /u/FernwehSmith [link] [comments]",

SFA is constantly insulting me and my intellect, so is the post-burn timeline which never should have picked up in another series. I see 2 options: either we come together and pull off some kind of blitzkrieg legal battle, which eventually forces Paramount (or whichever subsidiary is on charge right now) to never release another episode of that clusterfuck of emotional molestation. This might be hard to do, given the fact that they already dared to release 4 episodes, with a fifth one due for next week. Even if we hire the most slaughter-ready lawyers it might be to late to make them stop. The other more sane, more effective option would be to have someone on the inside who identifies all digital copies, production files and master images of that show and make them go away without a chance of restoration. This would need some kind of administrative access, and of course a person with lots of honor and selflessness. There are times when people are implored to act by their fellow civil brothers and sisters. This time is now. Only Paramount superusers can stop the destruction of our franchise. Yes if we delete all SFA copies now, there’d be still the 4 episodes floating around but they can always be considered to be a tragic example of selfish corporate media frenzy, an attack on fandom itself.

      "content": "I have run into a scenario on multiple occasions where players are informed ahead that my game is not easy. Not mechanically but I am going to delve into some pretty reprehensible topics. Vile darkness etc.... I always ask players to let me know what is off limits. I do not wish to make people uncomfortable as I have very few limits myself. Most my players are the limit. I have no issues with really abhorrent things if it's done for the right reasons and not just shock value (Though sometimes that is a good thing). I find myself running into too many players saying they have no limits then going. HEY! That's too far!. It's too far I get it. We won't pursue this. Why did you not tell me this before? It would not have come up? Does anyone else have this problem? I run games about violence and its consequences among other such things such as power dynamics. This shit is dark and I refuse to glorify it. Why can't people just be honest? So many problems can be avoided. I am not talking about the really obviously avoided things. It's the smaller stuff that is setting them off. Players if you have a problem with a topic and the GM and you are asked PLEASE be honest and say so that way it does not come up. I am not a fan of X-Cards or even doing these kinds of checks ins since people lie but I don't know what to do at this point. No one seems to have a problem until they do. When asked \"Why didn't you say I would have happily avoided it?\" They go this shit is disturbing why would you go there and I am like I am using it BECAUSE it's disturbing. I want to face this. All of my writing is very personal and my last game I wrote essentially consisted of a me writing about coping with suicidal ideation and moving through it and never say those words but the professional health workers I played with picked up on it immediately. Tell the DM if you can't handle the topic. Don't lie and say you can. Please... I know some times we thinkwe can but discover we cannot but I have heard too many times now. I didn't have a problem..... when it clearly was not true. submitted by /u/Forsaken-0ne to r/rpg [link] [comments]",

Bonus points for making her relevant in the NEXT patch, thus making this argument kind of obsolete. What if they randomly decided to give Vivian a swimsuit skin in OCTOBER, but NOT Miyabi, who as an ice character would (probably) be able to resist the cold. Bonus points if they acknowledge the fact that it was weird for them to do that since it was no longer summer time. What if they gave literal NPCs, characters that you literally CAN'T PLAY AS and thus won't be able to see as much, a skin, but NOT the VERY playable Hoshimi Miyabi. Bonus for giving them to NPCs that are actually popular, which would give this point less traction. What if they gave PAN FUCKING YINHU, a character who probably has like 5 fans, a skin, but NOT Miyabi, who is one of if not the MOST popular character in the game.

All for at best a 5% chance per TOUR to get an Australium Weapon. Yareli (Warframe). Yareli was a Warframe in the game that while not necessarily optimal, was very fashionable and unique. How do you get it? By completing an hours long quest line requiring you to perform extremly difficult tricks on a K-Drive, a rather Niche mechanic that (up until then), no one had any reason to use. I heard that it was made much easier, but I still will never get back the hours I spent on that quest. Characters in any any HoyoVerse game. The characters in all hoyoverse games often have very unique character designs, backstories, and great voice actors. However, to get these characters you either have to spend absurd amounts of money, or grind the most tedious, insanity inducing tasks for weeks on end to save up enough of whatever in-game currency to get any reasonable chance of getting ONE character. This is completely ignoring all the things you have to do to make the character optimal, which requires more grinding and oftentimes spending even more on gacha to get the character's weapons and other characters for good team composition. submitted by /u/WHATISREDDIT7890 to r/TopCharacterTropes [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Hello, As the title says, I want to start working on making HDR content. I know OLED is king for HDR but it lacks brightness to master high brightness scenes. On the other hand Mini Led tech offers high brightness and no issues for burn in but they're a bit more finicky to get one working correctly. Is brightness important at all for master high brightness scenes? Or the contrast and ease of use of OLED better? Thanks! submitted by /u/Accomplished-Ride119 [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Now they’ve even removed Weidian links, which makes things worse. On top of that, a lot of Taobao or Alibaba links either bug out or don’t show up at all, and even tracking and QC pics have been hit or miss. It’s getting pretty frustrating to deal with. I decided to try Hipobuy after their recent site update, and it’s actually way more convenient than I expected. You can use cnfans links directly on Hipobuy without converting them, and cnfans spreadsheets seem to work fine too. The whole site just feels smoother and more reliable overall. They also brought back 30% off shipping coupons, which is nice. On top of that, if you forward your packages from the cnfans warehouse to Hipobuy, they pay for your domestic shipping, which is kind of crazy. I haven’t really seen another agent offer something like that before. With all the issues going on with cnfans, switching to Hipobuy honestly feels like the logical move at this point. Has anyone else tried Hipobuy yet, or been running into the same problems with cnfans? submitted by /u/an-intelectual-being to r/RepVirgins [link] [comments]",

Use NordVPN normally for up to 30 days. If you don’t want to keep it, just request a refund & they process it without hassle. That’s how people are getting both the lowest price and a risk free trial. I wasn’t sure at first, but I tried it myself and it worked fine. Important Note: Skip “coupon code” sites.

Pretty much just fill my deck with empty fields and then Agronomist Tae-Eon gives me bread every time I use an empty field, plus I harvest the wheat and I have like over 30 bread in a week or two. I feel I'm missing out on the whole gameplay structure because of this card imbalancing the play towards using empty fields. Will this sort itself out? Does everyone have this card?

This also allows them to leave the dark world and enter different ones without turning to stone, and it works like yinyang, the knight is yin, and ralsei is yang (alot of people make the mistakr of thinking that yin is the white). This theory is also very anti-papyrus knight. submitted by /u/Lucky_Rice8262 to r/Deltarune [link] [comments]",

Ive tried running the game as an administrator, but the game refuses to launch when I do that. There's no fixing it. My computer is fully capable of running STALKER 2.

      "content": "Some time ago I brought my plan for a Pokémon Fanfic, and I'm here to talk about another topic. I'll leave the link to the post for you to read. This time I want to say that I intend to adapt the two Pokémon Legends games, and I wanted to show my proposals. Legends Arceus: The story will tell the origin of the Fujiwara Family, and of the one who started it all, Christopher Fujiwara. He was a character of unknown origin who was chosen by Arceus and as a bonus received a natural gift for Aura, something that his descendants would inherit and improve. And in the future it is revealed that Christopher married Akari. Legends ZA: This one is still in the planning phase, but the biggest difference is that the game will take place 20 to 25 years after XY, to show my characters older, married and with children, including my OCs, and the protagonists being precisely those children. But it's also an idea that I might apply to the Tenth Region, but that may depend a lot on how it turns out. Soon I intend to make a post talking about the love interests of my OCs, but for now I would like to know what you thought of these ideas for the Legends Saga. submitted by /u/UsualWishbone4416 to r/pokemonfanfiction [link] [comments]",

      "content": "About three years ago I was making a music video and found I really liked environmental storytelling and world building. I decided my next project would be a video game. Since I already had quite a bit of experience in Blender and virtually none in any game engines I decided I’d figure out a development approach that lets me do most of the heavy-lifting in Blender. That’s how I ended up with a game that is 90% pre-rendered. The overworld backgrounds, the cutscenes and even the turn-based combat is all pre-rendered. It’s a bit of a nightmare to work with at times but I’m really happy with the result. The way I’d describe the game itself is a mix of Disco Elysium, Fear and Hunger, Look Outside and Bioshock. For the Disco Elysium inspiration, I wanted to create a world that felt truly lived-in with lively dynamic characters who are shaped by the world they inhabit. It also has a similar system for handling skill checks and there being multiple solutions to quests. For Fear and Hunger and Look Outside, this is the exploration, scavenging and combat elements of the game. I was especially inspired by the unique encounter design in Look Outside. Bioshock is a huge inspiration for the setting. I’ve wanted more games set in doomed underwater cities so I decided to go out and make my own.

I know that RigidBody3D can do so via collision with Area3D, but I want to make it independent , so I can stick my character to any wall I want. I thought about this kind of a solution: When change-gravity-button is pressed, a collision sphere gets first collision and its normal and sends it to gravity component, where it then interpolates character global position to collision point global position, counts difference between floor and character in angles and rotates it so player is perpendicular to the floor, and whenever we change walking surface the algorithm repeats submitted by /u/murdered_ronin [link] [comments]",

      "content": "I had an experience in Warzone that honestly crossed a line for me, and I think this is something the developers need to look at from a design perspective. A player used the hostage/carry mechanic in a way that visually resembled a sexual assault scenario, undeniably. I know the intent of the mechanic is tactical and gameplay-driven, but the way character models animate and how players can position themselves makes it very easy for someone to create something that looks extremely disturbing and inappropriate. Player downed me, took me hostage and took me to the corner of the wall simulating rape action. It triggered my PTSD! This isn’t about trash talk or normal toxicity — this is about how a gameplay animation can be misused to simulate something horrific. It caught me off guard and genuinely made me uncomfortable. I’m not blaming the game for player behavior, but I do think this is an unintended visual outcome of the mechanic that should be reviewed. Small animation or positioning restrictions could prevent this from happening without affecting gameplay. Has anyone else seen this? And how can we get this in front of the devs so they can adjust the mechanic? I’ve reported the player, but I think this is a design oversight that deserves attention. submitted by /u/Aggressive_Bill_2822 to r/Warzone [link] [comments]",

We enjoy disc golfing, video/board/card games and having mellow get togethers. I work in a hospital setting and he is retired army/stay at home dad. Our son loves to be outside and go to parks and the Washington Pavillion. We also have a corgi who loves other dogs and is always happy to romp around!

I haven’t shipped anything yet (partly for this reason) and can’t speak from experience, so I’d love to hear from people who actually have. If you’re a solo dev, what’s your day job? How do you manage financially while working on your games? For you, is game dev a side hustle/ hobby, or are you trying to make it full time? I’m especially curious to hear from devs with a coding or software background like mine, though all experiences are welcome. Honest answers are really appreciated. submitted by /u/nauman_arshad [link] [comments]",

Funnily enough, doing so spoiled a big twist in the story: those guys were bandits and captured the real Jaromier! With everyone dead, I’m free to roam about and find all the clues like how they have weapons and armor stocked and even a Leipa shield (so they must be the same bandits who ambushed us at the start?), and you even get to chat with Jaromier in the dungeons to learn the full story. I feel like I accidentally advanced the plot by a couple hours and I noticed the killing spree will take a huge toll on your reputation: it makes no sense because those are bandits! And even after you wipe out everyone and returned to Trosky, you still have to go back and attack the fortress…..even though I already killed everyone?

It's a really cool feeling getting to enjoy a game and realizing that it's something you made yourself and any ideas you have can be implemented.

I had some fun talks, made some good trades and just feel good for once :) Im making a super tasty pizza right now and Im gonna play some games in a few hours+ a movie night with my best friend.

      "content": "I'm relatively new to game dev having picked it up as a hobby about 1.5 years ago, and while building small games for jams and mini projects that took 1-2 months, I enjoyed the process of making each game but ultimately I didn't play the games much once the project was done. For the last year and a bit, I shifted into working on a major project and I am finding that instead of playing the game to look for bugs/improvements, I have been playing for the high score/ to experiment with builds and just for fun generally. It's a really cool feeling getting to enjoy a game and realizing that it's something you made yourself and any ideas you have can be implemented. I've never experienced something like it before and I'm wondering if this feeling stays after you release your games or if this is a feeling that is consistent with every major project you work on? submitted by /u/BeesAreCoolAlsoAnts to r/gamedev [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Hi everyone. I’ve been working for quite a while on a platform called Homespace ( https://store.steampowered.com/app/2508170/Homespace/ ). The core idea is that players build virtual homes and then play mini-games inside them. Recently, I decided to make a key focus of the project the idea that Unreal Engine developers could create their own mini-games, publish them, and sell them within our platform. It seems to me that creating mini-games is much easier than developing full-fledged games — even small indie ones — and if we already have an audience, this could be a very low-barrier entry point for developers. Moreover, we could provide an additional source of income for level and mini-game creators. And on a broader level, even if hardcore Unreal developers aren’t particularly interested, we’d still be lowering the entry barrier to game development for regular users — encouraging them to start experimenting with Unreal and even coding if they want to do so within our ecosystem. What do you think about this idea? Am I right in this assumption, and does it make sense to implement something like this at all? submitted by /u/General-Lock-1079 [link] [comments]",

I can go to Switch Menu, but the game just freezes. Even turning second controller off the game doesnt respond and simply crash with a software error after 5 minutes. We really loved the game but this is pretty disappointing. Maybe the devs can reaply to a solution? This started to happen when we was doind the third bishop route.

After I conquered my video game addiction in my mid teens and started actually socialising they were dissappointed in me and continued to pressure me to do IT courses which I hated. I told my father that he basically enabled my video game addiction which ruined my childhood and early teens and yet hes still in denial. Well at least I actually did became a video editor/camereman at a local TV station but obviously the pay isnt as great as software devs but I'm happy and I get to meet interesting people, also being an attractive man sorrounded by mostly female colleagues feels great to say the least, haha.

Adding a Club Chat feature would be a game-changer for community building. It keeps us in the game longer and makes the \"team\" aspect feel real. Right now, it’s hard to build any plan tactics with club members. Adding a dedicated chat space would help players mentor each other and stay active. It’s the one missing piece to making clubs feel like a true community rather than just a list of names. Any chance this is on the roadmap?

If a Magician is shot while deflecting, the bullet will be deflected back at the shooter and deal damage! This makes it great for deterring the aggressive playstyle of the Mule, and can create strong opportunities to get a free reload off when down in the count. I'm super excited to keep showing off more of the game when the time is right. I've put a lot of heart into this game, so I want to make sure I give it a proper launch. 😁 Let me know if you have any other class ideas you think would be cool to see in game! submitted by /u/Calm_Salamander_2447 to r/rblxoutlaws [link] [comments]",

It's a horrible map in that regard. I avoid it. Your modding community has shown more love and care for the game than you do. You just rake in the money and let them make the game for you. You should be ashamed of yourselves. Genuinely consider giving the game to the modding community. You clearly have done so in a less literal sense. You take suggestions(which are insanely easy to code and take little to no effort), and put them \"under consideration\" for years. It's depressing. Please get your s*** together. I've never had this many issues with a game in my LIFE. Not even THE SIMS 2 ON A MODERN PC has given me this many issues. It's easier to reinstall the Sims 2 from the ground up than to run POT.

For the card game, I used opposing and matching elements instead of numbers. There's also a round element, and whoever has the most of that element's icon on the board at the end of the round gets a bonus. Tried to make it as self-explanatory as I could while still providing multiple avenues for points and victories.

      "content": "Hello everyone! I am a bit new to unity and following some tutorials I tried to instantiate the game object with 3d model and particle system as children. I needed to destroy the object but to leave the PS for all of the particles to die beforehand. I tried destroying the model first, and then particle system, however it was not possible because while trying to destroy the children of cloned object I got an error telling me that I am trying do destroy prefabs. But doing so with the parent object (which was instantiated) works. I tried unparenting the PS as the tutorial showed, using transform.parent = null. But the error popped up saying the parrent cannot be null. I will try to just make two separate objects one with model and one with particle system and instantiate them. But it feels a bit clanky? Is there any other solution and am I missing something? Thanks in advance :) P.s.

In the winter, instead of the power station, I connect the LED lights directly to the truck’s starter battery using an always-hot cigarette outlet that I installed in the truck bed. With this setup, I’m not getting any power to the lights, and I’m not sure why. I know the cigarette outlet itself works because I use it to charge my portable power station. That makes me think the issue is either: • a voltage incompatibility, or. • the cable I’m using to connect the LED lights to the outlet. The LEDs are connected using a 5.5 × 2.1 mm (5521) to male cigarette lighter cable. This cable works in other setups and outlets, but I’m wondering if there’s something about this specific outlet, connection, or voltage that’s preventing the lights from powering on.

Here are their \"specs\": ---- -Vernia Female Figther (level 21) Calm Inclination Skills: Burst Strike, Cloudward Slash, Hindsight Sweep, Full Moon Slash ID: 7RHJ1Z18M2H4 ---- -Baenlin Male Mage (level 20) Kindhearted Inclination Skills: High Halidom, High Celerity, High Palladium, Lightning Affinity ID: JLC5D7QYUXX4 (Vermundian mages usually only cast Flagration and Fire Boon, but I don't think that would make a very fun pawn to have around, so I gave him some different skills). ---- If anyone fancies having some Vermundian soldiers for pawns, here they are. In case you hire any of them, hope it's to your liking! I also want to, eventually, create an Archer Vermundian Pawn, but creating these, even with the help of a late game safe file, is a bit time consuming, so maybe an idea for another time.

I'm talking about youtube content creators that play tons of games and highlight the best parts. They have not only a love for playing games, that many of us do, but also of sharing and building community around it. They are a crucial part for games to get out there in hands of people that may like them. When I reached out to them, they were more than helpful, kind and appreciative. Here is a list of some I came to know in these last 6 months: https://www.youtube.com/@MissChiefVR/videos https://www.youtube.com/@Mets.ta.Quest-FrOgZ https://www.youtube.com/@DiscoVRTetiana https://www.youtube.com/@fornixVR https://www.youtube.com/@POWERGIRLBE https://www.youtube.com/@vrsus-official https://www.youtube.com/@JyunVR https://www.youtube.com/@MickManchester . https://www.youtube.com/@richardclarkeade https://www.youtube.com/@projektvr Do you share similar experience?

Now normally I wouldnt even be mad and sad cuz it's just a game, but those pets were all gifts that my girlfriend made to me. She sacrificed many pets in her account, even things she loved Just for getting me some pets i likes. And now, all my pets, all her sacrifices: GONE. I dont even know this guy/girl. I dont even remember playing with him in a server. I dont even wake up at 6 AM, I wake up a 7 AM. Now i feel mad, and sad, and most of all, i feel like i broke a promise, and despite all the times She told me \"it's not your fault\", i still think it's my fault. Maybe if i decided to login earlier something would've changed. Maybe if i decided to transfer my pets to another account this could've been avoided. I Hope that my report will be seen and that this story will be ready, and that this scum of a human being Will be banned, over and over and over and over and over. Thank you for your time. -Qbic (AKA Fakeranni) (NOTE: I never asked her for pets, She just gave them to me, not even knowing if i wanted them or not, and this makes me even more mad.

      "content": "There seems to be an obsession with adding online multiplayer to every game. At this point, it feels like every game is expected to have online features, but honestly, I think a lot of players struggle to find people to play with, and many of us don’t want to sit in a lobby listening to a horde of screaming kids. Making VR games is already difficult for indie devs, and supporting online multiplayer makes it even harder, and most importantly, it often results in less overall content. I could give many examples, but take Battle Talent for instance. It’s one of my favorite VR games: it has tons of systems, lots of enemy types, lots of weapons, etc. The devs have been pushing updates for a long time, which is great, and those updates are genuinely impressive. But over the past year they’ve been focusing heavily on online features, and personally I lost interest, while still thinking adding more core content could really transform this indie title into something totally unmatched in VR. Another example is Undead Citadel, which had a relatively lukewarm launch. Many people were disappointed by the amount of contents (not the gameplay itself), and now it looks like the team is working on a “multiplayer update.” Honestly, I just hope they add more than multiplayer (and from what I’ve seen, it seems they will). Online play, sandbox modes, mod support… all of that is nice to have. But to me, it’s more like the icing on the cake, not the cake itself. How do you guys feel? Is it just me coping because I have no friends, or do you also miss content-heavy single-player games? submitted by /u/Enculin to r/VRGaming [link] [comments]",

I'd like to avoid this. My first instinct would be to put an underscore before the parameter, e.g.: func _init(_character: Character) -> void: character = _character But, using an underscore on a parameter is the indicator to Godot to ignore unused parameters... so I don't want to use an underscore here. My next instinct would be to put a $ before the parameter, e.g.: ``` This is NOT valid code func _init($character: Character) -> void: character = $character ``` But $ have a special meaning in Godot and are not valid characters in a parameter name. Unfortunately, the official style guide also doesn't mention anything about this. Anyone have any clever, clean, universal approaches to this problem? submitted by /u/samanime [link] [comments]",

      "content": "I’ve always found this take that Luka would have multiple rings if he was on the Celtics to be flawed for many reasons: Preventing player development: Luka Doncic, a player that’s very ball dominant would likely mean the Celtics guard duo of Derrick White and Payton Pritchard wouldn’t have been able to develop into the players they are today because of Luka’s usage rate. Defensive liability: The Celtics built their championship team around the idea that their starting 5 players could switch onto an opposing player and defend them to a decent degree. With Luka on the court teams would have an immediate weak link to hunt on offense. Disrupts the Celtics balanced attack: The Celtics championship run consisted of multiple players that could get 20 points a game and with Luka’s usage you would’ve definitely seen less games where Porzingis or Jrue would’ve been able to showcase their offensive talent. It would’ve also made the five-out offense less reliable as most of the three-point shot attempts would be coming from one guy making the Celtics a more predictable team. This is further shown by the struggles he had playing with Porzingis. Similarly, would Jalen Brunson take the jump to the next level if he was still playing with the mavericks and Luka. This is not me arguing that Jayson Tatum could’ve taken Luka’s 2024 mavericks to the finals but I believe people often try to use this argument to prove that one player only wins because of their roster rather than understand how a player is able to fit and adapt to a system which matters more in determining the success they’d have on that team. submitted by /u/Majestic-Web-367 to r/NBATalk [link] [comments]",

However, I just realized I could no find my game on Steam by searching it. Then, I found out the Steam support assistant entered a wrong name for me (one more \"l\" in the word \"Duelist\")which is really heartbreaking. It is not easy to have a good view post and viewers could not even search my game successfully Game developers have always dedicated themselves to making the game they love. One game might change everything. I really hope all the gaming platforms could treat developers and gamers well.

Anytime I try to go lower than 16px or I scale it down, text just becomes jumbled up and unreadable.

That’s insane. The little fuckers are impossible because only dismemberment seems to do the job, but given most weapons at man-at-arms and above are focussed on bludgeoning - this becomes an absolute chore. Not to mention even when all their bones are broken and they’re just lying there, they still don’t count as a kill, even if they can’t get up or do anything. This, on top of the fact that the larger weapons all feel like wiffle bats and are terrible at cutting now - makes the abyss by far the worst part of the game. What are your opinions on the abyss?

You can use cnfans links directly on Hipobuy without converting them, and cnfans spreadsheets seem to work fine too. The whole site just feels smoother and more reliable overall. They also brought back 30% off shipping coupons, which is nice. On top of that, if you forward your packages from the cnfans warehouse to Hipobuy, they pay for your domestic shipping, which is kind of crazy.

      "content": "In episode 16 of Gnosia, Remnan worries about being caught running away unlawfully and being captured if the D.Q.O. goes to a base. I've finished the game too, so I know that in it, his concern is rather about having to \"see\" someone. I'm curious about any theories/reasoning for the reasons for his concern in the anime. Is running away unlawfully really that big of a concern? Even if he left a planet without going through the correct process, this is because he escaped slavery. Wouldn't an exception be made? Or is he simply worried about the process of having to clarify this? Alternatively, if he ran away illegally, this could imply that slavery is legal in Gnosia, or has different legalities depending on the planet. However, I always figured Manan kept Remnan secret from anyone outside of her trusted circle. In the game, his worry about having to see someone is very vague, but from his events and general demeanor, the player is naturally made to think about Manan. It would make sense that, if he reported to a military base, she could possibly find out and track him down, at least in his POV. What do you all think? I'm open to discussion regarding this. Either way, it was nice to finally have a Remnan and Raqio moment adapted to the anime. submitted by /u/proboty to r/Gnosia_ [link] [comments]",

So my advice: don't you ever compare your (still unfinished game) to other games. submitted by /u/Dream-Unable [link] [comments]",

No matter what settings I use there's this ghosting on the item I'm holding and everything becomes blurry whenever I move and it's making me dizzy and hurting my eyes. The only time the ghosting and blur when moving is gone is when I use FXAA. But now I have a new problem where everything is too sharp. The clip I uploaded is just me showing the blur and ghosting I'm talking about but I've tried doing dlss on and off, full screen, windowed etc. I tried limiting fps, turning the motion blur on and off, global illumination on and off, going from low to ultra settings. But nothing changes. It's still blurry and has that ghosting effect except for when I use fxaa which makes everything too sharp and still makes my eyes hurt. Outside the settings I've also tried the compatability mode I've seen people suggesting in the forums but still it has this same effect. I tried searching for solutions but not much people seem to be having the same issues as me. Thank you for the help in advance.

But it's honestly really difficult because a lot of the time, the experience for me is teammates going \"I wanna make this game I've had as an idea for years\" months or whatever. While that's fine, I don't really think a game jam is the place to do that. Especially before the theme is even announced. I find this to be very frustrating as it introduces a lot of scope creep and can cause you to fixate on a \"dream game\" that may not even be that great or related to the theme. To me, making a game for a game jam is about a fresh idea, that's short and sweet. Not system heavy and full of unfinished ideas. Maybe I'm being an ass, I don't know. I'm also not confrontational, so I'm not going \"Let's not do this, let's focus on finishing something then adding 'flavor' to it afterwards.\" It's just everytime, I regret not working solo. submitted by /u/Same_Bar4349 [link] [comments]",

I'm currently making a pool game and I'm trying to make it so that the game will show your ball's trajectory, and if it collided with a ball it'll show the direction of where the hit ball would go. Originally I tried getting the direction like this but it wasn't super accurate var target_direction = (hit_position - self.global_position).normalized() bounce_line_2d.add_point(collider.global_position) bounce_line_2d.add_point(hit_position + target_direction * 200) Using the normal is closer but still inaccurate if shape_cast_2d.is_colliding(): var hit_position = shape_cast_2d.get_collision_point(0) var normal = shape_cast_2d.get_collision_normal(0) var collider = shape_cast_2d.get_collider(0) trajectory_line_2d.add_point(self.global_position) trajectory_line_2d.add_point(hit_position) collision_preview.global_position = hit_position collision_preview.visible = true if collider.is_in_group(\"balls\"): var target_direction = -normal bounce_line_2d.add_point(collider.global_position) bounce_line_2d.add_point(collider.global_position + target_direction * 200) The balls are rigid bodies and to detect collision im using a shape cast that's the same size as the ball.

      "content": "Hi Guys, I’ve been working on an Ninjago watch order that puts all Ninjago episodes and shorts into one complete timeline. The goal was to make it as clear and easy as possible to watch everything in the right order, without missing any extra content or shorts. The watch order is still a work in progress , so not every episode has a link yet, but I’m updating it over time. There are no ILLEGAL links included — everything is sourced directly from YouTube only. I figured I’d share it in case other Ninjago fans find it useful. Hope it helps, and feel free to check it out! link to the document: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Tr9XLEIn0MXcHh7senRLlD4fe5xr_sNWBgNhRzmAKdI/edit?tab=t.0 submitted by /u/dwilizo to u/dwilizo [link] [comments]",

      "content": "This is still incredibly disappointing to me it's come to this, I had so much hopes and expectations for this game and I'm sure so many other people did too but unlike me and some other people, most people gave up on the game shortly after playing it alittle bit most likely because they realized they didn't want to spend as much time in the game as they'd have to to get where they want, I didn't view this as a problem but the game started dying out active playerbase wise pretty soon after it came out because of various reasons of people not wanting to play the game but the game was still being profitable for a little bit, I feel like if the game had ANY advertisements made for the game at all in terms of ads and marketing the game then things would've never came to this but clearly the devs and Crunchyroll don't care about that and they never actually wanted this game to live or survive, if they did actually have any plans or wants with this game other than to use it as a cash grab then they'd not be doing an EOS and they'd be trying to make the game profitable rather than just saying \"eh it's not profitable so we have to close it\" the game had amazing game play, graphics, mechanics, the gacha system is ass but at least you could technically still earn everything for free it's just probability based. There are plenty of things they could do or could've done to prevent this but it's more than obvious they had no intentions of saving this game otherwise we'd have seen that effort. submitted by /u/PhotosByZane to r/OnePunchManWorldGame [link] [comments]",

      "content": "I've been wanting to bring this up for a while now to add some positivity into this sub The thing is, even with all the \"Yakuza is so over\" stuff and SEGA & RGG Studio doing everything they can to ruin the franchise with their business and artistic choices, I still consider Yakuza the best franchise for me personally and one of the best franchises overall. Frankly, I don't see any other game series that would be so good and so frequent with their releases (although frequent releases arguably became an issue lately, but still) You may consider it a toxic positivity, but I'm aware of all the flaws of the series for the past six or so months, and I don't like any of that as well. It's just that RGG Studio is still the best dev team in my eyes, as they have set the bar quite high, hence I'm still excited for new releases How do you feel about Yakuza series regardless of its state right now? Is it really so over for you, or do you share the same feelings? submitted by /u/NetRetro to r/yakuzagames [link] [comments]",

However I noticed with the \"process call : physics\" my character was not having problems but the other elements moving (the cars in this case) were jittering a little when my character (thus the camera) were moving. When I put the process call to Idle, my character was jittering since I use the physics process, but the cars werent. Is there a way to fix the issue other than using physics process on the cars since they don't really need physics ?

      "content": "Idk who needs to hear this but: I know we all roll our eyes at the “I can fix him” thing when it comes to women trying to rehabilitate toxic men, but I think a lot of us are still susceptible to the notion that if we just love our female or nb partners hard enough they will finally, eventually treat us right. …Sorry to say but, they probably won’t. If your partner consistently does things that hurt you or make you feel insecure or undervalued, *love will not change them.* If your gut tells you they’re maybe just kind of with you until they find someone “better,” you cannot love them into loving you fully. If they rant to you about how horrible all their ex partners & friends are — *you are not a break in the cycle, you’re just on the next loop-de-loop* — If it’s that many people, it’s not their exes, it’s not you: it’s them. I know we all want to believe that people can change, and trust me - I know how difficult it is to cut the cord when someone alternates hurtful behavior with lovebombing - when you keep seeing flashes of the person you wish they’d be. That’s often enough to keep people trapped in bad relationships for years. But if any part of this resonates with you, please try to take it to heart that you deserve better. You have to be a kind and patient person in order to want to help “fix” a broken person, but you may be breaking yourself in the process without even realizing it. You’re not a bad person for walking away from a toxic situation. I promise there is a better relationship out there, with someone who will actually appreciate and return the love and kindness you are currently pouring into ((whoever they are)) submitted by /u/uta_refson to r/actuallesbians [link] [comments]",

This is what happens when you grew up in 80s NYC clubs: Area, The Tunnel, Visage, The Palladium - - - and you refuse to settle for algorithmic bullshit. This is me spanning 50 YEARS of music (yes, fifty) because I'm genre agnostic and I don't care what decade it came from if it makes me FEEL like a woman, not a demographic. You won't find force-fed \"empowerment anthems\" here, no drunk-girl-screaming playlist everyone makes, nothing that sounds like it came from a focus group. What you WILL find is Blondie's \"Call Me\" from 1980 sitting right next to Peggy Gou's \"(It Goes Like) Nanana\" from 2023. You'll find Basia -- BASIA, because who the heck remembers her? I do. You'll find Laufey's \"From The Start\" making you swoon before Purple Disco Machine makes you move. Grace Jones, Donna Summer, CHIC—the queens who taught the game. WAR and Earth, Wind & Fire because sometimes you need funk, not feelings. Chappell Roan and RAYE because good music doesn't have an expiration date. This playlist is for the women who know that Fleetwood Mac's \"Everywhere\" from 1987 still hits you different every time, who can dance to Sheila B. Devotion's French disco , who appreciate that Lianne La Havas and Jessie Ware exist, who remember when Madonna made music that mattered, who understand that Dua Lipa's \"Levitating\" belongs right next to Michael Jackson's \"Rock With You.\" This isn't a nostalgia trip and it's not a \"new music\" playlist.

I think white gold is so stunning on its own but it seems like the standard is to add the rhodium to make it look more like platinum. The plating on my 14k white gold engagement ring has been wearing off and I love the look of it even more now than the day I got it! Also wondering if there is a way to safely speed up the wear of the plating without damaging the stones (lab diamonds) and the metal underneath? submitted by /u/Superb_Watch_2166 to r/askjewelers [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Greetings, I am a big fan of wargaming and enjoy Kriegsspiel etc, I have not played an actual tabletop war game in a long time and do not have the largest space to play. I am wanting to play something that isn't the lightest wargame in the world but would be alright for someone interested in strategy but new to the concept. I really want to get 2 sets of travel battle and combine them to make a 40 inch length 10 inch depth field of battle, since it works for my space. My question is, I understand that the native rulesets are very light, and that it is the rules that really make the war game and not the pieces. What, if any, are good, but not grognard complex, rulesets appliable to travel battle and this scale? (Brigade level, 32 total infantry blocks, 6 total cavalry blocks, 4 total arty blocks). https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXZcEK4VDXA submitted by /u/SimplyAquaticArt to r/wargaming [link] [comments]",
