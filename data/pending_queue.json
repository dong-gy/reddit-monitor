I would love to hear your honest feedback—positive or negative— please leave a review on Steam if you have a moment! It helps me tremendously in improving the final game. Also, if you run into any specific bugs, feel free to reach out to me directly on Discord.

Because of the nausea, NOTHING sounds appetizing to me. If I try and eat rice crackers to fill my stomach, I find myself randomly getting sick mid chew. I just threw up at work yesterday after a wave of nausea hit me after some apple sauce. By mid day, I am STARVING. Like my body is shutting down starving. I force myself to eat something that I can chew without wanting to gag, and find that I still feel starving!!! Last night, I went and got pasta for dinner. I only was able to eat a small amount before I felt extremely full, however I still felt HUNGRY. Basically, nothing sounds good, and when I do eat, I don't feel satisfied. It's driving me a little crazy, as I work 8:30-6:30 pm right now and have an hour commute both ways to work. It's really making me feel miserable. I have anti-acids when I need and morning sickness gummies with ginger and b6 (I also take vitamin D and B every night with my fish oil, prenatal, and iron supplement) but nothing seems to help. I've been underweight my entire life, so I'm a small gal. But I can't bear to lose weight right now when I should be eating at least a full days calories...but I just can't.

It was because I had keyboard with pressure sensor. After pressing buttons on keyboard in gamepad mode game finally recognized some (not all) inputs from controller. So if you have similar problem try disable all you other controller devices in device manager or unplug them because game seems to have problem when you have few simultaneously.

Please keep in mind that the full game will feature a much deeper story, more complex mechanics, and various puzzles that aren't in the demo yet. As a solo developer, I’m still working hard on bug fixes and optimization . You might encounter some rough edges, and I truly appreciate your patience. I would love to hear your honest feedback—positive or negative— please leave a review on Steam if you have a moment! It helps me tremendously in improving the final game. Also, if you run into any specific bugs, feel free to reach out to me directly on Discord. You can play the demo here: Store Page Late Lines FM Discord Server: Discord If you enjoy the atmosphere, adding the game to your wishlist would be a huge help. Thank you for your support! 😊 submitted by /u/AlarmedPumpkin8446 [link] [comments]",

I found that the best way to make my hand drawn sprites look the best is by drawing a small one (goblin) at 256x256 down scaling it to 128x128 in gimp and then importing it to Godot where I zoom out with the camera to make it smaller on the screen. This was after 4 hours of research and testing stuff out. Then for an ogre I would make it at 512x512 and put it down to 256x256. Is this the best practice for getting art into my game, then making it small but still keep it look not pixelated and blurry. I first tried just making the sprites 20x20 but that made it super ugly. I am using a 1280x720 res. Any other tips on import settings/project settings are appreciated! submitted by /u/preppypenguingames [link] [comments]",

Great at listening to what we wanted. One thing I still noticed hasn’t changed is the upgrade price. At level one hundred it would cost me 100 thousand gold to upgrade from a purple to pink. I’m already picking up pink and can craft it. It’s not like I’m crafting something I can’t. It makes it such a useless mechanic and it is in theory a great add on. Especially with the fact you get plenty of crafting material without having to farm on the slightest. I remember when the upgrade mechanic first dropped to go from brown to gold for something in the upper end of leveling, around 300, was like 15 million gold. These prices don’t equate to what you are receiving. I know nothing is going to be changed, but I have never used the upgrade deal and never will. Still a great game.

Problem is that adding Nav Obstacles to towers and placing them doesn't seem to work. I've done a little research and it seems that Nav Obstacles don't work with tilemap layers. Is there anyway I could do this without having to add a navigation region to each path? Each path is made for one map so I'd rather not have to do anything that requires me to draw a path and then draw a navigation region afterwards... but tbh I'm clueless as to what else to do :/ Of course my enemies use NavigationAgent, I'm new to Godot so I'm not sure what the norm for pathfinding really is, I assume it's good XD submitted by /u/Physical_Metal6063 [link] [comments]",

I've played some single player games, but I completely lost interest in gaming recently, as new games feel more like movies with too long cutscenes and not actually experiencing the story through gameplay, and thus games feel dull to me. I've bought kindle 3 months ago, and feel like, I've used kindle more purposefully than desktop PC I've build year ago. I don't want to watch 10 mins cutscenes to have any idea what's happening in game , I could just watch Netflix. Does anyone relate ? I have this rtx3060 on 1080p (144hz) monitor, which I understand, people say is low (budget) end (intel i5-12400F , H610M-K D4, 32gb ram). Which I feel like GPU won't be used much because there's no new games that interest me at all. I always thought it would be great, but I just open chrome. In fact I could reinstall to chromeOS Flex, and I wouldn't feel the difference. I just notice it now (bc I never had PC to my ownership 😂). I feel like smartphone and laptop already killed desktop long time ago. Desktop is just a for gamers or work professionals.

      "content": "I've always thought about this, a goal that ties the game with 2 minutes left feels way more important than scoring the 6th goal in a blowout. But they count exactly the same in the stats. While on parental leave I started to vibe code this small site which weights points based on game situation. Everything was done during naptime, no kids were harmed :) https://clutchpuck.com Tying goals and go-ahead goals count more. Garbage time goals count less. Empty netters are basically worth little. Shorthanded goals get a bump etc. Adrian Kempe, Kevin Fiala and Tyler Bertuzzi rise the most on the standings. Biggest \"garbage time\" players are Glaude Giroux, Quinn Hughes, John Carlson. Cole Caufield rises +20 positions (from 29th to 9th). Curious if anyone else has thought about this or has further ideas on how the weights should work? You can also adjust the weights yourself if those seem too low or high. Clicking the player name will open up further information. https://preview.redd.it/3rsk1szwjzeg1.png?width=2590&format=png&auto=webp&s=871cba4dadf7e23080606bd79f4476864390cebf submitted by /u/valstu to r/hockey [link] [comments]",

      "content": "so a long time ago on Roblox there was a game I played called warrior cats: Forest territory. to me this was like my comfort game or somthing I would get on and play with a bunch of random people who actually wanted to talk to me and hear my thoughts and ideas during that time not a lot of people I knew in real life wanted to talk to me much so forest territory I guess was a place where I could go to escape reality. but the dev stated that they were working on a new game and that in this new game the models would be way better and there would be animations too. So originally I was really excited about this i thought they were going to make this new game way advanced than Forest territory was and I was correct in that assumption when they released the game in early access they would eventually permanently shut down Forest territory and I was really sad about it but I ended up begging my parents for Robux so I could buy early access to the new game but eventually it released for free to everyone and it attracted more people because of the really good animations and models and I was also excited about this too more people would mean more ideas and people to roleplay with but it just was never the same as forest territory was now when I join this game nobody really does warrior cat roleplays anymore and before i could talk to people about the books almost everyone knew of them and had atleast read some of them but in this new game a lot of people don’t really. read the books. no one really talks to me there anymore either and I can’t really find anymore former forest territory players. that game was where i could go and talk about my love of warrior cats with other fans who loved and cared for both the books and the game it was where I would go when I was crying my eyes out and talking about warrior cats and roleplaying would make me feel better. This new game tho its just not really like that I used to play it a lot but eventually I just kinda stopped playing it because well it just didn’t do for me what forest territory did. To me forest territory wasn't just a Roblox game it was a whole community that taught me things when I was new and stuck by my side for as long as the game was open and now it’s gone if any former forest territory players see this it was an amazing experience while it lasted and I’m glad to have been apart of it. submitted by /u/Sorry-Warning1142 to r/WarriorCats [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Recently, as I'm sure 99% of you are aware, we received confirmation that LuaGuy has taken over the majority of ownership of Outcome Memories. While I personally don't know much about him, it seems that things, especially within the community, are beginning to look less bleak. I for one, am excited and hopeful, thanks to the non-stop encouragement and engagement Romeo has been giving our community. I think I speak for everyone when I say this, we are eternally grateful for the loyal members of the development team, be it Community Managers, coders, moderators, or what have you. We will continue to support this amazing project as long as you guys are committed to doing what you love. If anyone from the dev team or mod team is reading this, we're proud of you. We love and appreciate you. And you deserve this break. With all the recent drama, things seemed to be truly over. Chaos and doubt began to build within the community, but through Romeo, PR, and others, we were able to hold onto hope. As for now, as a whole, I think we the community need to take a step back from the devs and give them room to breathe, spread hope to those around us, and most importantly, continue showing the devs our support through posts akin to this, and playing the game. While I am sad that the game is on hiatus, and that the server is closed, it's time we come together in this moment to enjoy what we've already been given. Despite the jank and balancing and bugs, we still love this game, because we know what it can become. This is an ambitious project, and I believe in every single one of the developers, and all of us to show them that we want them to do their best, to flourish, and keep going, whenever they are ready. Thank you for reading. HOPE & PROSPER! submitted by /u/a_sweet_token to r/OutcomeMemories [link] [comments]",

      "content": "I've got a world going that I've been on for a few days now. I've got a moderately sized farm going, and I've been racking up essence of life over time by planting purely turnips as they're one of the best plants I can grow right now given the tier of my farmer's workbench. I was planning on then breaking down all those hundreds of turnips I've built up over the last few days into even more essence of life, so I could make some eternal seeds for other plants. I built up a bit over 2,200 EoL and it took a while, considering the length of one in-game day. I wanted to primarily grow wheat, and I didn't have enough wheat to make the amount of eternal seeds needed, so I decided to make some standard wheat seed bags to grow more. Issue is, I must've \"fat moused\" (if that's a term) and accidentally hit ALL, rather than making them in smaller, appropriate amounts. So, just like that, I lost every damn bit of my EoL that I built up, and I have a bunch of useless seed bags that I don't need. Is there a command I could use to give myself back 2,200 EoL or am I just kind of screwed here? I tried looking it up first but the command I'm seeing online isn't working for whatever reason.

It honestly feels like Riot is pushing people away from ranked and forcing them into normal games instead. The community has become insanely sensitive, the new champions feel pointless, and everything is a mess. They add things like Atakhan just to remove them, add new boots and then remove those too which just proves those updates were useless from the start.

They’ve stayed very cheap for very long but I wonder if there’s a chance that they would run out of stock and suddenly it’s crazy expensive and I would have to buy at EA app prices?

And never knew this was a thing. So it got me wondering. What are things you guys found that most people miss. Maybe something people miss if they do only a single play trough, or things so little you can only find out about it if you search for it.

Hardcore: No Respawn! If you splash: game over! If you stop: you're done! Can you even finish the race? 4. Realism Mode: The view is forced to the cockpit. Plus there's only manual gear shifts. 5. Reverse Track: Check the tracks from a different perspective. Track Editor Animations I've added some cool block animations, it's more satisfying to create tracks.

To increase difficulty, I'm thinking of setting level caps for Gym Leaders and the Elite Four. My questions are: What level caps would hi that sweet spot (challenging but not luck-based)? Any other rules or ideas to make it harder? How should I hande IVs, EVs and natures? submitted by /u/Green-Grapefruit4713 to r/pokemon [link] [comments]",

I went through the go.dev tutorial completely and two competing statements jumped out at me: Go does not support classes Functions can have explicit receivers To play around just a bit, I decided to try making a Tic Tac Toe game just to get some practice. My first gut instinct was to write a Board class: package board ... type Board struct { rows [][]string } func (b *Board) Initialize() { ... } func (b *Board) Place(row, col, marker) { ... } func (b *Board) PrintBoard() { ... } ``` Is this a distinction without a difference? Is there a more idiomatic way to simulate classes in Go? Also, and perhaps more controversially, where do y'all stand with single-letter variable names?

I have never gotten a degree, but I’m interested in studying recreation because I love to craft, play games, and I have always found helping people to be fulfilling. However, I am very introverted and I think pretty socially awkward at times. I’m pretty nervous if this is a right move for me, but I’m desperate to get out working construction or anything else labor intensive like I’ve been doing. I also chose this major because I believe I have undiagnosed ADHD, and my previous college experience has been pretty flighty. I have switched my major from art to horticulture and now to recreation. It’s also hard to decide to switch because I was making $35 an hour in the labor union, and I don’t want to go to school to earn something lower than that. Any advice and insight from people who’ve worked the field or are experiencing something similar would be lovely. Sorry if this post feels like a cry for help, because it sort of is to be honest. :’) I tried to keep it brief! Thank you :) submitted by /u/Maeriellis to r/recreationaltherapy [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Hey all, I have been developing a Voxel RPG game in Godot for a little while now. So far, I always tested my multiplayer locally, since hosting a server had some port forwarding issues. very early in the project I did do the networking stuff together with a friend, and we were able to connect and play together. without any issues. At this point, the only RPCs that were done were syncing the players position and rotation. Now that I also have enemies and movable objects, the host is responsible for all physics calls, and the client only listens to those changes. Now, I moved to Steam networking (GodotSteam is great!), but when playing with the same friend, his experience is horrible since my character, enemies and other movable objects all lag behind quite a bit. Now, this worked fine when I tested it locally. So probably it is a bandwith issue. His character runs smoothly in my instance of the game. Now, I am doing a lot of RPCs every frame (250-600). For all the physics stuff, I am wondering, does it make sense to only send this every few frames? And/or, would it make more sense to bundle some RPCs (so send over an array of enemy positions and rotations, with an RPC, instead of doing a seperate RPC for every single enemy)? Do you have any other tips in optimizing the multiplayer experience? submitted by /u/DaanBogaard [link] [comments]",

There's been lots of talk about mergers/acquisitions. But what does GME acquire? Do they move further from video games and dig their heels in to trading cards? Or some other collectible market? Gaming continues to move towards digital. Do they try to go big on digital gaming, attempt to rival Steam in the digital game field? Is there some other emergent market that GME could try to be the first big mover on to capture as much market share as possible? Their dip into NFTs was obviously a huge bust, but they were able to get out of that business mostly unscathed. Sitting on the cash doing nothing is the worst thing to do with it just from a purely financial perspective. That's not to say they should be careless, obviously caution is extremely important here. But I believe if they knew what they were doing with the money, they would have done it already. So I don't think they know what they're doing yet either.

I stay busy most days with school and a lot of sports outside of school, so I don’t have much free time. On most days, I only get around a couple of hours to really spend time with my partner. I wanted to ask about the game It Takes Two. I’ve heard it’s a really meaningful co-op experience, and it’s something I’d genuinely love to share with her. With how limited our time together can be, having something we can sit down and play together would mean a lot to me. She really loves games like Stardew Valley and plays them a lot, and I’d love the chance to have something we can experience together. It Takes Two includes a friend pass, which would allow us to play together, and that part really excites me. I think it would give us a way to feel more connected and make some good memories together. Thank you so much for reading this :) <3 submitted by /u/Own-Camp5181 to r/videogames [link] [comments]",

      "content": "About a month ago I shared a demo of my UE 5.7 SOG importer + Niagara Hybrid Gaussian Render pipeline. It takes unbundled SOG files and imports + converts them to UE usable textures, for sampling in shaders. It worked + looked great but since it was not a custom RHI, the performance did not scale well with large splat scenes. Last version was rendering 1M splat scenes at about 90FPS. This version runs 5M-10M splat scenes at 160-180 FPS . (havent tested larger scenes yet) The version now has: - Budget rendering for predicable frame rates ( a fixed size System is used for rendering so splat count is irrelevant ) - Deterministic slot assignment during Budget allocation ( necessary to combat atomic race issues in GPU stages) - Octree generation at import ( speeds up culling and LOD decisions) - HLOD (able to import up to 2 low res lod versions of the splat scene) - Per Splat LOD desicions ( decides whether or not to use full covariance calculation for unimportant, distant and small splats) Performance is still tied to Octree Node Count, so for larger splat scenes the leaf nodes just have more splats. Over draw can still be an issue when viewing dense regions up close. Biggest ball ache was actually dealing with the atomic race issues, which would lead to flickering during leaf node expansion after octree traversal. Theres a bunch of stuff thats also in there which I wont bore you with so yea... this is it. Stuff I still want/need to do : - smooth LOD transitions - reduce Texture size + lookups - LOD texture streaming - distance based budget allocation to deal with over draw in dense regions. submitted by /u/32bit_badman [link] [comments]",

At first I thought he seemed okay, but I've started noticing some red flags. He texts her constantly and gets upset if she doesn't respond immediately. Last week she missed a family dinner because he had some emergency that turned out to be nothing. She's also started pulling away from her longtime friends and seems anxious when her phone dies. When I try to talk to her about it, she gets defensive and says I don't understand their relationship. She insists he's just protective and really loves her. But yesterday I overheard him on the phone telling her that her friends don't really care about her and that he's the only one who gets her. I don't want to push her away or make her feel like she can't talk to me, but I'm worried this could e. She's always been pretty level-headed, but she seems like a completely different person lately. How do I handle this without making things worse? I feel like if I come down too hard, she'll just hide things from me more. submitted by /u/Hefty-Housing8933 to r/whatdoIdo [link] [comments]",

I’ve ran the sfc/scannow, I’ve ran the built in windows memory diagnostic, I’ve checked task manager. It all looks good, and no issues have been seen. I’ve also made sure everything is up to date like the GPU, Windows, and Chrome. I’ve also cleared all cache and browsing history. I’ve used the windows security and have done a full scan and I’ve isolated the things that have popped up. It’ll still say I’m out of memory with 2 high memory tabs open. I’ve restarted everything many times, as well as full shutdowns. Specific to chrome I’ve enabled memory saver, I’ve no extensions except for google offline, and I’ve disabled hardware acceleration. I truly don’t know what else to do to fix this issue. My memory also seems to run just fine when playing video games like Stardew Valley. I’m going to run a second windows security full scan and also try to run Marvel rivals to see if it has issues with that.

Description: This is a horror game that takes you back to the year 1922 the day a sad demonic incident happened. It tries to give a what if option, but never try to tell the story or disrupt it.. I made this game because I wanted to make sure my game gives meaning, aside from being funny all the time, I wanted to remind the world of things buried in silence, history fading. Also reminding us to be vigilant. I honestly don't even know if you guys would like it but I loved testing and making it, especially the graphics which I coded from scratch into Unity.

Typically, i post early in the morning with a projected lineup, refs list and scratches, then fill in goals/penalties as they happen with a shot/hits/blocks counter. so what i'd like to know is: are the threads as curated too long, are there items you would rather see over something else, are you just sick of me posting the threads instead of a bot?

So I have 2 Simblr accounts, one where I post ts4 stuff and the other for ts3. They both follow similar formats- me reblogging cc I like, getting inspiration from other simmers, and most importantly posting my own gameplay and stories. I’m super active on my ts4 blog, posting edits, dialogue, gameplay, etc. But I haven’t been active on my ts3 blog in months. Is that because I find ts3 boring and not as fun as ts4? …No, actually the opposite. When I play my ts4 saves, I spend a lot of time taking screenshots, posing my sims, and getting the right angle. But when I play ts3, I feel so immersed in the gameplay that I simply don’t want to take screenshots and edit them/pose sims. I can play for 10 generations and not get bored because it will feel different and new each time. But in ts4, the thing that keeps me coming back to do more generations is knowing I can post pretty screenshots for tumblr. My favorite way to play sims is to do family/generational gameplay, and it just feels so much more fun in ts3. Sims 4 is pretty, but Sims 3 is fun. I don’t feel the need to get the perfect screenshot in ts3, I just enjoy playing. I’m always discovering something new about the game, and guess what, I only just started getting all the DLC! I’ve had this much fun already just with the base game and Seasons, so I’m sure I’ll have even more fun with the expansions. Even though I only have 500 hours on ts3 and 5000 in ts4, I like ts3 so much better. It also has that classic sims quirkiness that I feel like isn’t quite there in ts4. I love when my ts3 sims randomly scream (“wibna chogga dog!” anyone?), heckle each other, and fight just because they feel like it. And the biggest help? The freaking open world. Every time I want one of my sims to go out and do something in ts4, I get turned off because I know everyone else at home won’t get anything done and will still be awake with needs in the red even if my sim returns at 3am. It sucks and makes me not want to go out unless the whole family comes. But in ts3, my teen can go out and party while dad is at home watching tv, mom is cooking dinner, and the child sibling is doing homework. I don’t have to worry about their needs going to shit because they have basic survival instincts and will take care of them if they need to. I do plan on posting more on my ts3 blog, but for now I’m just enjoying the gameplay. I wish I started ts3 way sooner, it’s fucking awesome! submitted by /u/Zenphiree to r/HighSodiumSims [link] [comments]",

I don't notice it in game that much unless I rapidly move the map while a turn is processing. After a day of troubleshooting, I've determined it's isolated to just this game and especially during the cutscene. I could live with it, except for I still have my 3070 in my son's PC now and when I try to replicate the screen tearing I cannot, even with absolutely no variable refresh rate technology enabled. Wondering if anyone else has experienced this and if there's a solution? I'm wondering if maybe it's just a thing with some older games and newer AMD GPUs/drivers. Or if I should return and get a 5070 or some other nvidia card Specs: 7600x3D 32 GB DDR5 @6000 MHz ASRock 9070 XT Challenger 1440 @ 165 Hz I've tried: AMD premium freesync on and off Different monitors Making sure freesync is enabled on the monitor Different refresh rates: 360, 240, 144, 120, 60 Custom refresh rate of: 163 and also 147 DisplayPort and HDMI cables (both new) VRR enabled/disabled in windows display settings Thanks in advance.

      "content": "I’m currently 23, about to turn 24 in April. Being 23 has been GREAT, probably one of the most fun ages I’ve ever experienced. I’ve just graduated from college, and everywhere I go people tell me how young I am to already be graduated, have a good job, and live on my own. I’ve never felt so successful while still feeling so young. On top of that, I love realizing that so many artists and singers I admire were my age when they were creating some of their best work. It feels like the perfect mix of youth and maturity. But now, 25 is slowly creeping in, and it’s making me extremely anxious about something that’s still more than a year away. What makes me most anxious is the feeling that I’m leaving the “young adult” age bracket (18–24) and that, from then on, I’ll be seen and treated the same way as someone who’s 30. Like… what do you mean yesterday I was 18, surviving the pandemic that stole my freshman year of college, upgrading my Fortnite battle pass and making TikTok edits, and now I’m in the same age bracket as TWENTY-FIVE-YEAR-OLDS? 💀 I’ve been very reflective these past few days, and I’ve come to the conclusion that I’m going through a third major transition in my adult life. I clearly remember when I was about to turn 18, ruminating over the fact that I was finishing high school and becoming legally an adult (in my country). Then I navigated the weird limbo of my late teens and was also scared to turn 20, which, surprisingly, was much less scary than turning 18. I simply accepted that my age now started with a 2, and it felt fresh and exciting. Jumping into my 20s and being the youngest in the “20s club” was fun as hell, even though COVID stole my 18 and 19. But now, turning 25 feels like a goddamn REQUIEM, like a final boss, the ultimate farewell to my youth. I’m already grieving something that isn’t even over. And that’s ironic, because I’ve always taken aging and acting my age very seriously. I just wanted to enjoy this status and this feeling for a few more years. Still, I know this is a transition. Turning 25 probably isn’t the end of the world. I can still hang out with people my age, play games, go clubbing, travel, and pay my bills at the end of the day… right? Does anyone else feel the same? Please tell me I’m not alone. 😭 submitted by /u/joaohunboi to r/OlderGenZ [link] [comments]",

It's the ability to see enemies through walls. If you've played any Farcry game before you would know what I'm talking about. Basically it would be a red outline or the color would match the enemy type like the illuminate being purple. This way you can plan attacks better and would be great for avoiding enemies when being stealthy. To balance the effects it would tag enemies in a radius that is half of your radar. This would also make the recon armor passive better. I really like the idea but it may be too good. submitted by /u/Unique_Ad1643 to r/Helldivers [link] [comments]",

I’m sorry but the dude legitimately talks as if it’s his first hockey game, every time. Horrible, horrible analysis.

Nothing makes me more irritated than every single mic shutting off EXCEPT for Buccigross. Why can’t his be the mic that shuts off? Noticeably worse video quality than other streaming services.

It means less people are excited/willing to pick tanks because its not fun. And that means more matches where your team does not pick tank. Tanks give you a frontline to play around with and they make space you to play. With no one playing tank, it just invites others much more non-interactive issues from other classes. Majority of my games no one hovers tanks in champion select, I don't want it to be all games. I'm not saying that some specific augments shouldn't get nerfed, but please consider that tanks can't just be alright nerfed. Also please do not say riot should just design tanks better, this is how tanks are in like every competitive multiplayer game.

      "content": "I’ve (41F) been on 2 dates with a guy (43M) who has never had kids and never been married. We’ve known each other for 2 1/2 years and were enough both attracted to each other, but neither of us initiated meeting up without others until recently. He only initiates texts to ask when I’m free for dinner/drinks and doesn’t make small talk in between so a whole week or two will go by before I hear from him unless i initiate and text him. We’re only able to meet up once every two weeks due to schedules. The first time this happened he was on vacation so I figured he just likes to be away from his phone while on vacation. But now it’s been a whole week since our second date and I still haven’t heard from him and I haven’t initiated either and want to pull back and see what he does. -1st date happens -Few days later he goes on a weeklong vacation. -He comes back and texts me two days after coming back asking for second date. -Another week goes by before we actually meet for second date. He doesn’t ever text first. I do. Responses are long and thought out. -Second date happens. -I text day after second date and he responds thoughtfully. -It’s been a 5 days and haven’t heard from him since. -He’s not gonna ghost me because I usually run into him every few months, but I have a feeling he’ll probably text in a few days. Has anyone been with somebody who was genuinely interested in them but only texts one time a week? I’m not used to such infrequent communication, especially in the beginning of getting to know each other. He doesn’t use social media so he probably isn’t on his phone all the time, but I have seen him use his phone to check the weather and the news and sports scores and he uses YouTube a lot. I’m anxiously attached so my nervous system is definitely triggered, but I don’t know if this is his communication style with everyone, or he’s just not all that interested submitted by /u/chocolattecheesy to r/relationship_advice [link] [comments]",

      "content": "For 1m+ there has been a game breaking bug in Franchise mode where every QB will regress every year, hard, no matter what. Including rookies. This makes it impossible to develop a QB effectively - the single most important thing for any team. After 3-4 years results in only 2-3 90+ QBs in league. It breaks immersion and ruins the experience. There have been a few yt'ers like C4 who covered this within last few weeks and I'm truly stunned there has not been a single statement or update from EA on this bug. They had a major title release on 17th with no mention in patch notes. The bug had been live for weeks. We all know how awful Franchise has been for 15+ years but this is by far the worst bug I have seen persist for the feature in Madden history. Its playoff time when I suspect many other Franchise heads are hyped to play the game, but it is truly unplayable in this state. Worse still, is the fact that EA has not even acknowledged this in any way. Its the bare minimum customer service - if you can't fix the issue at least let us know you are working on it. Please upvote/comment to help spread awareness so franchise fans can some response from EA. submitted by /u/Mark-A-G to r/Madden [link] [comments]",

My modest goal was to make a game that I enjoyed and that maybe 5 strangers would also like. It's a text-based life sim. Started as a bitlife clone that was going to be \"bitlife but deeper.\" But about 2 months ago, I stumbled on a different theme (set in a fictional authoritarian state where your choices could affect your unborn grandchildren), and I'm pretty excited about it. Started writing in Python, then had to switch it over to Unity (because I learned late that I couldn't easily use CustomTKinter UI for a web-based game on itch). Did it part-time around work hours (not working full-time right now, not sure I could have done this if I was). Leaned on LLM as a sort of 24/7 endlessly patient tutor and learned a lot as I went. I had some basic programming knowledge already and had made a few very small 'games' before. Also did Unity's Create with Code course back when I was furloughed in 2020. I'm very much a hobbyist, not pretending otherwise. I wanted to expand my skills and knowledge with this project, and make a game I wanted to play. I believe I succeeded in both those goals. Game will release as a free web-based game, hopefully in a few months.

I already have a mechanic where you can plant and grow crops, and the next step is making them harvestable. The problem is that I’m not sure what the best system would be. One idea is to use crates/boxes to collect the crops, and only allow selling them once the box is full. Another option is to add a small hotbar (like 2–3 slots) where the crops go when you harvest them. In both cases, I would add upgrades to these systems so the player can carry more items over time. However, I’m also planning to add automation systems later on, with machines/robots, conveyor belts, etc. So now I feel like I need to make a decision before continuing development 😅 Does anyone know which version works better in practice?

      "content": "Anyone who’s tried routing Warzone audio through a capture card on PlayStation has probably hit this wall. The moment you connect a second controller or user, game chat suddenly goes silent. Party chat might still work, system sounds are fine, but in game voice just disappears. This usually isn’t a Warzone bug by itself. It’s how PlayStation handles audio ownership. When a second controller signs in, the console often assigns voice chat to the primary active user or defaults it to the controller headset instead of HDMI or USB. Warzone is especially picky about this and doesn’t always switch back cleanly. What I’ve seen work most consistently is keeping the second controller signed in as a guest and muted, then manually setting audio output to HDMI in system settings before launching Warzone. Inside Warzone, double check voice chat device and make sure crossplay chat is enabled. If you’re using a capture card, disabling controller headsets entirely can also force chat back to HDMI. If it were my setup, I’d avoid the second controller workaround altogether and use a USB audio splitter or software routing on the PC side. It’s less fragile and survives updates better. Curious what setups you all are using. Capture card, party chat, Discord, something else? And did any weird fix work for you that shouldn’t have? submitted by /u/edward_dd to r/PlayStation_X [link] [comments]",

      "title": "Why People’s Friends Coming To ‘The 50’ Might Not Matter In The Long Run",
      "content": "Some people think it might be Person A vs Person B because a lot of their friends are coming, or because they’re well known - but that doesn’t necessarily matter in The 50. To sum it up, in the intl versions, even if ur friends came, they make u betray them 😭😭😭 Some of these big contestants friends may literally only be brought on to see if the big contestants have the ability to do ANYTHING to win the game. You might think someone’s support system makes them stronger, but in reality? It just gives the game more leverage. That alliance you’re banking on? That history? It’s fodder. Drama fuel. And you bet the game will make you choose between your goal and your relationships. The tasks don’t only have physical tasks, there’s a lot of mental/manipulative/mind game tasks. This isn’t Big Brother. This is a game built to break alliances. In the international versions of The 50, the presence of your best friend, your ride-or-die, your emotional support human… doesn’t protect you. In fact, the format weaponizes it. Players who tried to stay loyal often ended up being sacrificed by the game itself, twists, betrayals, forced eliminations. The rules shift just when you think you’ve figured them out. Example: In some versions, some “alliances” literally ended in people choosing to eliminate their own friends to secure their place. In The 50 (France), betrayal was practically the currency of strategy. Friends turned on friends. Not out of malice, but because the game made it the only path forward. The structure itself rewards the cold move, not the kind one. So while fandoms online are speculating that a player is safe or has a built-in army because they know 2-3 others on the cast… the show doesn’t work that way. Even mid-episode , the rules can change. The Fox (a literal costumed assistant of The Lion) might step in and say: “Congrats, you’re safe… but now choose someone to send home.” That someone could be your closest ally. The Lion Doesn’t Care About Your Friendships The host isn’t your friend either. In fact, in most versions, The Lion is a masked, anonymous, antagonist, and manipulative figure who controls the entire house with cryptic messages, rule shifts, and social torture disguised as “twists.” They don’t guide the contestants, they manipulate them. They’ve had seasons where: • Friends were put in direct combat to stay. • Assistants infiltrated groups to spread false info or gather info for the lion. • Eliminated contestants came back… knowing exactly who voted them out. Play For Yourself: That’s The Only Rule This is not the kind of show where popularity saves you. It doesn’t matter how many people shipped your friendship before the show. You could walk in with 3 best friends and leave by episode 2 if they decide you’re the weakest link, or the biggest threat. Strategy > Sympathy. Mind games > Loyalty. Self-preservation > Everything. So yeah, your faves might come in with backup. But The 50 is a test of how far you’ll go, how much you’ll sacrifice, and whether you’re ready to burn everything, including your allies, to survive. submitted by /u/kameueda to r/The50IN [link] [comments]",

      "title": "[Dating Advice] 3 playful texts that actually lead to a date (feat. Matthew Hussey’s secret sauce)",
      "content": "Everyone’s texting but no one’s dating. You match, you vibe, you talk... then it dies. Ghosted. Or worse, things drag on with zero real-world plans. If you’re feeling like your convos go nowhere, you’re not alone. A ton of people get stuck in the “talking stage” and never graduate to an actual date. Let’s fix that. This post is based on insights from Matthew Hussey’s Get The Guy , plus research from behavioral psychology and texting studies on attraction. What you're about to see actually works because it's playful, low-pressure, and makes people want to meet you. Unlike the boring “wyd” or forced flirty lines that flood TikTok. Let’s break down 3 playful, low-key texts that almost always lead to a date (when there’s mutual attraction). “Stop… you just gave me an idea.” This opener creates curiosity without being cliché or cringey. You follow it with something like, “We should do a coffee taste test and settle the iced vs. hot debate once and for all,” or “Mildly tempted to challenge you to a museum art-off… loser buys gelato.” According to Hussey, playful banter that subtly frames a date as a shared adventure makes it more appealing. It’s not about asking , it’s about imagining together. Harvard psychologist Dan Gilbert’s research on prediction and happiness (“Stumbling on Happiness”) shows we’re more likely to say yes to things that feel novel and lighthearted. “Ok so do you get into debates during brunch or are you normal?” This one’s gold. You’re teasing them playfully while implying a brunch date. It plays into what Hussey calls “assumptive flirting” you pretend the date is already happening. Studies by Dr. Arthur Aron (Stony Brook University) show that shared imagination and humor spike dopamine and connection even before people meet. Sneak that date idea in, don’t pitch it like a job interview. “Not to be dramatic, but I just found our new go-to spot.” You send this with a location (café, ramen place, bookstore bar whatever fits your vibe). Why it works: it’s bold and casual. You’re not begging for time, you’re offering a shared experience. Behavioral economist Dan Ariely talks about the “default bias”when you present something as a given, people are more willing to go along with it. You’re not saying, “Do you want to go?” You’re saying, “This should be ours.” These lines aren’t magic spells. They work best when you’ve already got a little spark . But most people mess up by texting safe, boring stuff. These texts invite curiosity, play, and shared imagination which are the real drivers of attraction, according to multiple studies in The Journal of Social and Personal Relationships . Text smarter, not harder. submitted by /u/nambi2002 to r/MensDiscipline [link] [comments]",

Blood Wings/claws signifying some form of corrupted life has reanimated him, skeletal/undead body, engraved runes marking his bones showing some forbidden or dark ritual, and green fel energy flowing through the runes and his eyes (inspired by world of warcraft).

There are no error messages or warnings to indicate what caused the crash. Both clients are experiencing the exact same issue.

      "content": "Ever notice how DLC problems almost always show up right when you’re ready to play? You buy it, it downloads, the store says installed, and the game acts like it doesn’t exist. I’ve seen this exact situation way too many times. Most people assume it’s a download glitch, but more often than not it’s a region mismatch. If the base game is a physical disc, its region has to match the region of the PlayStation account used to buy the DLC. If they don’t match, the console will happily take your money and install something the game will never recognize. Before panicking, I always check a few things. Press Options on the game tile and open Manage Content. If the DLC shows up there but says usable, it’s installed correctly. If it doesn’t show at all, that’s a red flag. Rebuilding the database or restoring licenses can help sometimes, but if the transaction is still pending, it may just be stuck in limbo. Personally, if I’m using a physical copy, I make sure the disc region and my PSN account line up before buying anything extra. Saves a lot of stress. If you’ve run into this, was it a region issue for you or did Sony support actually fix it? Curious how often this still catches people out. submitted by /u/edward_dd to r/PlayStation_X [link] [comments]",

I had one friend from high school that moved across the country and we still played games and discord called all the time but about 2 years ago we fought and he cut off contact. In terms of non coworker, platonic friendships I have 0. And I’m not necessarily upset about it most of the time because I don’t have to keep up with seeing anyone and can spend my days off for the most part the way I want to. But at the same time it sucks and I don’t have many people to go to and while I’m grateful to have at least some people to talk to I know I annoy them with my tv shows music and whatnot that they’re not into. I usually end up with most of my socializing being done with randoms on Reddit and Xbox public matches. All good if it’s just me I’ll take the L but was wondering if others are going through it too and what your suggestions are.

The playtest is open and unlimited 2. Very little marketing done (announced in the discord and posted a single instagram and youtube shorts reel) 3. Game is multiplayer (coop) and requires at least 2 players, or up to 10, so likely going to have an incredibly high drop off of people joining, launching and then quitting 4. I have friend invites enabled 5. Running for 2 weeks only, not sure if this is standard practice I'm not sure how much is botted, or if that's even a thing with playtests the way it is with demos. I've hardly marketed the game or playtest so am just surprised, friend invites being sent and accepted to me means it can't all be bots.

I've implemented a day/night cycle with a dynamic lighting system that changes the atmosphere throughout the day. There's now a working loot system with chest interactions, and I've populated the environment with new sprites like trees, bushes, and decorative elements. I'm having a blast working on this project every small addition makes the world feel more alive and keeps me motivated to push forward. The lighting combined with the time cycle especially creates amazing atmosphere. Still learning Godot as I go, but the engine has been incredibly approachable.

She's a huge basketball fan, used to play it when she was younger before switching to volleyball. So she's pretty sporty. There's this player in the NBA that she used to go to middle school with and partially high school as well. She follows his career closely and a huge fan. She watches most of his games. Watches all his highlights on youtube. And she talks about him constantly. Always bringing up how he's always been \"him\" since childhood. She also follows him on social media. I see her liking his posts and leaving heart emojis. It feels like she is crushing on him and it's pissing me off. It's bad enough her fangirl shit already seems a bit over the top, but it's just the fact she actually knew him as well. And lord knows if they still keep in contact or not. Which she denies. Makes me paranoid. Obviously I've confronted her about it, told her it feels like she's crushing on dude and I don't like it. But she's accussing me of being insecure for nothing. She's allowed to support one of their \"hometown heroes\". And that I wouldn't get it, I'm not from her hometown and don't understand how loyalty runs deep with their people. I mean, yeah... i get it. I'm not from some crazy sports town on the eastcoast, regardless I think her behavior is inappropriate. We've gotten into a few arguments now over this.

I wonder what horrir elements I can add in this very barebones GUI? There are some tasks where the player needs to look into the log file to retrace their steps, and seeing log rows of another, unexpected user doing things on the computer is one thing I will explore.

When the material is created, the standart option BACK is selected, but some body parts act like the FRONT option is selected instead. And it goes further: when i select the FRONT option, the bugged body part shows like the BACK options is selected. like it is inverted.

I encountered a couple other mods which do something similar, but I found them to be either a bit too much or not quite enough for my taste. So I made one that hopefully makes the Glowing Sea feel like more of a risk at virtually any level, without completely overwhelming the experience. Though, you can be overwhelmed. Think swarms and proliferation. More radroaches, bloodbugs, stingwings, bloatflies, and ghouls. I imagined they'd thrive in larger numbers rivaled only by other species. Some creatures level with you. Other stronger variants don't. Most use leveled lists so that spawns aren't exactly alike each time. There are a few unique variants of ghouls and behemoths as well and some I'll leave you to discover. Give it a shot and let me know what you think. Danger isn't everywhere you go, but you can be ambushed at any point, so bring plenty of stimpaks, radaway, and heavy artillery.

      "content": "Our team at Deep Matrix is thrilled to release Dixotomia in full access on Steam and Meta. The development took us more than 4 years. The last 2 years were especially busy, as our team grew to up to 12 people at some point in development. This VR shooter, where you fight vampires with sci-fi tech and dark powers, has been a labor of passion. When we launched our game into Early Access at the end of August, we were full of hope. But the reception was a wake-up call. Many players rightly pointed out that the game wasn’t where it needed to be in terms of polish, balance, or content. It was disappointing to realize we’d missed the mark. But instead of backing down, we got to work. We’ve spent the past 5 months addressing every issue, implementing major overhauls, and reworking core systems based on player feedback. We’re proud to say the game has improved dramatically, and we’ve finally made the game we believe is truly worthy of a full release. Dive into the story on the planet Karna and choose your path. https://store.steampowered.com/app/1367710/Dixotomia/ submitted by /u/DeepMatrixVR [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Hello everyone, I’d like to share a project I’ve been developing completely on my own. The game is called Bloody Fate. Bloody Fate is a single-player, story-driven action shooter set in Sicily. It is not an open-world game — the focus is on narrative, atmosphere, and character-driven progression. The story follows Leo, a man who arrives in Sicily after the death of his father. Hoping to leave his past behind, he opens a small grocery store and tries to start a quiet new life. However, the region’s criminal networks soon pull him into a world he never wanted to be part of. Every decision he makes to survive pushes him deeper into an irreversible path within the mafia underworld. The game features: First-person and third-person perspectives Narrative-driven missions and dialogue Cinematic, mission-based combat A dark, serious mafia and revenge theme I’m developing this project entirely solo, handling programming, design, and story myself. My goal isn’t scale, but to deliver a focused, memorable story with a strong atmosphere. Feedback, thoughts, and criticism are more than welcome. Thanks for taking the time to check it out. Wishlist on Steam If Bloody Fate caught your interest, you can support the project by adding it to your Steam Wishlist. Every wishlist really helps a solo developer and makes a huge difference submitted by /u/Particular_Mine_4189 [link] [comments]",

And even without playing for years at a time, I have a level 16 Golem somehow. Anyways, I love playing Golem first play. If I don't see Golem in my starting hand, I am disappointed. I love putting it down, having a single bat from Night Witch stop the hog or whatever the counter push is in the opposite lane, and just creating a steam roll. Yes, I am mid ladder at 10,250 trophies. No, I don't care to try and actually win. The pure joy that fills me when I win with Golem first play is greater than actually be going good at the game. Knowing how mad some people get, it makes me smile. And, you would be shocked at how well this works. Sometimes you lose instantly, especially if the person is smart.

In this video, I am showing what could happen to stunned enemies in my game and how they can be displaced. I have set a high number for the stun value just to showcase this mechanic, which doesn't really give a chance to the enemies to respond (they have fully implemented behaviours and can attack, idle or patrol and transition smoothly between all these states and also both enemies have different attacks) but this will be an example for another time. Curious to see what you think about this and if you like it or not, this is very early in development so anything is subject to change.

      "content": "To preface what I mean before asking the question, I've played many games where increases in difficulty were things like \"draw one less card this turn\" or \"your abilities have an extra one second cooldown\" and while they seem innocuous from the outset, they can quite easily end up breaking player builds and strategies. I don't disagree the players will find ways around this, but sometimes players can get attached to a style of play and you can rip it away from them in the difficulties, reducing their enjoyment and the quantity of useful/fun strategies. It's one of my biggest bugbears in gaming, and I've spent quite a lot of time working on my own game's difficulty. Trying to make sure cards and styles aren't removed (as much as possible) by difficulty tiers. For example, I don't have any difficulty settings that increase enemy stats, it would change the breakpoints at which the player's cards are useful. I just wanted to ask anybody else if they've found the same, and what methods they're using to prevent it from becoming an issue in their game? submitted by /u/Silvenx [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Seriously, I think some code is bugged within the game. I've been macroing on rose field for 50+ hours with 7 diamond bees with no luck. When taking ability time, rest time etc into consideration, a diamond bee gathers at MOST once per 10 seconds. That is 6*60*50 = 18 000 gathers per diamond bee in 50 hours and well over 100 000 gathers for all 7. Asuming extremely rare is a 1/10 000 chance, the chance of me NOT getting the sticker within 100 000 gathers is: (9 999/10 000)^100 000 ≈ 0.005% or about 1 in 20 000.

      "content": "so basically i have a huuge problem, im about to graduate in game audio and i decided to do a remake of the doom soundtrack and from Wwise putting it on this doom project for Unity that i found on github, the problem is that i cant make the RTCP of the health of the player play, basically in the first picture you’ll see the player control script with the health in the player stats at 100, in the next pic theres the RTCP that should put a filter on the music when the health goes down, it only works manually, i can put the game in playmode, connect it to wwise and i can drag the player health value (RTCP) manually and it works, but when the player takes damages the health on wwise and on unity stays at 100, also when i drag it stays at 100 but it still works in game for some unknown reasons. in the second pic you can also see the player on the RTCP (blue dot on the right) i cant drag or do anything with that probably is that the problem? i need some serious help cause my uni informed me earlier yesterday that is due tomorrow at midnight (im in europe so its 3am now so its acutally due today) so yeah every help is appreciated, thanks:) submitted by /u/Skerhex [link] [comments]",

      "content": "There are WAY too many new skins and not enough time to grind for all of them unless you no-life the game. I've played for at least an hour per day for the duration of this event and I still have all of the killer skins and five survivor skins to unlock, and I really don't think I'm going to be able to complete it because I simply can't afford to be on the game constantly. It really wouldn't have been that big of a deal if it was easier to grind gingerbread, but they both reduced the amount of gingerbread you get by removing the survivor win bonus and more than doubling the amount of skins you needed to buy (41 compared to the masquerade's 20.). Ignoring Nosferatu's cost since he was added to the shop after the event: Masquerade: 20 skins = 3,660 sukkars \"Coolest\" Christmas: 41 skins (21 event, 20 shop) = 5,910 gingerbread If I recall, didn't one of the higher ups mention how they're not big on the concept of fomo? If I am remembering correctly, it's pretty rich to say that and then turn around and pull this bs. And the real kick in the nuts is that it's such an easy fix, there's many different ways they could have done it: Add back the survivor win bonus Convert literally any of the masquerade's sukkars to at least some of the new gingerbread currency. Make the shop skins cost less gingerbread, or just make them cost player points instead (that's how it was last year, why does it have to be different now?). As it stands, I'm majorly disappointed with the event, it was already lazy enough to reuse the masquerade but the insane grind created by this one has made me burnt out of this event format, and I sincerely hope they do something different for any future events. submitted by /u/Altforislandstrading to r/FORSAKENROBLOX [link] [comments]",

The original GBVS was released 6 years ago which would normally be near EOS for most fighting games, and GBVSR was released more than 2 years ago. I'm intend to start playing regardless, but I'm wondering how long it will continue to be supported with new content. Apparently it's already kind of hard to find players at C/D rank so that has me worried a bit. I'm assuming GBVSR probably won't go 6-7 years since if we count the original game it would be 12-13 years at that point, so maybe GBVSR has another year or two left? Will they even make a new Granblue fighting game in the future? Since it's technically not a fighting game IP submitted by /u/somersaultandsugar to r/GranblueFantasyVersus [link] [comments]",

      "content": "When I got my NES 20 years ago when I was in high school, one of the games I specifically picked out was Wrecking Crew. I didn't really think it was amazing, just kind of playable and interesting But when I was watching triplejumps every mario game ranked, they ranked wrecking crew relatively low and even made a joke about how it would be a terrible way to spend your last week alive or something. Is it really awful though? I could see the point that it isn't particularly good, it's just not bad either. It at least deserves points for originality, especially coming off the precrash consoles where everything was a spaceship shooter or paddle game It's kind of an interesting proof that Nintendo always tried to innovate and come up with something original, but it's also kind of a proof that original doesn't always mean good. But not bad either. Of course it would have been better if the US (and Europe if it was even released there at all) got the tape drive or some other way to save levels, but I really don't think that would have saved (no pun intended) it. Excitebike and Penguin Land (on the Sega Master System) let you create levels and no one cares. I don't think no one cares just becuase you can't save, I think it is the fact that you don't have the ability to make anything really fleshed out like when making a ZZT map or Doom wad, or even a Super Mario Maker level submitted by /u/bigdonut100 to r/nes [link] [comments]",

You probably don’t think it’s a big deal when you send me a screenshot of the thing you just bought or compliment my fitness progress nth times but to me those are anchors. You’re giving me emotional landmarks in a day that would otherwise blur together. You don’t love bomb. You don’t future-fake. You don’t manipulate me with big words. Instead, you show up. Quietly. Steadily. In your own time. And God—you didn't know how much I missed that version of you until you came back. The version of you I first met. The one who made me laugh, kept me curious, made me feel safe without ever saying the words out loud. I used to think connection had to be loud to be real. I used to fall for men who were fluent in poetry but bankrupt in presence. You’re different. You don’t play the game and yet somehow you still win my day. Even when you’re far away. Even when it’s just laundry updates, work rants and gym wins. Even when you disappear for a bit and I doubt everything — you still come back with that quiet spark in your messages like, “What? You missed me?” Yeah. I did. So just in case no one’s told you lately: You’re appreciated.

      "content": "My partner is a mid-level web developer in NYS (specializes in angular) and until 2023 had no problem finding a job. He took a “sabbatical” at this time (his contract ended/there was a devastating family loss), started a business (he’s making a video game, which is not ready for release yet), and now is starting to apply to jobs. It’s been two years since he worked for someone else on the books. He doesn’t love web development/coding and is possibly considering a career change (possibly law/something with more job security). Any guidance on how he should move forward? submitted by /u/Zealousideal-Oil6193 to r/careeradvice [link] [comments]",

It is a grid based puzzle game that features hand drawn art and cute flower animal hybrids. I thought it might be good for any channels that do indie game content or focus on cozy games. I need help with play testing especially for broken combos where people can optimize getting into the millions of points too easily with builds and combos I didn't notice. Also don't feel obligated to make content out of it, I'd love to just see people play and people who already have a YouTube setup I figure would be a good option for that. If you are interested feel free to comment or DM me and I can send you the demo or full version on itch (completely playable in browser for now before it goes up on steam). submitted by /u/chocochiyoko to r/youtubegaming [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Hi there, so, I am going to terribly describe what I think I have a phobia of, or at least something that actually makes me panic quite a bit. I don't know if there's some phobia that overlaps with Thalassophobia: ( the persistent and intense fear of deep bodies of water, such as the ocean, seas, or lakes ) and Nyctophobia ( Fear of the Dark/Unseen ) but I'll describe situations where it does and doesn't trigger. Doesn't Trigger: A dark room? I mean when I'm going to bed, that's fine, lights off, crawl into bed, not a hint of concern. Pools? Most at least, once the water gets to a point of distance where I can't actually see the other side underwater, then that's an issue but that's like..in murky as heck water. Does trigger: (Sorry but I've only had it actually trigger in situations in games.) Underwater levels where I cannot see the whole space. If like..the render distance is closer to me and I cannot see from one side of the area to the other, I will start to freak out a bit. A pitch black location where everything had suddenly disappeared. You ever play a horror game where you walk into a pitch black room, you turn around and then the door's gone, and then there's just nothing? So, it's not a fear of water specifically, I love swimming, and not a fear of normal darkness, but some extreme of both where I cannot see my entire space. Like, a phobia of lacking awareness of my surroundings? submitted by /u/Strange_Ad_2032 to r/Phobia [link] [comments]",

      "content": "I've been looking into getting the mini flip for an EDC device and was wondering if I could realistically play a game like Metroid: Zero Mission on it somewhat comfortably. The \"comfortability\" of a device isn't really just the overall size; The weight and buttons (especially the triggers in a game like Zero Mission) play a big part in it too. If we're getting nitpicky I've found the buttons on my brick are noticeably harder to press down than on other devices I've used, so I ended up finishing Zero Mission on my DSi instead. The extra pressure I needed to use on the brick made my hands cramp up sometimes playing it, with the only saving grace being that it would have been even worse if it wasn't as hefty as it is. I also own the regular miyoo mini v4, and while the face buttons are easy to press, the triggers were a nightmare when trying Zero Mission, and I also felt like I had to \"baby\" the device to not damage the screen. The clamshell design of the mini flip would solve this problem, with the bonus of having triggers that are actually flat rather than slanted. Even though I have medium-sized hands, I never really found small devices like these as uncomfortable as most people seem to say. Maybe it's just how I like to hold them compared to others but it's something to note. So all of that nitpicking is just to say that if the miyoo mini flip is lightweight AND has easy-to-press buttons then that might make it pass the Zero Mission test in my book. I wanted some other opinions on if I'm just delusional or not! submitted by /u/zase7 to r/SBCGaming [link] [comments]",

Full list: Practical Gifts That Make the First Months Easier This list skips the fluff and focuses on practical wins that matter: handling diaper changes anywhere without drama, establishing better sleep routines, and small comfort upgrades that actually get used every single day instead of collecting dust. One standout from the roundup: a formula dispenser that makes a warm, perfectly measured bottle in literal seconds, no scooping, no measuring, no mixing at 3am while half asleep. It's the kind of gift that pays off immediately when you're running on zero sleep and just need something to work right the first time. The guide also covers other essentials like portable diaper stations, quality baby carriers that don't wreck your back, white noise machines that actually help babies sleep, and dad-specific gear that makes the learning curve less steep. What was your most-used piece of gear as a new parent, the thing you genuinely couldn't have survived without? submitted by /u/Important-Road-3493 to r/readingspace [link] [comments]",

      "content": "I’m a solo dev working on a small card-based lane RTS about cats called Claws of Power . You spend dried fish as a resource to summon different cats onto the lane and try to crack the enemy base. Each unit has its own role/skill, so it’s more about timing and cost management than pure spam. The two vampire gifs are from a later boss fight where the boss moves with the wave, throws out big attacks and can easily wipe your frontline if you mistime your summons. The last gif is a little interaction I like: a tiny knight cat jumps onto a big tank cat and rides along while attacking, so they move as one unit. I’m still tuning the balance, but if this kind of thing interests you, there’s a free demo on Steam here: https://store.steampowered.com/app/3998900/_/ submitted by /u/Zestyclose_Party8281 [link] [comments]",

In 2014 moved and restated everything on UE4, was very excited about the engine going public. Since then, the game was on every release of the Engine, since 4.0, the demo released on 4.17 and the final game released on 4.20 on Steam in 2018 (it was a Greenlight game at the early days of the program and was greenlit in ~6 days), then on 4.22 on Xbox and Switch in 2020. Been ID@ Xbox and Nindies developer since day one of these programs, but Sony always rejected being a developer due to some paperwork. Anyways, then for new generation of the same platforms in 2025 on 5.6 and in few days on PS4 & PS5 still on 5.6. The game been localized to 16 languages, had some special engine features that are never part of Unreal, and been worked alone during all those years! It has been a wild journey! submitted by /u/VikongGames [link] [comments]",

Luke's boat was supposed to be packed with all sorts of monsters. And Argus, was not mention or seen. The hippocampi were only shown super far away, just their top halves, and no one even rode them. Heck, the Mist is barely a thing, and the Golden Fleece didn't even turn into a Letterman jacket like in the book. The only thing I can say the movies did right was actually making the fantasy elements feel real.

Is it up to us to reach out to our local USA Hockey affiliate or will the ref make a report to them?

There's also a ton of smaller companies at the show, that would probably jump at the chance to feature their products in a Ghost Recon game. Things like a pistol mounted red dot sight, with integrated thermal, a new PDW from Geissele, and a new quad NVG, that can also display a video feed, from a drone. submitted by /u/Megalodon26 to r/GhostRecon [link] [comments]",

I was truly surprised at how packed the game was looked basically sold out. After the game the media was interviewing fans outside and it was crazy how so many braved the weather just to see Luka! It still dumbfounds me how ignorant Nico Harrison was for trading Luka. Not wanting to give a max contract to a player that easily deserved it. I can only imagine the amount of money lost from Luka merchandise and especially ticket sales making a max contract seem trivial in regard. Watching who you thought was going to be your franchise player on another team and seeing your team go from finals contenders to not even playoff ready.

I think Unreal Engine has this default distance fade thing (idk it's a long time since I used Unreal), and it looks pretty cool. If anyone is knowledgeable on where I could find how Unreal handles that please let me know!

From Dark Souls, the combat foundation - but with my own twists and ideas. I’m developing all of this completely solo in Unreal Engine 5. Over 3000 hours of work, no team, and almost no budget. A year and a half ago, I was just an IT employee, but I made a sharp career change, started learning programming from scratch, and fully dove into game development.

I don't understand why this has to be so hard, Mithril. I get you don't want any \"F.U.D./unrest\" spreading, but the silience is much more damaging; people are go through the 5 stages of grief; having hopium, frustration, anger, utnil they finally just accept it and leave forever. as things die down and get worse for pc players, i’d strongly advise becoming more transparent. whether the news is good or bad, people need to be kept informed so they know what to expect. hiding behind the whole fud philosophy just makes things worse and will make people hate you.

As a longtime Street Fighter player it's really ANNOYING for me to adapt myself to this grab command. It's not intuitive at all. I play with a Ps4 pad and here is the layout I use which is the most logical one to me: | L | M | - R1 => | S1 | | T | H | - R2 => | S2 | Why using M+H to grab? I mean SF6 is the most played fighting game at the moment and LP+MK to grab. Even others famous fighting games are using LP+MK to grab: Granblue Fantasy Versus: Rising, Melty Blood, Under Night In-Birth, Skullgirls etc... So why not using the same grab shortcut for 2XKO? I really want to continue to play this game but man... It is really hard for me to play this game sometimes. No motion inputs: I'am OK with this now. Tag team: I'm used to it too.

      "content": "Make run history like 100 runs, or 200 runs. Why not? It would be so much cooler to see long term progression. I’m doing the Nuke and Death Defy missions right now and unless I go in and delete every run after, 20 runs just got wiped like that. MORE RUN HISTORY (put a number the runs so it’s easier to keep track of when scrolling too) Allow me to shatter more modules at once!?!??! Why can I only shatter 12 mods at once?!?!? Show mods, range and shockwave size used in round stats since they can’t be changed anyways so there’s nothing complicated to keep track of. Allow me to change the coins per minute to a rolling average of the last 5 minutes or last 10 etc. Or add a graph to battle history/stats showing CPH over time. Make spotlight more visible. It’s hard to see with all the other stuff on screen! More card presets. I know some of you will hate me for giving Fudds ideas but to me this is like the perfect thing he could charge 5 bucks for. If you’re cheap you don’t need it and if you’re like me then fine, if it costs 5$ to have like 5 more card presets then just do it. Module presets like we have card presets so I don’t have to click 10 times to adjust for tournaments. Lab presets for range and shockwave for the same reason. Have banners where one module is like 500 gems but you can get max 1 or 2 from the banner. Stops people from getting too many but evens the playing field somewhat.

To kick off my return, I stopped procrastinating and finally moved my game to GitHub so I could have proper version control and backups. I also have reworked the tile system for the game. Originally, maps consisted of a start and end tile, with 3 rows of 5 tiles in between. All of the connections between tiles were also hard-coded. Now, paths can be randomized without any hard-coding (with the exception of the start/end tiles since both of those should always connect to the start/end of the paths between them). I also added in an arrow to visualize which way a tile leads so players can plan their routing more strategically. submitted by /u/TheOGRG [link] [comments]",

      "content": "I was thinking playing today on Lethal with my friends. I wish this game would just promote more coop mechanics. Like I wish we could stagger enemies off when they are attacking our friends, instead enemies get stagger immunity after few hits. And if your friend is in trouble, you can't really do much to get them off, except try to do supreme damage. Also it would be cool if you could see all the red attack warnings that your friends are seeing. Because that is how the game is played, you see red attack you dodge. But when you try to help your friend, you don't see them. And you might get hit. (Yes I am sure most people who read this are masters who can tell what is red attack in their sleep 😄). Also if someone manages to parry the attack, attack shouldn't hit some other character to the face after that. There are a lot of reasons why trying to help your teammates is kinda super risky. So I usually just shoot enemies with my pistol instead. But it would be cooler if we could really rush some enemies together better. And how about sticking close to your team makes temporary health go down BIT slower? That would imo be great too. Also the stims, they seem to always be a problem, who takes them, why some refuse to take them and why doesn't someone know of Mortal Wounds? It's easy to fix (but probably not easy to program haha), just let us stim teammates. And sometimes we could show them: \"Hey, this is how you can fix Mortal Wound.\" This game could have more stuff like this, right now it kind of encourages to not stick together so much and instead you should stick to your own portion of the level. submitted by /u/SuperArppis to r/Spacemarine [link] [comments]",

It can also be composed, sequenced, or otherwise produced to be indirectly played mechanically or electronically, such as via a music box, barrel organ, or digital audio workstation software on a computer. Music often plays a key role in social events and religious ceremonies. The techniques of making music are often transmitted as part of a cultural tradition. Music is played in public and private contexts, highlighted at events such as festivals and concerts for various different types of ensembles. Music is used in the production of other media, such as in soundtracks to films, TV shows, operas, and video games. submitted by /u/Flaviphone to r/balkans_irl [link] [comments]",

If it goes all the way down, you can slow down and it will be harder to focus on catching ghosts! If you like, I would appreciate if you can check it out and share any feedback as it helps a ton!

In terms of the video games I play, I primarily like Nintendo things; (if you like Mario, Pokémon, Super Smash Bros., Rhythm Heaven, etc. we'll likely get a long well!). Some non-Nintendo franchises I like include Pac-Man, Mega Man, and Minecraft! I'm also getting into Sonic quite a bit! I also REALLY love playing retro games from the NES era all the way up to DS/Wii era -- and gosh it's crazy that those are considered retro now o_o Aside from just playing games, I also am a content creator and make YouTube gaming videos at times! I also program/code, primarily software and web development stuff, with a bit of game projects on the side as a hobby. I also am into art.. but only a bit! :P I like doing pixel art and drawing from time to time (I'm not really that good LOL), but if you're an artist I'd love to see your work! I love seeing peoples creativity, their OCs, -- even if you're a furry, I love seeing everybodys characters & all that! I also am an amateur voice actor (I just do impressions and such for fangames, nothing major yet!) Lastly, I watch a lot of YouTube videos and also like cartoons a lot!

      "content": "I was at the game today and something really stuck with me in a bad way. Midway through the second period they showed some fans on the video board who had anti-ICE signs. A big chunk of the crowd started chanting “No more ICE.” Instead of letting that moment exist, GSA immediately made a Code of Conduct announcement over the PA to shut it down. On top of that, last week at a few games I saw security taking anti-ICE signs at the gates and I personally know people who were turned away for wearing anti-ICE shirts. That feels really gross given how much this organization talks about inclusivity, diversity, and standing with the community. This is not some abstract political issue. People in Minnesota are angry and scared because of what ICE has been doing here and because people have literally been killed. Fans reacting to that in a public space is not random or disruptive, it is a reflection of what the community is dealing with right now. I get that teams want to avoid “politics” at games, but choosing to silence one side is not neutral. It is a choice, and it sends a message about which voices are acceptable and which are not. I love this team and I want to be proud of the organization too, but today felt like a big miss. Curious if anyone else at the game noticed this or had the same reaction. submitted by /u/AdrianDitmann to r/TwinCities [link] [comments]",

In the game I'm running 4k, high settings with fxaa set to the lowest it can go. The game is so choppy and laggy. Dosent seem to matter what I do. I've set the game to 1080p, no v sync, 1080p with v sync, everything as low as possible. Ive done game file checks. Even turned down my monitors refresh rate to 60hz. Seems things I've read online is the games code for msaa is bugged. And disabling it helps but you can only do that with a nexus mod that's been deleted. My fps isn't bad it's just laggy and I get so much light flickering. I've even reinstalled my driver's. What's weird is i never had this issue when I had a 1660 or a 3060 My monitor is a 4k 240hz monitor. Ive moved it over to the 1440p one thats at 165hz. Seems no matter what i do the game is just a choppy mess on my rig. Idk if switching over to a dual copy of Linux with Proton would help Idk if anyone here has any ideas. It's just not a smooth experience and I'd rather not bust out my xbox to play this at my desk I also want to mention that I'm not getting any thermal throttling.

But in the perspective of someone that just recently bought it there is no way I’m paying for all the job packs just to actually have like a decent amount of fun on the game. And now they’re adding a bunch of new stuff like the Hollywood thing the same thing the vampire stuff it’s so annoying for how money hunger they are.

You even have to pay extra money to play other casino games other than blackjack like I feel like that should just be something that could be in the base and if you don’t buy bitizenship s you get bombarded with ads like every five seconds the idea of the game is absolutely fun but the execution of it and the obvious greed from the owners just completely destroys the game itself.

People have been my best friends but I’ve never been theirs. All through elementary school and middle school and high school I tried to make friends. I was a little weird but i remember making conscious decisions to not make weird choices or say anything the normal kids wouldn’t like. And although I wasn’t bullied, people didn’t want to hang out with ne either. Around high school it got better but I realized I was part of a « group » but always the last to be thought of, and never made a priority. A few things i remember in particular- it was not birthday and my parents allowed me to invite some friends to the movies. Nobody came, they all had excuses and my parents had my older sister and her friend take me instead. I was so embarrassed. Another time i was meeting some people at a football game and I didn’t know where they were sitting. I asked a girl for the group if she could never ne at the entrance and walk with me to the group and she didn’t want to. Nobody in the group did. I remember when I found then and they made plans without me I was left wondering if this would be my entire life. my older sister always had so many friends and I wanted to be like her so badly. She’s still friends with a lot of people from college and High school today. I want that so badly. I want a group chat. I want girls nights. I want someone I can cry to and whine to that isn’t my husband. I joined a sorority (yes you can do that as an adult lol) and I’m hoping to make some friends and genuine connections. I’m trying my best to out myself out there and make the effort but Idk, I guess part of me is asking what the masses think. How can I make REAL friendships at my age? Bumble was a bust for sure.

      "content": "A while ago, I posted about my work on a new flow field algorithm for navigation. I'm here with a progress update, and a bit of a practical demonstration as well. Alright, so, here's the gist of it: the algorithm works for the most part . I haven't been able to fix every single edge case that pops up, but the good news is that errors no longer seem to propagate more errors as the algorithm spreads out. Therefore, I see the algorithm as in a usable state. I believe there are improvements that could be made, but—for now—I'll work towards documenting and polishing my current solution so that you all can use it for your own games. In the mean time, here's a bit of a practical demonstration of the difference between a regular flow field and my \"fungi\" flow field (the name was inspired by experiments with slime mold exploring mazes). I'm working on a game where you play as a speedboat running from torpedoes, which you can see in the second part of the video. The green lines coming from the \"torpedoes\" indicate the direction that the navigation field is pointing the torpedoes towards (the pink lines are from the avoidance field, so you can ignore them). With the standard flow field, you can see that the targets are only in 8 directions ( up, down, left, right, and diagonals ). This works, but it creates rigid movements and sub-optimal paths. With the fungi flow field, you can see how it's pointing them in all directions. This creates smoother movements and better paths for the torpedoes, all within the same time complexity as a standard flow field. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. submitted by /u/Nondescript_Potato [link] [comments]",

I couldn’t beat the duo bosses in the top-left area, even after exploring everywhere I thought I could. Eventually, I gave up and watched an online playthrough. I completely missed Cubicle, Manufacture, and Canopy. I knew I miss a “super jump” ability. I thought it was after the duo bosses. For Cubicle, I spun the wheel and tried the lift a few times, but nothing clicked. Canopy was on me — I should’ve explored the entrance area more thoroughly. Manufacture was worse: I never found the last code and had no idea where to get it. Here’s the thing: after watching the playthrough, I realised I probably never would’ve beaten the duo bosses anyway. I was missing too many MODs, I’m terrible at aerial combat, and there’s no way I could’ve cleared the platforming in Cubicle. The horror I’ve seen. Honestly, it’s a huge relief knowing I don’t have to suffer through that. Great game. 10/10. submitted by /u/MimiGoldDigger to r/metroidvania [link] [comments]",

However, with most things getting a hike up it seems like Spotify is more expensive than having a YT Premium account that has more benefits than it.

The game runs at 60fps with barely any dips (confirmed both by mangohud and steam overlay), but it genuinely feels almost unplayable due to micro stutters on ANY graphics settings. I tried both Steam and Lutris with different proton versions (including GE), I tried switching the force power option to high, and I am using gamemoderun. The only thing that actually helps is lsfg-vk (lossless scaling), which makes my game run capped at 100fps (monitor is 100hz), but introduces latency, which is why I would rather fix it and play it at 60fps native. Pls help! Thanks! submitted by /u/lawdfaquad to r/linux_gaming [link] [comments]",

      "content": "If I was even pettier I would track and make a chart showing how long each character from all 4 seasons stays silent on average and bet your ass Aabria would come in last. Every single thing other players do, she comments on. She doesn’t just meta comments, she makes her character scream a comment at the other end of the room for a scene that she is not part of. Every beautiful description by Brennan ends with her one liners. She constantly makes small talk with Occtis that does not carry the story forward. Every single dice roll whether high or low warrants an audible reaction by her. EVERY SINGLE ROLL. You don’t have to say ‘Allright!’ ‘Thats good! Thats good right?’ to every 19 rolled…….. I am extremely disappointed on how the Seekers table turned out especially after the treat that was the Soldiers. I think I will skip the Seekers and just recap to catch up because I simply can’t stand it. And I believe except for her every single person on every table understands this concept. This is not just a home game people play for their own enjoyment and just happens to be streamed. This is a quality production. People are not there to be charmed by any single character, they are there to watch a story unfold. When meaningless rambling overshadows the story I believe there is a problem. One of Jester’s core quirks as a character was rambling and talking a lot but Laura could stay silent when others were having a scene. Let me say this I have no problem with her as a person. When it is a collaborative scene where everyone gets the spotlight it really works well. She is a good player. Its just she NEVER shuts up.

The game was kinda an RPG but it was a little open ended, a bit weird, but the striking thing I remember about is that literally almost all the assets were flat. Like clip art. I'm talking everything. The monsters. The world map. Items. Equipment. Everything. Some of it was cartoony, but some of it was realistic clip art images. Kinda an absolute mess of Art assets, none of it was cohesive in any way, so it's not like it had a unified style. One minute you'd be fighting cartoon bunnies, the next you're fighting clip art of a real looking dresser. I don't think it was an RPG Maker game. Probably is from before the time of RPGmaker I probably got it off some weird shareware website like Happy puppy or something. for what it's worth, when I googled it some people came up with RM color magic on this sub years ago, and that's not it. submitted by /u/EXSource to r/tipofmyjoystick [link] [comments]",

Why I don't switch careers? I tried freelancing but I mostly got scam offers that wasted my time.
