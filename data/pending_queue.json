      "content": "Hello, everyone My username is Whitewdow but I also went under different usernames such as Extraditions and Sunwars2. I’ve managed games and big groups from 2009 to now and got featured on Roblox blog between 2013-2016. I am a UGC creator that has been a member of Roblox since 2009. I have had no outstanding violations since becoming a member. Yesterday, three of my accounts were suddenly banned under the reason of extremism/terrorism. I reached out to support and just kept getting AI responses. I’ve noticed that many users also got flagged and terminated. It hurts my heart because this was an account I had for 17 years and they did not give me a chance to appeal. Now I fear my account and memories are gone forever. I’ve reached out to the appeal page, customer phone number, info@roblox and even devrelations but still nothing. context on images: There was an 3 set armor pack that got moderated, made by me but uploaded as meshes by my friend. I have full rights to them and have them sold as UGC but Roblox said I misused the system. “Fourth Republic” was referring to a Star Wars group I was in many years ago. But Roblox most likely flagged it as N@zism and striked me. my ban reasons for misuse of systems stacked back to back and got my account deleted without letting me respond. this is a big issue with AI moderation and lack of customer service on ROBLOX’s part then slapping me with a “Terrorism/Extremism” ban reason without context or explanation just makes me hopeless. Does anyone else have this same issue as of recently? submitted by /u/Affectionate-Push487 to r/RobloxHelp [link] [comments]",

      "content": "I’m a Part-time Uber Eats/Door Dash cyclist who is currently making a living wage off of delivering food and small groceries to costumers. My reason for getting involved in Uber Eats delivery is due to the lack of employment in my area and the shortening gap of employment for part-time, inexperienced, youngsters. So, delivery/gig work was my way out of being penniless and to have money for anything. What I have realized about delivery/gig working on a bicycle is that it beings a lot of personal potential to people that want to make money to live comfortably, but also it is a huge, huge game changer in how we should view cities, even for non-cyclists. To improve the environment of which cyclists live that are infrastructure deserts. For some context, cycling is one of the most efficient vehicles ever invented despite the popularity of cars, and even motorcycles; it’s great to bypass through obstacles in catering within a high demand, higher paying urban center, it’s a huge economic net gain for both the cyclist and the businesses providing services. It provides some incentives for cities to overlook the rise of cycling in streets, especially for people looking to gain wealth while unemployed or to get more exercise from cycling while earning money. So that would incentivize in building new cycling infrastructure; making sure that those cycling routes are able to serve underserved communities; it’s a huge economic boost if built near high demand areas. That can improve the quality of life for the cyclists that are catering for a living if cycling infrastructure is considered, but even if no cycling infrastructure is considered besides one sidewalk or a faded bike lane, the economic benefits are still there. Not even just for the community receiving a surplus from a higher yield, but also for the people making a decent living from cycling. In short, think that Uber Eats/Door Dash cycling is a great opportunity for a many things that you can do with. Whether you just want to make a living or go out being an activism by any means. submitted by /u/ArgentMystic to r/fuckcars [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Weird place for me 25M and my now ex gf 24F. Where do we go from here? Edit: added TL;DR So I have been going through some stuff lately. Warning, long, long post. TL;DR at the bottom Part 1: the love of my life I have been with my ex partner for about 7.5 years, since she was 16 and me 17. We were schoolmates and knew each other for 5 years before we hit it off already. I had exited my last relationship of a year and a half for about 8 months before that due to toxicity between us, stemming mostly from incompatibility and some deep seated trauma in both of us, and in that period I tried stuff and hit it up with some girls, but nothing serious. I decided I wanted to be with someone again, but this time I m someone who better fitted me, and in my searching she drew my interest, and I got to know her and she frankly amazed me. She was (and still is) such a great person, with interests and passion, and I felt something greater than just some interest. It felt like she was... Extra special, you know? And so we hit it off. We were dance partners already, so the chemistry slowly grew on its own, and he finally hit it off on a school trip where we got together. And ever since, I had the best relationship I could dream of. It started as it normally would with getting to know each other really well, going on fun activities, spending time together, sexy times, the works. We grew on each other, and really, *really* loved each other. We met each other's families, vacations, trips together with our dancing and our music teams, shared hobbies and interests, gaming, and slowly getting so close to one another where she spent more time at my house rather than hers. She was also there for me at my lowest times in my life. Though I visited a psychologist for some time and solved some issues, I would say that it was mostly thanks to her that I overcame some issues like fear of abandonment due to my parents breaking up in my early teens and them being toxic and creating a toxic family enviroment for me and my brother. I was welcomed into her family where I saw a way better working systems of support and love between the members there, and began to see an example of how things could be. It brought hope to my heart, man! And I started from relatively early on, about 3-4 years on, of how growing old with this woman would feel. I started making dreams with her. I know i know, we're too young for stuff like that, and I agree with you, but we both started thinking about how it would be to raise a home together, a family, with a dog and have little pitter patter of feet running around us. Slowly she spent 5+ days straight at my home, and due to certain circumstamces I happened to have the opportunity to keep the family home to myself since everyone else moved away. And so I did, and she instantly moved in with me, making this house into a couple's home. It was true love, and it was amazing. We cared for my elderly dog, and lately even got a new puppy Of course things were not all good. Like relationships, we had our issues. We sometimes fought, we disagreed on stuff, and we definitely were a bit different as persons, but for me that was not a bad thing. She is a very carefree girl who, on the one hand helped me enjoy situations a bit more and taught me to take my overthinking mind off of stuff for a little while, but that also means that she was carefree in some situations that warranted some more attention and seriousness. And me on the other hand, I was always thinking ahead so as to always be on top of things which has helped in many, many scenarios in these last 10 years where I had to be mature as an adult even though I was just a teenager, but it also meant that I would tend to be more serious in situations that didn't need it, being a killjoy sometimes, and most importantly, trying to \"help her\" grow up in some stuff that needed her to be mature about them, as in government stuff, uni, degrees and everyday commonsense in some bad stuff she did absentmindedly (e.g. she once forgot the dog in the apartment building elevator for like an hour and we got yelled at by neighbors), which may have sometimes come off as pushy or overbearing. Add to that that I am overweight and due to clinical depression lost part of my libido for about 3+ years, and that she is a fairly sexual person with kinks that I couldn't get behind like BDSM and CNC, which I of course didn't judge, but simply couldn't offer her. I tried as much as I could to give her good passionate hugging (hey Rslash) but of course it wasn't good enough for her, and I do realize that and wish I could have been better. I have kinks of my own that she can't offer me as well but I probably don't need it as much as her. And also some loss of affection from me mostly as the relationship went on, not because I didn't love her but because I grew tired with life. I gave her lots of affection, but for example after covid I stopped going dancing with her and she felt hurt, because to her eyes I was her \"dance partner in life\". At the time I couldn't manage at all, I was all up in my head with some other stuff that was troubling me and a toxic home situation with my family that I was living with. It's just that, little pieces of tiredness between us that slowly chipped away at the passion of the relationship and made us feel a bit stale and closed in. The love was extremely much there, we loved (and still do) each other up to our heads, but the relationship started to feel like it stagnated and like we were 40 years old. It felt like we were on the right moment for a bit of an older couple to actually plan for marriage or kids, but we both felt a bit too young for that. I wanted it with her, i *dreamt* it with her, just maybe not in this exact time. And for her it must have been even worse, because at least I had the opportunity to love deeply before, to experience a breakup, to mess around unseriously with girls, and also for my personal life to figure out through the years who I am and who I want to be, having also competed in music competitions, been in bands, traveled part of the world through my work as a musician and my passion, found a job in my field, and becoming a volunteer firefighter and becoming a part of a group of people like me who understand the way I feel. For her, she lived a normal life up until graduation, and then simply existed in the premises of her relationship with me and the stuff we did together. I always told her she should open more and make an effort to be active in her own interests and her social life, but she never quite managed to do that. I tried to help her by introducing her to my music groups and social groups, and indeed through that we went on trips and made many experiences, but she never realy blossomed beyond that. It was mostly things we did together, just like that dance team we were a part of at the start of our relationship. After I exited the team due to personal reasons, she did too, although she didn't need or want to. She could have continued on her passion of dancing on her own even if she preferred it with me, I believe. And she didn't have any real friends that she talked with or made plans with, only people from those groups who interacted mainly with me and her by extension Part 2: the bestfriend Enter throughout all that a third player, my uni bestfriend of 6 years who I felt very close from the beginning. We were there for each other, and have helped each other a lot through many stuff, like helping each other cope through family problems, listening to each other when one needed an ear, going out and making experiences, money issues like lending money when one needed to, and helping each other advance our careers in our industry by mutual support. I helped him a step up, and he did the next. That kinda thing. One of his main quirks, to put it bluntly, was that he is pretty choosy in his choice of women to date. He had an active relationship life when he lived in his village, but after turning 18 and going to the big city to get in university (where we met) he only had in all the years i've known him less than 10 relationships, all of which ended before long and who he didn't reach any significant level of intimacy, either sexually or emotionally. It always seemed weird with me, but I let him be and just mocked him for always attracting virgin girls instead of experianced ones like he said he wanted (as any friend should). Through the years he ended up becoming an integral part of my social life. We ended up hanging around a lot, even when we weren't together we often played online games. It was fun. Slowly my gf started joing us in all that, and the relationship between all evolved to a kind of triad that felt pretty secure and fun to be in. We went on vacation together, we celebrated birthdays, we did group projects, many long nights of gaming, going drifting (guy had a bmw), and generally many stuff together. He was fun to be around, and I could see that he felt really well as well being part of this, just like my girl. Part 3: the fuckening As I was saying, slowly through the years the relationship with my gf was a bit strained due to daily life getting to the both of us, but we persevered. Sexually speaking we were in a closed relationship but with freedom of talking around online or maybe getting into threesomes or group stuff etc, but only if the other agree as well. We had done some stuff, and in 2 occasions the bestfriend was part of a bit of play as well. The limits were though that they were to do nothing alone with each other, and they kept that limit for most of our time knowing each other. The first incident happened about a year and a half ago, where I had just fiercely fought with my brother about us not being able to handle each other as roommates, about morals and other stuff, and we ended up \"breaking up\" our roommate relationship and him leaving for a new home. It was a hard time for reasons I won't specify but that went hand to hand with my older trauma and the aforementioned toxic family relations after my dad exited the family and left my mom with 2 kids alone. Not precisely an abusive situation, but surely very bad emotions at play. So at this period my bestfriend visited my house (where my gf had only recently moved in for good) for a fun evening of board games and some alcoholic beverage mixing for them (I don't really drink alcohol). I had to leave for a work incident for about 2 hours, but would be back to rejoin them pretty soon. After it was handled, I came back to see them both sitting on MY bed, looking extremely upset and guilty, where they told my that they messed up and went over the limit and she gave him a handjob while he was touching her. I got very mad, and left the house for some clean air. I was severely upset, but I tend to be non confrontational for some reason, and to always go above and beyond and understand the reasons behind it. I sat them down, we talked, asked them precisely how they thought they messed up, and explained how it made me feel. They both apologized profusely, and accepted all I had to say about it. I set some pretty clear boundaries about the limits of our relationship, mostly that he doesn't get to do anything with her ever again and that they are to stay purely platonical friends. They accepted and we moved on. Things ran relatively smoothly after that. Me and my gf continued getting our house to feel like home, and the bestfriend did his stuff and we all hanged around sometimes. Easy stuff. The start of the end: About 4 months ago, me and my partner decided to get a puppy, since senior dog had started deteriorating and I hoped the pup would inherit some of his good traits (success!). Sadly the old pup had cancer, and his days were numbered. About a month after we found out, it progressed to a stage where I needed to make a very tough decision. I was a mess at that time. Absolute mess. I woke up every day the last 2 weeks of it trying to find even a glimpse of hope, of him getting a bit better, but seeing him get weaker by the day. I was feeling like I was run over by a train. I was about to lose my doggo best friend of 14 years. I was *crushed*. The day I put him down, my heart ripped in two, and I buried one of those parts with him. I was holding him while the vet did the injection, and felt his breathing stop. Ruined, i'm telling you. Of course by this point I was unable to provide psychologically for my relationship, and I was not in a point of handling executive decision making. Exactly after the day my dog died, my gf started visiting my bestfriend's house, or constantly bringing him to our house. For the first time ever our work programs aligned and we had 2 consecutive days of the week off, and could spend them together. I was in no position to do that, having just lost my dog, but in that time my gf seemed... Weird. Done with stuff. Tired of trying to carry the burden of my feelings. I totally get it, sucks to have a partner with such drama in his life, but in most cases... That's life. She had the luck to live a more stress free childhood age so I can't blame her for feeling tired having carried my up to my dog's death, she needed rest. By this time she had found a bestfriend in my bestfriend. They went shopping, car rides, coffee, mini dates, frankly. I wasn't blind, it stank to me. I told my gf that I wasn't very good about what I was seeing. She swore she just finally found a friend, someone who understands her in some parts that she has never felt understood. But I told her I still don't like it, and that in any case i'm her boyfriend and really need her to be here and want her company. She relented somewhat and didn't go nearly at all, but he still came by sometimes. I told her I still didn't care to see him and she was like ok then you can tell me and we will go somewhere outside not to upset you. She didn't feel anything wrong with that. In her mind she just really found a friend. How wrong that was At this period, from the point my dog died, I decided I was done feeling down. I started taking care of stuff again. More housework, more Normal work to make some bank, and more trying for her, both emotionally and sexually, as much as I could give. I finally saw her tired and needing a vacation, and thought i could burden her no longer. I wanted, needed, to be the guy I know I am once more, and to get out of this constant feeling of feeling down. One could see this as lovebombing from seeing my relationshio go down a wrong path, but it really was not. I was in this attempt from the moment we moved in together alone about 1.5 years ago, but I also felt burdened from the betrayal of that one night they messed up and could not give it all. Still tried to give it my best though. And in these last two months I really tried being there for here, but she wouldn't even recognize the effort. She saw it, but it never registered to her. About a month ago, my gf calmly told me that she was thinking about the prospect of a polyamorous relationship. I asked if it was about my bestfriend, she said yeah. I shut that down, HARD. It was the first time since the incident showing clear intent and feelings, and wanted to shut it down as best as I could And it all boiled down to about 10 days ago. She told me that she loves me very much, but she doesn't know if that's enough for her anymore. I freaked out. I had a premonition, almost sure of what it was, but that's all she said. I kept on pressing her to tell me what's wrong, to communicate, to give us a chance to try harder, to go to therapy, and she kept rejecting all i said. Two days later, by bestfriend and I met up at a job and talked a bit, and he said that he has feelings for my gf and that he feels like he should take his distance from both of us. He said he loves us both very much, and doesn't want his feelings to cause a problem. I accepted that, appreciated his honesty and his mature approach about it, and bade him an emotional farewell. He said he would come by and tell my gf too. I went back home, and waited. When she came home she cried. She said she was sad. I asked if she had feelings too, she didn't answer. Next day I had work and came home a crying mess. Almost didn't make the day. I sat her down and we talked. Really, really talked, and she finally let me off the hook and told me she has feelings about my best friend. In the moment i was relieved. I finally knew what it was, clearly. The veil had been lifted and it was all up in the air. I was relieved. But the next morning was hell. I tried to ask her about her feelings. She said she loves me, but she loves him too. And that she doesn't see a future with me as much as she sees a future with him. I was shaken. Couldn't really believe what I was hearing. Up until 3 months ago we were frivolously talking about our future. We got a dog, god dammit. How could she suddenly change in 3 months from seeing and building a future with me, to feeling disappointed and letting 7.5 years of love just end. And what about all we dreamt of only weeks ago? She never gave me an indication besides what was mentioned above. Besides having him around often, that's all she showed me. She kept talking about stuff she wanted us to do, how we should paint the house, upcoming plans in a couple of months and how we should handle them, trips, everything. I got a motorcycle and just a month ago she got a helmet because she wanted to ride pillion with me. And it was colour and designed matched to mine as well. A mere MONTH before all this. She did however stop talking about some of her problems with our relationship after my dog died. I thought it was because she tried not to burden me but i was wrong. Then, 3 days ago, I opened her phone (I know, violation of privacy, sue me. She was hiding stuff) and i saw that she was STILL messaging my bestfriend and even exchanged spicy pics just the day before. You know, the day I was having an anxiety attack at work. I apologized for the way I found out, she accepted, but tried to figure out her feelings. Was it really love? Was it excitement? Did she mentally check out from our relationship and just find the next one? Was he just using her? Was she using him? I think I ended up with more questions than answers. And that asshole! He was saying stuff like \"yeah it's unethical to OP and it might be obsession, but what's wrong with that? That's how love works, i feel some way, and I act on it. If my mom died I would be upset and act on it, so why shouldn't I do it with this issue\". He found nothing wrong with sexting with his best friend's girlfriend because \"he has feelings\". Says is unethical to me but is excused due to the feelings. And of course he's not alone. She also did that, and she was active in those decisions. She started texting him after he took distance. So she is a cheater, and he is a snake. Of course, though we were talking about taking a break, some distance, but not breaking up, we decided it would maybe be best to pull the trigger and end it I instantly removed him from my life. Removed him from socials, and only kept him in the work group chat for logistical reasons. But I can't for the life of me remove her. I can't hate her. She was my life, and honestly though stuff has happened this last year, and there *were* a couple problems before, I did choose her, and want to still be beside her. Don't get me wrong, I am very much hurt by her actions and even if she came back now I would need her to work hard to make this right, but I would definitely give us a try Final part: after thoughts : I like to divide in my mind the problem at hand as 3 different issues combined together in one big fumbled mess. It's a triad consisting of these: 1-We had problems from 7.5 years of love but also mini daily clashes and especially after living together that's magnified. But that to my eyes is always worth trying for. We never became toxic to each other in daily life, and were always calm and loving to each other. We cared for each other and showed it, but never really put in the correct effort to solve the issues, as in going to a licensed therapist or a couple's councilor to talk honestly and clearly with someone who could guide us to solving these issues in a loving and productive manner 2-Let's be honest. We got together *young*. Maybe it was bound for us to break up from the beginning, at least for a time. I was her first relationship, and she never really evolved her own self identity inside it. She grew, and she evolved from a great teen to a wonderful adult through it and everybody, *everybody* in our lives loves her, but she was molded by our relationship. Not from me being pushy about it, just that you naturally get some traits from your partner when in a relationship. She needed to stay alone a bit, gather experiences, do stupid stuff, cry, laugh, and find her own self identity. Sincerely in my eyes we are a perfect relationship, a perfect couple, for a tiny bit later in life, maybe 30, where we will be ready for a family, but not for right now where we need to gather experiences and learn our lessons. And again, I have been lucky to already have gathered a lot of it from an early age and wouldn't mind *as much* to settle, and I STILL struggle with it. Imagine with someone who feels they haven't found their self identity yet 3-The ex bestfriend. She got close to him -as a friend, at least in her mind (and maybe even his)- but she experienced stuff you usually do in a new relationships. Shopping, mini dates, coffe dates, game nights, board games, small trips. I was there for most of them since we usually went all together, but maybe she kind of cut me out in her head and focused on what *he* provided for her, even though it wasn't like this. He's the only one who's close to her in her life in a more close manner, since all other \"friends\" she has are just colleagues or generally people she doesn't socialize with. So more like just people she knows, not friends she can share deep feelings with. I think she finally felt a genuine connection that one would have with a friend and due to the other 2 reasons mentioned above applied and evolved it to actual feelings for him, or at least an idealized idea of him. Sincerely I'm not sure she truly wants him or just the idealized version if him. Cause the feeling of eros is the first that fades when life enters the relationship. The first moments are great. Activities, late night talks, passion, fun dates, getting to really know each other, but what happens when there's not enough money for rent and you have to cut back? What happens when life gets tough and the other person is not the sweet prince you fell in love with. In that moment eros, passion, leaves, and love perseveres. It takes effort to go through that point. How can she say that she dreams a life with him, when the feelings only recently appeared? She knew him from before, yeah, but she also knew me from before. She says that she feels how she felt about me when we started but 4 times as hard about him. How can this be in just 2 months. And even with dreams of the future with kids and stuff. And how can she abandon her previous love of her life with her new dog, and leave the home we were making. Anyway right now she's back at her parent's house. She moved out of mine. Of *ours*. Or at least slowly doing so, since she has a house worth of stuff which needs days to be moved completely, until which time is staying at my place. We both have appointments to psychologists, and we're both gonna stay alone for some time, or at least try to, and see how it goes. In my mind it's 99% sure that she's gonna jump into a relationship with him. I hope for her good that she at least waits and talks it up with therapist a bit before deciding to do so because she'll just be jumping from one problematic relationship to another. I love her. I love very much. It hurts very much since it kiiiiinda came out of nowhere for me. It didn't, but i didn't want to think it would reach this point. I know it's too soon and that I haven't even had time to really process my feelings, but I really want to at some point get it working together with her again. I'm not a kid, I know she has to get her mind sorted, get her life sorted before that, and I definitely need to work with myself, rediscover my active and happy personality that was buried for some time. Most will probably tell me to get a move and don't look back, but I don't think I will just let it go. I'm open to whatever chances life throws at me, and if I happen to meet a girl (or 10) then I won't stop myself from living it if it feels right for me, but I don't think I want to kill the dream of a married life with her. As parents of a happy family. I sincerely believe and want to believe that at some point after we both live a couple of stuff, that life will see that we're ready and bring us together and that then it'll work, as it did once before. We'll both get it out of our system, and we'll be clear minded to continue on. I think I can forgive her for how she treated me this last 2-4 months, though she must try, and i'm ready to meet again the new person that will become of her. She was wonderful in these last 14 years i've known her. I don't think she's acting with a sound mind these last months, and regardless of that, when we're ready with therapy i'd love to go to a theraoist together with her and just... Talk it out. Not to get together again, though always an option if we're both ready, but just to talk it out and end in in clear and good terms. We can't leave each other's lives completely, for some reasons, but regardless of the outcome I'd love to be okay with her and work with her in the times we're together. And if the time is right, even maybe see about us What's your opinion? TL;DR: my partner of 7 years and me dreamt of a life together, but had some issues in our otherwise extremely loving relationship, we grew slowly apart due to everyday stress, and my snake of a bestfriend and her have developed feelings for each other while we were still together. We might have needed to break up at some point regardless since we got together at an early age and both need more experiances in life before settling in together, but right now she's rejecting our relationship and the future we were dreaming up until very recently. Should I give up on my dream or should I keep in as a hope in the back side of my mind, while also not stopping myself from moving forward in life and perhaps meeting someone who fits me better. And if life does bring us together again, and we're ready and have forgiven each other, should I do it? submitted by /u/ItsMisterNewVegas to r/BreakUps [link] [comments]",

      "content": "I’ve been sitting with this thought for a while: Solo development is kind of a trap, but it's often the only door that’s actually open. ​Maybe this is a bit of a rant, but I feel like ideally, nobody should be doing this alone. It’s inherently inefficient. You’re forced to be the programmer, the artist, the systems architect, the economist, and the writer. It’s a recipe for a ceiling on quality because a single person can rarely provide the same specialized value as a team of experts in each of those pillars. ​But for most of us, there’s no other way. Unless you have a massive inheritance or hit the investor lottery, you’re starting with a budget of zero (or negative). Finding a partner who is actually reliable and shares your vision—without asking for a salary you can’t pay—is like finding a unicorn. ​The part that really hits hard is the time it takes to actually reach professional standards. Between learning, failing, and finally getting the project to the level of quality you want to deliver, you accumulate a massive debt of \"free labor.\" We often don't calculate the real value of our time, but by the time the product is finished, you've invested years of professional-grade work for $0. It’s a huge financial and personal risk that we only accept because we have no other choice. ​I feel like we often lie to ourselves with this idea of being the \"sole creator.\" It’s a way to justify our need for control over something that, by nature, should be a collaborative effort. We cling to that control because it's the only thing we actually have when we don't have a budget. ​Does anyone else feel like a developer is often forced into solo development by necessity rather than choice? At what point did you realize the sheer amount of \"free work\" you were sinking into your own project? submitted by /u/Maleficent_Affect_93 [link] [comments]",

I have always casually been into coding and tech ever since I was kid, so I went to a coding bootcamp and taught myself various languages before building a portfolio and applying to jobs. Now, I've been a software engineer for 2 years and I finally feel like I can be myself and am happy. I should have realized it before, but the truth is my social skills aren't naturally great. I forced myself to develop EQ and improve, but my natural, authentic self is a socially awkward person. I'm OK with that. You can't judge a fish's worth by its ability to climb a tree, and that's what my old jobs were doing. I'm also much more introverted and nerdy in my natural self. I love reading books, watching TV, playing video games, and being solitary. Third, my brain loves the technical aspects of life, it stimulates me in a way no other job did. Consulting casing felt like that, but the actual job was far more mundane. Fourth, I actually like my co-workers. They are quirky and strange, but so I am, and I finally feel like I don't have to put on a front. We also have similarly nerdy interests and they invite me to stuff. All in all, I feel a lot happier.

      "content": "Patent-pending Wi-Fi–assisted cellular positioning delivers up to 50-foot indoor accuracy and multi-year battery life without costly beacon grids or camera-based systems EDMONTON, Alberta, Jan. 27, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Agereh Technologies Inc. ( “Agereh” or the “Company” ) (TSXV: AUTO | OTCQB: CRBAF ), a Canadian-based artificial intelligence and advanced technology company delivering AI-enabled platforms and sensor solutions to address critical challenges in the transportation industry, is pleased to announce the launch of MapNTrack™, providing an indoor/outdoor asset visibility solution designed to help transportation hubs track and manage mobile equipment across complex indoor/outdoor environments where traditional tracking technologies often fail. Transportation hubs today operate at volumes and complexity far beyond what many legacy monitoring systems were built to support. Standard cellular positioning can be too imprecise for operational decision-making, GPS performance often degrades indoors, and Bluetooth or LoRa-based approaches may require extensive beacon infrastructure that is expensive to deploy and maintain. Camera-based tracking can introduce additional constraints, including line-of-sight limitations, sensitivity to lighting and obstruction, and ongoing privacy and compliance considerations. These limitations can result in fragmented visibility across operations. Large transportation hubs manage thousands of mobile assets—ranging from wheelchairs and service carts to ground-support equipment—yet without reliable real-time location intelligence, critical equipment can go missing, remain idle in inactive zones, or be replaced prematurely. Industry analyses indicate that inefficiencies in asset availability and unplanned equipment replacement can cost millions of dollars annually. “Transportation hubs need real-time operational intelligence, not fragmented visibility,” said Ken Brizel, CEO of Agereh. “MapNTrack™ was purpose-built for complex indoor or outdoor environments where GPS and legacy systems fall short, giving operations teams the accuracy and reliability they need to keep assets moving, reduce delays, improve operational efficiency and the passenger experience.” Launch of MapNTrack™ MapNTrack™ was developed to address these operational gaps to improve operational performance. Built for large, high-traffic facilities spanning indoor and outdoor zones, MapNTrack™ leverages cellular and Wi-Fi infrastructure to deliver real-time intelligence without requiring a retrofit of consumer networks or deploying large beacon grids. At the core of MapNTrack™ is Agereh’s patent-pending Wi-Fi–assisted cellular positioning technology, engineered specifically for indoor/outdoor asset tracking. MapNTrack™ devices provide indoor location accuracy of up to 50 feet after mapping, are coin cell battery powered, and offer up to three years of operational life, enabling scalable deployment across terminals, hangars, and maintenance areas. With MapNTrack™, transportation hubs can: Reduce delays and improve turnaround times Minimize time spent searching for equipment Improve asset utilization and availability Support compliance with safety and operational standards About Agereh Technologies Inc. Agereh Technologies Inc. (TSXV: AUTO | OTCQB: CRBAF) is a Canadian-based artificial intelligence and advanced technology company delivering AI-enabled platforms and sensor solutions to address critical challenges in the transportation industry. By combining accurate data collection, predictive intelligence, and data-driven decision-making for transportation and infrastructure applications, Agereh continues to expand its portfolio with solutions designed to enhance efficiency, optimize operations, and enable the next generation of intelligent transportation systems. submitted by /u/Fluffy-Lead6201 to r/Stocks_Picks [link] [comments]",

      "content": "PS5 player here. On Tuesday, I purchased the Stranger Things Chapter, along with 2 auric cell packs to buy some cosmetics. I purchased a $9.99 pack, bought some cosmetics, and then I purchased another $19.99 pack because I only had 575 cells and wanted to buy more. However, after purchasing the second pack, I received a “sync error” message stating the transaction failed. On PlayStation, the transaction is showing as completed, and I was charged. However, the auric cells have yet to show up in my account. I contacted BHVR and received a response with instructions. I followed them all, closed the game and restarted the console, revisited the store, and nothing worked. I went into my PS settings and restored the license, turned off console sharing. It’s been several days and my cells still aren’t appearing. I contacted BHVR again and instead of responding, they closed my case and marked it as “solved.” I have sent several emails and have yet to hear back. I visited BHVR’s site and they have a statement that they’re aware some auric cells purchases got messed up on Tuesday. They also state there is nothing they can do, they cannot manually load cells (which is definitely not true), and to reach out to PlayStation for a refund. On the PS app, it states that add-on purchases like this are not available for a refund. I got in contact with an agent and they informed me the transaction went through, and it appears that the content was loaded correctly. However, I still only have 575 cells, and have yet to receive a response from BHVR. My case had to be escalated through PlayStation. This entire experience has been needlessly frustrating as BHVR didn’t really do anything and closed my case. Has anyone else experienced this?

      "content": "Hey everyone 👋 So, long story short: I’ve been working on my dream game for several years now (and honestly, thinking about it for much longer - probably around 15 years :D). We’ve just launched our Steam page, and sometime this year - maybe even within the next six months - we’re planning to release an early version. At its core, the idea is simple: you build your dream home and then play board games inside it with your friends. But the bigger vision is to grow this into a full-fledged game and social platform. The long-term (almost insane) vision is to create something like a new reality: a place I could live in when my physical body no longer functions. You know… bringing the Ring to Orodruin, and all that. :D The concept is that inside homespaces (yes, it's a new word) you’ll be able to play mini-games that can be sold through an internal marketplace. That means any Unreal developer could potentially build things together with us. In the long run, it won’t be just mini-games — they'll be able to sell spaces, modules, or plugin-like systems as well. So: I’d really love to hear your thoughts on the idea itself. If you can support us in any way - that would mean a lot. And if you’re an Unreal developer - let’s build something together! To be honest, right now we mostly need as many mini-games as possible, and we’re ready to sell them with basically no conditions, except whatever requirements the publisher (and Steam) might introduce later. submitted by /u/General-Lock-1079 [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Hello, I am novice indie dev who has until now launched 2 upcoming steam pages with 2 released demos. In about a month I'll launch my 3rd upcoming steam page of my extended version of the 3 years old horror game that got me 20k downloads on Itch.io. As this was and still is my most successful project I have ever made I want to do this release as best as I can. I don't have an existing following on social media and I know a push to the audience won't make much sense. Although I know I can pitch the game later on and get a lot of Youtubers to cover it because they liked the previous version. What do you think is the best idea to handle the launch of the steam page? Some of my current ideas include: - Make a button on my itch version that directs to the upcoming steam page (I get there 4-10 views per day + 1-4 downloads per day - not much, but some traffic) - Make an update post on my old itch version directing the followers from my account to the new steam page - Contact IGN(GameTrailers) and Indie Games Hub prior and ask them to post the announce trailer on the day I release the page - Contact some press outlets and creators who cover upcoming games (I have never gotten luck with this step but maybe this time I will be lucky) - Promote the game hard on Reddit / Facebook / Linkdin groups on the day the steam page launches - Post consistently content every day for at least one week on my socials (Tiktok, Instagram, Youtube shorts) - Share to all my friends Do you think this is a good strategy for launching the steam page? Would you do anything differently? submitted by /u/Equivalent-Charge478 [link] [comments]",

      "content": "I mean I have been playing the game for a while now and I have to admit it's getting hard to find the \"romance\" in romance club anymore. I mean yes i expect a good storyline with equally good romance but the current stories barely have any romance in it... Look I get it i read the new \"code blue book\" and yeah it's cute has a good plotline keeps you hooked sometimes it's starts to feel like some greys anatomy or something but it kept me hooked... But where the hell was the romance I mean we completed an entire season there was no sign of romance anywhere mostly k went the Tobias route didn't find any but when there was the cafe owner guy I'm so sorry i forgot his name he has a kid .... I can't remeber that charectors name...we kinda see romance, but if we don't want to go his route we don't get it same is the route for gail... For me i think if we decide to pursue any charector the romance or the intensity or even a hint of romance should almost be equal ik ik doffrest charectors different personalities and all that but yeah it's not like if u give romance to one charector u don't give it to another.... Another example is the heavens secret series the season 3... It's been kind of disspointing it's the same issue here if u go the malbonte part u barely have any scenes of malbonte and like basically nonnexistent romance considering that malbonge and vicky are married.... And if u go the lucifer route u get ample of romance and lucifer scenes .... Same for lanes story if u go cains route u get little to zero interaction or affection and if u do dimitrys route u get a little romance a little affection... Plus the constant bugs and glitches in the app and just for a basic scene I'm not willing to offer 150 diamonds.... That's why people now prefer playing during diamond rush but also diamond rush days are not set or sometimes there is no diamond rush just decide and set it. And ik ik we are all humans and the creators are humans and I love them their stories their hard work and everything but when like they tell us an update will take some more time than what we were informed... I mean atleast give us a slight idea of how long it will take so we have a slight inkling and we won't feel heartbroken.... submitted by /u/Sure_Weekend6952 to r/RomanceClub [link] [comments]",

We’ve added support for an early, unreleased version of Atari’s Relief Pitcher running on their System 1 platform. Moon Raker, a Nichibutsu shooter from the late ’70s, has also been found and emulated. Sega’s Waku Waku series has been further filled out with the addition of Waku Waku Jumbo. And for something completely different, Apple’s first computer built around the WIMP paradigm, the Lisa, is starting the year in substantially better shape. If you play arcade games that utilised lightguns, you’ll no doubt be aware that pulling the trigger while aiming the gun away from the screen was a common way to reload. You may also be aware that MAME had an option to make this a bit easier if you’re using a lightgun to play. That option has been removed, with a new plugin taking its place. The great news is that the plugin works even if you aren’t using a lightgun . That’s right, you can now assign a button to reload when you’re playing Virtua Cop or Lethal Enforcers with a keyboard, mouse or trackball. Check the plugin documentation for more details. The Hanimex Pencil II computer has had a bit of an overhaul, which should make more software usable. A few more of the many BBC Micro peripherals have been emulated. Other improvements this month include better Apple IIgs periodic interrupt emulation, another working Apple II clone from behind the Iron Curtain, better representation of base Grid Compass hardware configurations, and better default sound routing for people using Apple notebook computers. As always, you can read about everything that changed this month in the whatsnew.txt file , and the source code and 64-bit Windows binary packages are linked from our download page .

      "content": "Basically after missing one chest, I remember accidentally using one Keen detector on the main AIC area. It does the scan radius animation on the map but I didn't pay attention on what was highlighted before going back to my stash(n key) to check what just happened. Now after knowing what it does(after some googling) I burnt through every Keen detector on every tp point on The Hub map, but all I get is \"target not detected\" without the map scan animation playing. I tested it on the other region, if the chest is there the scan animation will play on the map, highlighting a green chest marker. However on the hub area where I very clearly remembering the first one I accidentally used was on the Core AIC Area, where now I use the detector on, it gets used up saying no target detected. I wonder if this is a bug where the game thinks you already have the chest highlighted through the previous use of Keen detector on the area. But the marker itself disappear after logging off or something. Anyone had the same experience? I tried contacting the bot on customer support but no reply. Also PS: This is not the one missing chest or whatever in the underground area related to the invisible glyph questlines, I have finished all of them. This is the only chest missing in the entirety of Valley IV and it's driving me crazy. submitted by /u/I-T-Y to r/Endfield [link] [comments]",

I can see him wanting to go from a 12th seed East team... to an 8th seed West team -- A team that's precisely missing one Giannis... to be amazing. Here's what the Bucks would get for Giannis: - 4 draft picks, - Kuminga, - A presumably healthy Butler next year ...is an insanely valuable package for the bucks. The improvement the warriors started to see after adding Butler (who didn't particularly contribute a whole lot of more net points compared to Wiggins) was huge. He elevated the IQ of the young warriors players so much, that they've been able to win tough games without him. He's the perfect catalyst for a rebuild. Compared to the other viable trade options... I just don't think the Heat, Knicks, or Hawks have anything to offer on par with this. The Pistons, Thunder, and Spurs would make sene, but at this point in the season, it's like hitting on black-jack so to speak... why disrupt something that's working... I actually think the Warriors will be the long term losers here...

The characters are diverse and well-developed, and the story touches on real issues in a way that feels genuine and impactful. You can tell the devs put a lot of heart into making this a welcoming space. The dialogue feels natural, and the inclusion of trans characters isn’t just tokenism, it's meaningful and affirming. It’s honestly refreshing to see a game that not only entertains but also promotes empathy and understanding. I came away from it feeling hopeful. Not just for the future of the Dragon Age series, but for gaming as a whole. I can't wait to see what they do with the next Mass Effect! Hopefully it gets the same treatment! 🤗 submitted by /u/InformalFalcon226 to r/DragonAgeVeilguard [link] [comments]",

There’s a heavy, obsessive quality to the air that makes it hard for you to focus on your daily tasks. You might feel sudden waves of heat or anxiety that don't actually belong to you at all. It’s the feeling of being watched or wanted by someone who is finally admitting how much they crave you. They’re realizing that the distance hasn't made the feelings fade, it’s actually made them unbearable to live with. The energy is snapping from passive thinking into an urgent, undeniable need to be in your physical presence immediately. This isn't just a mental game anymore because the physical pull is becoming impossible to ignore or suppress.

The playtest is open and unlimited 2. Very little marketing done (announced in the discord and posted a single instagram and youtube shorts reel) 3. Game is multiplayer (coop) and requires at least 2 players, or up to 10, so likely going to have an incredibly high drop off of people joining, launching and then quitting 4. I have friend invites enabled 5. Running for 2 weeks only, not sure if this is standard practice I'm not sure how much is botted, or if that's even a thing with playtests the way it is with demos. I've hardly marketed the game or playtest so am just surprised, friend invites being sent and accepted to me means it can't all be bots. Interested to hear thoughts from folks who've run public playtests for their indie titles before. submitted by /u/itsamayo [link] [comments]",

I'm having a blast working on this project every small addition makes the world feel more alive and keeps me motivated to push forward. The lighting combined with the time cycle especially creates amazing atmosphere. Still learning Godot as I go, but the engine has been incredibly approachable.

She's a huge basketball fan, used to play it when she was younger before switching to volleyball. So she's pretty sporty. There's this player in the NBA that she used to go to middle school with and partially high school as well. She follows his career closely and a huge fan. She watches most of his games. Watches all his highlights on youtube. And she talks about him constantly. Always bringing up how he's always been \"him\" since childhood. She also follows him on social media. I see her liking his posts and leaving heart emojis. It feels like she is crushing on him and it's pissing me off. It's bad enough her fangirl shit already seems a bit over the top, but it's just the fact she actually knew him as well. And lord knows if they still keep in contact or not. Which she denies. Makes me paranoid. Obviously I've confronted her about it, told her it feels like she's crushing on dude and I don't like it. But she's accussing me of being insecure for nothing. She's allowed to support one of their \"hometown heroes\". And that I wouldn't get it, I'm not from her hometown and don't understand how loyalty runs deep with their people. I mean, yeah... i get it. I'm not from some crazy sports town on the eastcoast, regardless I think her behavior is inappropriate. We've gotten into a few arguments now over this. She tells me I'm overreacting but I don't think so. What should I do? submitted by /u/More-Archer-7776 to r/Advice [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Hi! I’m making a game about navigating a 1980s like computer with a text based interface, and it’s supposed to be a horror mystery. The player will find clues about a supernatural horror as they are reading text files and looking at a log file (accessible anywhere). There are sound effects simulating this old computer. I wonder what horrir elements I can add in this very barebones GUI? There are some tasks where the player needs to look into the log file to retrace their steps, and seeing log rows of another, unexpected user doing things on the computer is one thing I will explore. Another is that commands will have a different, more ominous sound effect than before. What ideas do you have for creating horror with just text and sound effects? submitted by /u/pimmen89 [link] [comments]",

I need to learn love. I'm going to cut myself and take ultra cold showers and not allow myself any comfort from now on. It sounds a bit extreme but at least this mindset will finally get me over my shitty addictions like weed porn shitty gacha games social media. It's not even that I think I deserve to suffer or whatever I just have to learn to love others more and put others before myself. Like my selfishness genuinely stops my close ones from having fun. And it even stops them from being safe and sound, I'm not reliable at all, but part of that might also be how irresponsible I am too, which is more reason to hate myself lol. I don't give a fk anymore about whatever trauma happened to me, it's no excuse for not loving people. I'm going to have to remove all sources of stupid comfort. I'm going to have to change this to the opposite of comfort. And also pick up hobbies and interests that allow me to love others. submitted by /u/SubstantialSmile5152 to r/depression [link] [comments]",

When the material is created, the standart option BACK is selected, but some body parts act like the FRONT option is selected instead. And it goes further: when i select the FRONT option, the bugged body part shows like the BACK options is selected. like it is inverted. To fix this you just have to disable the Cull Mode option. just like this And the model is fixed. submitted by /u/boombatis [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Hello everyone. I just released a mod called Hazardous Glowing Sea on Nexus Mods, which adds more creature spawns to the Glowing Sea region of Fallout 4. I encountered a couple other mods which do something similar, but I found them to be either a bit too much or not quite enough for my taste. So I made one that hopefully makes the Glowing Sea feel like more of a risk at virtually any level, without completely overwhelming the experience. Though, you can be overwhelmed. Think swarms and proliferation. More radroaches, bloodbugs, stingwings, bloatflies, and ghouls. I imagined they'd thrive in larger numbers rivaled only by other species. Some creatures level with you. Other stronger variants don't. Most use leveled lists so that spawns aren't exactly alike each time. There are a few unique variants of ghouls and behemoths as well and some I'll leave you to discover. Give it a shot and let me know what you think. Danger isn't everywhere you go, but you can be ambushed at any point, so bring plenty of stimpaks, radaway, and heavy artillery.

The last 2 years were especially busy, as our team grew to up to 12 people at some point in development. This VR shooter, where you fight vampires with sci-fi tech and dark powers, has been a labor of passion. When we launched our game into Early Access at the end of August, we were full of hope. But the reception was a wake-up call. Many players rightly pointed out that the game wasn’t where it needed to be in terms of polish, balance, or content. It was disappointing to realize we’d missed the mark. But instead of backing down, we got to work. We’ve spent the past 5 months addressing every issue, implementing major overhauls, and reworking core systems based on player feedback. We’re proud to say the game has improved dramatically, and we’ve finally made the game we believe is truly worthy of a full release.

      "content": "Hello everyone, I’d like to share a project I’ve been developing completely on my own. The game is called Bloody Fate. Bloody Fate is a single-player, story-driven action shooter set in Sicily. It is not an open-world game — the focus is on narrative, atmosphere, and character-driven progression. The story follows Leo, a man who arrives in Sicily after the death of his father. Hoping to leave his past behind, he opens a small grocery store and tries to start a quiet new life. However, the region’s criminal networks soon pull him into a world he never wanted to be part of. Every decision he makes to survive pushes him deeper into an irreversible path within the mafia underworld. The game features: First-person and third-person perspectives Narrative-driven missions and dialogue Cinematic, mission-based combat A dark, serious mafia and revenge theme I’m developing this project entirely solo, handling programming, design, and story myself. My goal isn’t scale, but to deliver a focused, memorable story with a strong atmosphere. Feedback, thoughts, and criticism are more than welcome. Thanks for taking the time to check it out. Wishlist on Steam If Bloody Fate caught your interest, you can support the project by adding it to your Steam Wishlist. Every wishlist really helps a solo developer and makes a huge difference submitted by /u/Particular_Mine_4189 [link] [comments]",

Back in the day, it was the only epic I had that I got to level 8 after getting an ungodly amount from a super magical chest. And even without playing for years at a time, I have a level 16 Golem somehow. Anyways, I love playing Golem first play. If I don't see Golem in my starting hand, I am disappointed. I love putting it down, having a single bat from Night Witch stop the hog or whatever the counter push is in the opposite lane, and just creating a steam roll. Yes, I am mid ladder at 10,250 trophies. No, I don't care to try and actually win. The pure joy that fills me when I win with Golem first play is greater than actually be going good at the game. Knowing how mad some people get, it makes me smile. And, you would be shocked at how well this works. Sometimes you lose instantly, especially if the person is smart.

And as soon as something goes wrong it is everyone else's fault in the game, especially support and jungle. Holy shit why do grown adults have such a fetish to act like children. One example, had a game I'm solo carrying, quadra killing on gwen jungle and my solo laners are typing to report me when they engage on a fight for nothing and die.

I'm not saying they should disable shared facilities for everyone but c'mon. i want to find things on my own. discover the \"good stuff\" by myself. i really don't like finding chests because i went to eliminate a shared beacon. for me it feels like cheating. there is no cheating if the devs made the mechanic, but this is not how i want to play. I'm not opting out of this game because i really like it and I'm having so much fun but this particular thing is SOOO, SOOOO annoying submitted by /u/im_a_latam_weeb to r/Endfield [link] [comments]",

In this video, I am showing what could happen to stunned enemies in my game and how they can be displaced. I have set a high number for the stun value just to showcase this mechanic, which doesn't really give a chance to the enemies to respond (they have fully implemented behaviours and can attack, idle or patrol and transition smoothly between all these states and also both enemies have different attacks) but this will be an example for another time. Curious to see what you think about this and if you like it or not, this is very early in development so anything is subject to change. Thanks and curious to see what you think! submitted by /u/double_dmg_bonks [link] [comments]",

I don't disagree the players will find ways around this, but sometimes players can get attached to a style of play and you can rip it away from them in the difficulties, reducing their enjoyment and the quantity of useful/fun strategies. It's one of my biggest bugbears in gaming, and I've spent quite a lot of time working on my own game's difficulty. Trying to make sure cards and styles aren't removed (as much as possible) by difficulty tiers. For example, I don't have any difficulty settings that increase enemy stats, it would change the breakpoints at which the player's cards are useful. I just wanted to ask anybody else if they've found the same, and what methods they're using to prevent it from becoming an issue in their game? submitted by /u/Silvenx [link] [comments]",

I've played for at least an hour per day for the duration of this event and I still have all of the killer skins and five survivor skins to unlock, and I really don't think I'm going to be able to complete it because I simply can't afford to be on the game constantly. It really wouldn't have been that big of a deal if it was easier to grind gingerbread, but they both reduced the amount of gingerbread you get by removing the survivor win bonus and more than doubling the amount of skins you needed to buy (41 compared to the masquerade's 20.). Ignoring Nosferatu's cost since he was added to the shop after the event: Masquerade: 20 skins = 3,660 sukkars \"Coolest\" Christmas: 41 skins (21 event, 20 shop) = 5,910 gingerbread If I recall, didn't one of the higher ups mention how they're not big on the concept of fomo? If I am remembering correctly, it's pretty rich to say that and then turn around and pull this bs. And the real kick in the nuts is that it's such an easy fix, there's many different ways they could have done it: Add back the survivor win bonus Convert literally any of the masquerade's sukkars to at least some of the new gingerbread currency. Make the shop skins cost less gingerbread, or just make them cost player points instead (that's how it was last year, why does it have to be different now?). As it stands, I'm majorly disappointed with the event, it was already lazy enough to reuse the masquerade but the insane grind created by this one has made me burnt out of this event format, and I sincerely hope they do something different for any future events. submitted by /u/Altforislandstrading to r/FORSAKENROBLOX [link] [comments]",

Apparently it's already kind of hard to find players at C/D rank so that has me worried a bit. I'm assuming GBVSR probably won't go 6-7 years since if we count the original game it would be 12-13 years at that point, so maybe GBVSR has another year or two left?

My first instinct was to question what they wanted to trade but I just thought…who even cares at this point. So I sent it no questions asked. She added me. I accepted her. And she sent me Butter Beer FREE of charge to close my set! And I got the 700 dice (or however many it was) which allowed me to go for more flags which I desperately need to get this wild in the race. My team is tied for first right now but it’s looking good fingers crossed since I have 3,000 flags that can hopefully push us. Hoping my team has some too. And this happened after I just got 4k dice from a chocolate frog yesterday 😩 As horrible as scopely has been treating us I’ve been getting a lot of luck in this game recently so I just want to spread the love back out!

      "content": "When I got my NES 20 years ago when I was in high school, one of the games I specifically picked out was Wrecking Crew. I didn't really think it was amazing, just kind of playable and interesting But when I was watching triplejumps every mario game ranked, they ranked wrecking crew relatively low and even made a joke about how it would be a terrible way to spend your last week alive or something. Is it really awful though? I could see the point that it isn't particularly good, it's just not bad either. It at least deserves points for originality, especially coming off the precrash consoles where everything was a spaceship shooter or paddle game It's kind of an interesting proof that Nintendo always tried to innovate and come up with something original, but it's also kind of a proof that original doesn't always mean good. But not bad either. Of course it would have been better if the US (and Europe if it was even released there at all) got the tape drive or some other way to save levels, but I really don't think that would have saved (no pun intended) it. Excitebike and Penguin Land (on the Sega Master System) let you create levels and no one cares. I don't think no one cares just becuase you can't save, I think it is the fact that you don't have the ability to make anything really fleshed out like when making a ZZT map or Doom wad, or even a Super Mario Maker level submitted by /u/bigdonut100 to r/nes [link] [comments]",

You probably don’t think it’s a big deal when you send me a screenshot of the thing you just bought or compliment my fitness progress nth times but to me those are anchors. You’re giving me emotional landmarks in a day that would otherwise blur together. You don’t love bomb. You don’t future-fake. You don’t manipulate me with big words. Instead, you show up. Quietly. Steadily. In your own time. And God—you didn't know how much I missed that version of you until you came back. The version of you I first met. The one who made me laugh, kept me curious, made me feel safe without ever saying the words out loud. I used to think connection had to be loud to be real. I used to fall for men who were fluent in poetry but bankrupt in presence. You’re different. You don’t play the game and yet somehow you still win my day. Even when you’re far away. Even when it’s just laundry updates, work rants and gym wins. Even when you disappear for a bit and I doubt everything — you still come back with that quiet spark in your messages like, “What? You missed me?” Yeah. I did. So just in case no one’s told you lately: You’re appreciated. And somewhere out here, there’s a girl smiling to herself at 5 a.m. Because you remembered to say good morning. (And also because you woke her up with your text...)

      "content": "Hi there, so, I am going to terribly describe what I think I have a phobia of, or at least something that actually makes me panic quite a bit. I don't know if there's some phobia that overlaps with Thalassophobia: ( the persistent and intense fear of deep bodies of water, such as the ocean, seas, or lakes ) and Nyctophobia ( Fear of the Dark/Unseen ) but I'll describe situations where it does and doesn't trigger. Doesn't Trigger: A dark room? I mean when I'm going to bed, that's fine, lights off, crawl into bed, not a hint of concern. Pools? Most at least, once the water gets to a point of distance where I can't actually see the other side underwater, then that's an issue but that's like..in murky as heck water. Does trigger: (Sorry but I've only had it actually trigger in situations in games.) Underwater levels where I cannot see the whole space. If like..the render distance is closer to me and I cannot see from one side of the area to the other, I will start to freak out a bit. A pitch black location where everything had suddenly disappeared. You ever play a horror game where you walk into a pitch black room, you turn around and then the door's gone, and then there's just nothing? So, it's not a fear of water specifically, I love swimming, and not a fear of normal darkness, but some extreme of both where I cannot see my entire space. Like, a phobia of lacking awareness of my surroundings? submitted by /u/Strange_Ad_2032 to r/Phobia [link] [comments]",

      "content": "I've been looking into getting the mini flip for an EDC device and was wondering if I could realistically play a game like Metroid: Zero Mission on it somewhat comfortably. The \"comfortability\" of a device isn't really just the overall size; The weight and buttons (especially the triggers in a game like Zero Mission) play a big part in it too. If we're getting nitpicky I've found the buttons on my brick are noticeably harder to press down than on other devices I've used, so I ended up finishing Zero Mission on my DSi instead. The extra pressure I needed to use on the brick made my hands cramp up sometimes playing it, with the only saving grace being that it would have been even worse if it wasn't as hefty as it is. I also own the regular miyoo mini v4, and while the face buttons are easy to press, the triggers were a nightmare when trying Zero Mission, and I also felt like I had to \"baby\" the device to not damage the screen. The clamshell design of the mini flip would solve this problem, with the bonus of having triggers that are actually flat rather than slanted. Even though I have medium-sized hands, I never really found small devices like these as uncomfortable as most people seem to say. Maybe it's just how I like to hold them compared to others but it's something to note. So all of that nitpicking is just to say that if the miyoo mini flip is lightweight AND has easy-to-press buttons then that might make it pass the Zero Mission test in my book. I wanted some other opinions on if I'm just delusional or not! submitted by /u/zase7 to r/SBCGaming [link] [comments]",

However, over time I found inner calmness and didn't had this anymore for many years. I feel way better than 10 months ago but there are still spikes of so much anger. The way she abused me emotionally, utilized me, cheated on me and finally insulted me massively after she cheated. But I still have these spikes of massive anger because all of that. I just wanted to have a future with her. Love her. She was in the process of moving houses. I bought a gift for her, planned how I could get her flowers without her noticing it so I can hand them to her in her new flat. And she decides to fuck a random guy she met a day prior. Anyways..these spikes of anger lead me to destroy stuff in my flat. I know in the seconds before I do this that I shouldn't. And I still do it. I feel like I have to canalize this energy somewhere. I don't want to do this anymore. Its enough. I do lots of sports and this helps me massively. But sometimes the thoughts come up. She didn't take a single drop of responsibility, gave me no closure, no talk. Just massive insults. submitted by /u/Throwaway-Dust-831 to r/survivinginfidelity [link] [comments]",

      "content": "New dads don't need more \"cute stuff\" or generic gift baskets—they need gear that actually saves time at 2am feedings and makes those first chaotic months more manageable. Full list: Practical Gifts That Make the First Months Easier This list skips the fluff and focuses on practical wins that matter: handling diaper changes anywhere without drama, establishing better sleep routines, and small comfort upgrades that actually get used every single day instead of collecting dust. One standout from the roundup: a formula dispenser that makes a warm, perfectly measured bottle in literal seconds, no scooping, no measuring, no mixing at 3am while half asleep. It's the kind of gift that pays off immediately when you're running on zero sleep and just need something to work right the first time. The guide also covers other essentials like portable diaper stations, quality baby carriers that don't wreck your back, white noise machines that actually help babies sleep, and dad-specific gear that makes the learning curve less steep. What was your most-used piece of gear as a new parent, the thing you genuinely couldn't have survived without? submitted by /u/Important-Road-3493 to r/readingspace [link] [comments]",

You spend dried fish as a resource to summon different cats onto the lane and try to crack the enemy base. Each unit has its own role/skill, so it’s more about timing and cost management than pure spam. The two vampire gifs are from a later boss fight where the boss moves with the wave, throws out big attacks and can easily wipe your frontline if you mistime your summons. The last gif is a little interaction I like: a tiny knight cat jumps onto a big tank cat and rides along while attacking, so they move as one unit.

Luke's boat was supposed to be packed with all sorts of monsters. And Argus, was not mention or seen. The hippocampi were only shown super far away, just their top halves, and no one even rode them. Heck, the Mist is barely a thing, and the Golden Fleece didn't even turn into a Letterman jacket like in the book. The only thing I can say the movies did right was actually making the fantasy elements feel real. If the show was animated, all those live-action problems wouldn't exist, and it would've been so much easier to see all the fantastical settings. submitted by /u/huslug to r/PJODisney [link] [comments]",

I know per USA Hockey rules, anything after 12 and the coach misses the next game. How is that reported/enforced? Is it up to us to reach out to our local USA Hockey affiliate or will the ref make a report to them?

I was truly surprised at how packed the game was looked basically sold out. After the game the media was interviewing fans outside and it was crazy how so many braved the weather just to see Luka! It still dumbfounds me how ignorant Nico Harrison was for trading Luka. Not wanting to give a max contract to a player that easily deserved it. I can only imagine the amount of money lost from Luka merchandise and especially ticket sales making a max contract seem trivial in regard. Watching who you thought was going to be your franchise player on another team and seeing your team go from finals contenders to not even playoff ready. Sorry for the rant, just hard to be a Mavs fan. 😫 submitted by /u/Kamehameha069 to r/nba [link] [comments]",

I'm using a lower resolution here because my monitors resolution is so high the compression in the video would just hide the dithering. Was learning about different dithering algorithms and ways to handle transparency in a more performant way, but this turned out looking pretty cool. I think Unreal Engine has this default distance fade thing (idk it's a long time since I used Unreal), and it looks pretty cool. If anyone is knowledgeable on where I could find how Unreal handles that please let me know! I'm also interested in if there's any other middle ground between blending transparency and alpha scissor other than dithering that I could implement. submitted by /u/binbun3 [link] [comments]",

Geno Smith needs to protect the ball, while DK Metcalf and Tyler Lockett provide serious downfield threat. Defensively, Seattle’s pressure up front could be crucial. If you’re trying to work out where to watch Rams vs Seahawks live stream today without cable or local TV coverage, it can get confusing. Many fans mention Ant Sports for watching NFL games live. How are you watching this one? submitted by /u/VLucifer55 to r/jind [link] [comments]",

From Dark Souls, the combat foundation - but with my own twists and ideas. I’m developing all of this completely solo in Unreal Engine 5. Over 3000 hours of work, no team, and almost no budget. A year and a half ago, I was just an IT employee, but I made a sharp career change, started learning programming from scratch, and fully dove into game development.

I don't understand why this has to be so hard, Mithril. I get you don't want any \"F.U.D./unrest\" spreading, but the silience is much more damaging; people are go through the 5 stages of grief; having hopium, frustration, anger, utnil they finally just accept it and leave forever. as things die down and get worse for pc players, i’d strongly advise becoming more transparent. whether the news is good or bad, people need to be kept informed so they know what to expect. hiding behind the whole fud philosophy just makes things worse and will make people hate you.

Even others famous fighting games are using LP+MK to grab: Granblue Fantasy Versus: Rising, Melty Blood, Under Night In-Birth, Skullgirls etc... So why not using the same grab shortcut for 2XKO?

Which brings me to my point, I'd like to get into a new program that would : -Give me usefull skills for a game dev career but also -Open up a career path outside of the games industry in the worst case scenario For now I've been looking at project management, more publicity stuff, administration etc. So what do you think ?

MORE RUN HISTORY (put a number the runs so it’s easier to keep track of when scrolling too) Allow me to shatter more modules at once!?!??! Why can I only shatter 12 mods at once?!?!? Show mods, range and shockwave size used in round stats since they can’t be changed anyways so there’s nothing complicated to keep track of. Allow me to change the coins per minute to a rolling average of the last 5 minutes or last 10 etc. Or add a graph to battle history/stats showing CPH over time. Make spotlight more visible. It’s hard to see with all the other stuff on screen! More card presets. I know some of you will hate me for giving Fudds ideas but to me this is like the perfect thing he could charge 5 bucks for. If you’re cheap you don’t need it and if you’re like me then fine, if it costs 5$ to have like 5 more card presets then just do it. Module presets like we have card presets so I don’t have to click 10 times to adjust for tournaments. Lab presets for range and shockwave for the same reason. Have banners where one module is like 500 gems but you can get max 1 or 2 from the banner. Stops people from getting too many but evens the playing field somewhat.

Originally, maps consisted of a start and end tile, with 3 rows of 5 tiles in between. All of the connections between tiles were also hard-coded. Now, paths can be randomized without any hard-coding (with the exception of the start/end tiles since both of those should always connect to the start/end of the paths between them).

      "content": "I was thinking playing today on Lethal with my friends. I wish this game would just promote more coop mechanics. Like I wish we could stagger enemies off when they are attacking our friends, instead enemies get stagger immunity after few hits. And if your friend is in trouble, you can't really do much to get them off, except try to do supreme damage. Also it would be cool if you could see all the red attack warnings that your friends are seeing. Because that is how the game is played, you see red attack you dodge. But when you try to help your friend, you don't see them. And you might get hit. (Yes I am sure most people who read this are masters who can tell what is red attack in their sleep 😄). Also if someone manages to parry the attack, attack shouldn't hit some other character to the face after that. There are a lot of reasons why trying to help your teammates is kinda super risky. So I usually just shoot enemies with my pistol instead. But it would be cooler if we could really rush some enemies together better. And how about sticking close to your team makes temporary health go down BIT slower? That would imo be great too. Also the stims, they seem to always be a problem, who takes them, why some refuse to take them and why doesn't someone know of Mortal Wounds? It's easy to fix (but probably not easy to program haha), just let us stim teammates. And sometimes we could show them: \"Hey, this is how you can fix Mortal Wound.\" This game could have more stuff like this, right now it kind of encourages to not stick together so much and instead you should stick to your own portion of the level. submitted by /u/SuperArppis to r/Spacemarine [link] [comments]",

It can also be composed, sequenced, or otherwise produced to be indirectly played mechanically or electronically, such as via a music box, barrel organ, or digital audio workstation software on a computer. Music often plays a key role in social events and religious ceremonies. The techniques of making music are often transmitted as part of a cultural tradition. Music is played in public and private contexts, highlighted at events such as festivals and concerts for various different types of ensembles. Music is used in the production of other media, such as in soundtracks to films, TV shows, operas, and video games. submitted by /u/Flaviphone to r/balkans_irl [link] [comments]",

If it goes all the way down, you can slow down and it will be harder to focus on catching ghosts! If you like, I would appreciate if you can check it out and share any feedback as it helps a ton!

Is there some third way I dont know of? For clarification: it will maybe have different sizes, but it will definitely stay in an overseeable size, so I‘d guess I don’t need an actual tilemap.

It doesn't matter who you are or what you identify as, your orientation -- there's no shame, I think everybody's valid! :D I have a pretty corny sense of humor and can be banterous at times, but also I'm down to just generally chat at times like good friends should! :D If ya need to vent about anything or if you need a pet pic to brighten your day (I have 2 doggos), I'll gladly help out with that! In terms of the video games I play, I primarily like Nintendo things; (if you like Mario, Pokémon, Super Smash Bros., Rhythm Heaven, etc. we'll likely get a long well!). Some non-Nintendo franchises I like include Pac-Man, Mega Man, and Minecraft! I'm also getting into Sonic quite a bit! I also REALLY love playing retro games from the NES era all the way up to DS/Wii era -- and gosh it's crazy that those are considered retro now o_o Aside from just playing games, I also am a content creator and make YouTube gaming videos at times! I also program/code, primarily software and web development stuff, with a bit of game projects on the side as a hobby. I also am into art.. but only a bit! :P I like doing pixel art and drawing from time to time (I'm not really that good LOL), but if you're an artist I'd love to see your work! I love seeing peoples creativity, their OCs, -- even if you're a furry, I love seeing everybodys characters & all that! I also am an amateur voice actor (I just do impressions and such for fangames, nothing major yet!) Lastly, I watch a lot of YouTube videos and also like cartoons a lot! I'm not really into anime that much, but maybe yall could get me into watching it! Who knows?

      "content": "I was at the game today and something really stuck with me in a bad way. Midway through the second period they showed some fans on the video board who had anti-ICE signs. A big chunk of the crowd started chanting “No more ICE.” Instead of letting that moment exist, GSA immediately made a Code of Conduct announcement over the PA to shut it down. On top of that, last week at a few games I saw security taking anti-ICE signs at the gates and I personally know people who were turned away for wearing anti-ICE shirts. That feels really gross given how much this organization talks about inclusivity, diversity, and standing with the community. This is not some abstract political issue. People in Minnesota are angry and scared because of what ICE has been doing here and because people have literally been killed. Fans reacting to that in a public space is not random or disruptive, it is a reflection of what the community is dealing with right now. I get that teams want to avoid “politics” at games, but choosing to silence one side is not neutral. It is a choice, and it sends a message about which voices are acceptable and which are not. I love this team and I want to be proud of the organization too, but today felt like a big miss. Curious if anyone else at the game noticed this or had the same reaction. submitted by /u/AdrianDitmann to r/TwinCities [link] [comments]",

I've set the game to 1080p, no v sync, 1080p with v sync, everything as low as possible. Ive done game file checks. Even turned down my monitors refresh rate to 60hz. Seems things I've read online is the games code for msaa is bugged. And disabling it helps but you can only do that with a nexus mod that's been deleted. My fps isn't bad it's just laggy and I get so much light flickering. I've even reinstalled my driver's. What's weird is i never had this issue when I had a 1660 or a 3060 My monitor is a 4k 240hz monitor. Ive moved it over to the 1440p one thats at 165hz.

Which means that I get all the new updates for free and all the new job packs. But in the perspective of someone that just recently bought it there is no way I’m paying for all the job packs just to actually have like a decent amount of fun on the game. And now they’re adding a bunch of new stuff like the Hollywood thing the same thing the vampire stuff it’s so annoying for how money hunger they are. I get apps like this actually cost money to develop at this point. They’re literally just scamming us and now we have to pay an absurd amount of money to actually enjoy the game. You even have to pay extra money to play other casino games other than blackjack like I feel like that should just be something that could be in the base and if you don’t buy bitizenship s you get bombarded with ads like every five seconds the idea of the game is absolutely fun but the execution of it and the obvious greed from the owners just completely destroys the game itself. If this game is gonna get any better, they have to give us updates that we actually ask for and not make it so every new DLC costs a fortune. submitted by /u/Worried_Oven4837 to r/BitLifeApp [link] [comments]",

People have been my best friends but I’ve never been theirs. All through elementary school and middle school and high school I tried to make friends. I was a little weird but i remember making conscious decisions to not make weird choices or say anything the normal kids wouldn’t like. And although I wasn’t bullied, people didn’t want to hang out with ne either. Around high school it got better but I realized I was part of a « group » but always the last to be thought of, and never made a priority. A few things i remember in particular- it was not birthday and my parents allowed me to invite some friends to the movies. Nobody came, they all had excuses and my parents had my older sister and her friend take me instead. I was so embarrassed. Another time i was meeting some people at a football game and I didn’t know where they were sitting. I asked a girl for the group if she could never ne at the entrance and walk with me to the group and she didn’t want to. Nobody in the group did. I remember when I found then and they made plans without me I was left wondering if this would be my entire life. my older sister always had so many friends and I wanted to be like her so badly. She’s still friends with a lot of people from college and High school today. I want that so badly. I want a group chat. I want girls nights. I want someone I can cry to and whine to that isn’t my husband. I joined a sorority (yes you can do that as an adult lol) and I’m hoping to make some friends and genuine connections. I’m trying my best to out myself out there and make the effort but Idk, I guess part of me is asking what the masses think. How can I make REAL friendships at my age? Bumble was a bust for sure.

      "title": "(Update) Implementing a new Flow Field Algorithm",
      "content": "A while ago, I posted about my work on a new flow field algorithm for navigation. I'm here with a progress update, and a bit of a practical demonstration as well. Alright, so, here's the gist of it: the algorithm works for the most part . I haven't been able to fix every single edge case that pops up, but the good news is that errors no longer seem to propagate more errors as the algorithm spreads out. Therefore, I see the algorithm as in a usable state. I believe there are improvements that could be made, but—for now—I'll work towards documenting and polishing my current solution so that you all can use it for your own games. In the mean time, here's a bit of a practical demonstration of the difference between a regular flow field and my \"fungi\" flow field (the name was inspired by experiments with slime mold exploring mazes). I'm working on a game where you play as a speedboat running from torpedoes, which you can see in the second part of the video. The green lines coming from the \"torpedoes\" indicate the direction that the navigation field is pointing the torpedoes towards (the pink lines are from the avoidance field, so you can ignore them). With the standard flow field, you can see that the targets are only in 8 directions ( up, down, left, right, and diagonals ). This works, but it creates rigid movements and sub-optimal paths. With the fungi flow field, you can see how it's pointing them in all directions. This creates smoother movements and better paths for the torpedoes, all within the same time complexity as a standard flow field. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. submitted by /u/Nondescript_Potato [link] [comments]",

Manufacture was worse: I never found the last code and had no idea where to get it. Here’s the thing: after watching the playthrough, I realised I probably never would’ve beaten the duo bosses anyway.

My search for one led me to this dev's previous game . But, the visual style of his previous work made it hard for me to get into it. It was an interesting design choice, but not to my liking. But, the sequel seems a lot more easier on the eyes. Which is why it's been on my wishlist for a while. I could be wrong, but this is a solo-dev project.

      "content": "If I was even pettier I would track and make a chart showing how long each character from all 4 seasons stays silent on average and bet your ass Aabria would come in last. Every single thing other players do, she comments on. She doesn’t just meta comments, she makes her character scream a comment at the other end of the room for a scene that she is not part of. Every beautiful description by Brennan ends with her one liners. She constantly makes small talk with Occtis that does not carry the story forward. Every single dice roll whether high or low warrants an audible reaction by her. EVERY SINGLE ROLL. You don’t have to say ‘Allright!’ ‘Thats good! Thats good right?’ to every 19 rolled…….. I am extremely disappointed on how the Seekers table turned out especially after the treat that was the Soldiers. I think I will skip the Seekers and just recap to catch up because I simply can’t stand it. And I believe except for her every single person on every table understands this concept. This is not just a home game people play for their own enjoyment and just happens to be streamed. This is a quality production. People are not there to be charmed by any single character, they are there to watch a story unfold. When meaningless rambling overshadows the story I believe there is a problem. One of Jester’s core quirks as a character was rambling and talking a lot but Laura could stay silent when others were having a scene. Let me say this I have no problem with her as a person. When it is a collaborative scene where everyone gets the spotlight it really works well. She is a good player. Its just she NEVER shuts up.

      "title": "[PC][Late 90s] Weird clip art style PC rpg",
      "content": "Hey, ya'll. Trying to remember this weird RPG from my childhood. This one's a bit vague, so I don't expect much, but I remember playing it on probably windows 95 or 98. The game was kinda an RPG but it was a little open ended, a bit weird, but the striking thing I remember about is that literally almost all the assets were flat. Like clip art. I'm talking everything. The monsters. The world map. Items. Equipment. Everything. Some of it was cartoony, but some of it was realistic clip art images. Kinda an absolute mess of Art assets, none of it was cohesive in any way, so it's not like it had a unified style. One minute you'd be fighting cartoon bunnies, the next you're fighting clip art of a real looking dresser. I don't think it was an RPG Maker game. Probably is from before the time of RPGmaker I probably got it off some weird shareware website like Happy puppy or something. for what it's worth, when I googled it some people came up with RM color magic on this sub years ago, and that's not it. submitted by /u/EXSource to r/tipofmyjoystick [link] [comments]",

I was officially assigned to the Chamber of Commerce last year, which makes it all feel slightly more legitimate, despite the fur, the socks, and the lack of a proper desk. Rome wasn’t built in a day, and neither is an indie game studio. One day this “office” will be legendary. Probably still with cats. submitted by /u/collins112 [link] [comments]",

The new versions ( A, B, and D ) all show an execution scene with four differently colored players, to make it clearer that this is a co-op multiplayer game with player decision-making.

      "title": "Contact/Interference in Squash is becoming similar to Football, is this really a bad thing?",
      "content": "We all see the rise in deliberate contacts in recent times, and it resembles football so much. In football, defenders are taught to use the most contact possible without giving away a foul. In the example, Van Dijk pushes Haaland mid-strike to ruin his balance to lower the shot quality. This will never ever be given as a foul because Haaland got his shot away. Sound familiar? I think right now, players like Asal and Zakaria are ahead of the curve, and as such we have reached a tipping point in squash. The way I see it, squash must make a decision: 1) Go back to giving 'soft' lets. If effort was made to play but there was clear contact, just give a let. Continue to punish a lack of effort with no lets though. 2) Embrace contact. Truly view contact as a part of the game. This truly evens the playing field and allows for some consistency. What we cannot due to is have the current scenario where someone like Bryant is consistently giving his opponent's daylight to play the ball, and Asal who is lazily walking into people to knock them off balance every time he drives the ball. However, if Asal's lazy contacts (which made Zakaria furious) are still never being punished, then in 4 years everyone will be doing it. I still can't think of how we punish it. Conduct strokes for minor contacts are unrealistic, you will have fans moaning that the refs are inserting themselves in the match too much. And how often do you give them? Every 5 nudges in 3 minutes? It doesn't work. Post match reviews and bans would surely lead to bias, and frankly I don't think PSA has the resources. Etc. There is no real way to penalise these Asal nudges, so why not embrace it? Is it really so bad if we have players trying to bump each other every shot? Would squash not just adapt? If you have to worry about being bumped then the demand for high accuracy goes up, leaving loose shots is punished so severely that I'd argue shot quality would actually increase. With the importance of shot quality going up, perhaps the sport itself would produce better racket skills and also fewer decisions. Which way should squash go? submitted by /u/Explosive_Spreader20 to r/squash [link] [comments]",

My current performance in newer titles at 1440p is starting to struggle, specifically with VRAM limitations and some stuttering. I have about $800 USD to spend on upgrades. My Current Specs: CPU: Intel Core i5-12400F (6 Cores / 12 Threads) GPU: ZOTAC RTX 4060 Twin Edge OC (8GB) Motherboard: Asrock B760M PG Lightning (DDR5) RAM: 16GB (2 x 8GB) Patriot SL Sig DDR5 5600MHz Storage: 1TB Lexar NM790 Gen4 SSD PSU: 650W FSP Hv Pro 80+ Bronze My Questions: With $800 as budget , should I put most of it into a new GPU (like an RTX 5070 or 4070 Ti Super)? Will my 650W PSU be enough for a significant GPU upgrade, or do I need to replace that too? Is it worth upgrading to 32GB of RAM now, or should I stick with 16GB and focus the money elsewhere?

First method: scoreboard players set @p[nbt={SelectedItem:{id:\"minecraft:wither_skeleton_skull\"}}] DIRECTION 1 scoreboard players set @p[nbt={SelectedItem:{id:\"minecraft:zombie_head\"}}] DIRECTION 2 scoreboard players set @p[nbt={SelectedItem:{id:\"minecraft:player_head\"}}] DIRECTION 3 scoreboard players set @p[nbt={SelectedItem:{id:\"minecraft:creeper_head\"}}] DIRECTION 4 scoreboard players set @p[nbt={SelectedItem:{id:\"minecraft:soul_sand\"}}] DIRECTION 5 [Then my code for key press conditions, selected slot.] Advantages: Effective, responds well. Sharp image unlike method 2. Disadvantages: There's a brake key to stop continuous movement. Need to reconfigure the \"1 2 3 4 5\" inventory slot keys to \"up, down, left, right\", plus \"M\" for example for the brake. Second method: execute at @p if entity [name=DOWN,distance=..0.999] run scoreboard players set @p DIRECTION 1 execute at @p if entity [name=UP,distance=..0.999] run scoreboard players set @p DIRECTION 2 execute at @p if entity [name=LEFT,distance=..0.999] run scoreboard players set @p DIRECTION 3 execute at @p if entity [name=RIGHT,distance=..0.999] run scoreboard players set @p DIRECTION 4 tp @p[scores={DIRECTION=1..4}] 518 86 482.0 -90 0 [Then my code for key press conditions.] scoreboard players set @p DIRECTION 0 Advantages: Effective, responds well. Movement only when key is pressed or held. No more brake key. Nothing to configure on the player's side. Disadvantages: Screen shaking due to slight perceived movements and teleports FOV or zoom out in case of double press because sprint is triggered. My questions: How can I remove the shaking as much as possible and the sprint FOV for method 2? How can I make method 1 automatically switch slots? Something like that. To no longer have a brake key, and the action only occurs when the slot key is pressed. Which is the best method in your opinion?

      "content": "I'm playing it for a few days already. And my feeling is that game simply don't give you much resources for gacha. I got only 25k oroberyl + 66 origeometry. That's not even close to guarantee pull. I'm collecting chests, completing side missions, do all stuff on the map etc. Then I decided to check on how many origeometry I need to buy to get guarantee. It's 800. And maximum amount you can buy is 194. I means you need to buy it four times (three if you include x2 for the first time). It's $280 ($210 if we include first x2). That's insane. I played HSR for long time and I could tell even here devs are much more generous when it comes to free stuff. And if you played those games you know how greedy mihoyo are. Yes, weapons are much easier to get compared to Genshin/HSR. But when game gives you almost zero resources to spin gacha - that's not gonna change much. I want to love this game just like I love original Arknights. But if devs won't change revards or price of one spin I don't think I stay in this game for long time. submitted by /u/dasistgoose to r/Endfield [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Hi everyone, I could really use some outside perspective 🥲 I’m 17F and I have a crush on my classmate (17M). We’re both seniors, and the school year ends around March. I’ve liked him since around September 2025, but we only really got closer recently. On January 24, 2026, we were assigned a project together, and that’s when we actually started spending time one-on-one. That day, we went out to buy supplies for the project, talked the entire car ride, and got to know each other more. We even found out our birthdays are only two days apart — his is February 14 and mine is February 16, same year (2008), which I thought was kind of cute and oddly romantic 😭 We worked on the project at his house, and later that evening, he drove me home safely. What’s making me overthink is that we’re neighbors — I could’ve easily just walked home from his place, but he still insisted on driving me. I also met his little brother that day, which felt kind of… significant? Or maybe I’m just romanticizing everything. I want to deepen this connection, but the thing is, we’re not going to the same college after senior year. I don’t know if that makes things harder or if I should still try. So I guess my questions are: Does this sound like he might be interested, or am I just assuming? How can I naturally deepen our connection without making things awkward? Any advice or reality checks would really help. Thank you 💛 submitted by /u/PuzzleheadedShine891 to r/Advice [link] [comments]",

The spear is on the projectile itself, not the explosion, which sort of makes sense where it's like 4000 damage and ap7. The solo silo however is on the explosion so that's what we'll compare to the C4, and if you've seen both of these explosions they are not the same. And from a balance pov the solo is a one shot where as thw C4 has seven. The C4 is way more comparable to something like the RR. Now the elephant in the room is dynamite. I'm gonna be honest this was given a demo of 40 cause they desperately wanted people to pick something other than gas and therm. This was kinda the only unque thing they could give it without cranking the damage to 2250. It was already a good grenade, it just wasn't the therm. I don't think they would have an explosion of this yield do 40 demo if they didn't need to force diversity in the grenade slot. submitted by /u/MiddleConcentrate197 to r/Helldivers [link] [comments]",

      "content": "I just commented this on a post asking why we don’t play anymore. I stated that I find myself in FreePlay most of the time now bc it’s just not as fun anymore to play rounds. Even in masters servers. I truly believe the 2x star weekends had a big part in the decrease in creative and quality fits in masters servers, but ofc farming in general exists as well. When the masters servers first opened I thought it was kind wild to have the star requirement start at trendsetter being that you need to be fashion maven (3,000⭐️) to enter pro servers, but only an additional two rank to get into masters servers. Yeah it’s (8,000⭐️) more and I’m not saying it’s not a lot but with how long the game and new ranks have been out I believe it’s time to change the requirements. Adding another server for higher ranks will be too much imo. And won’t fix the issue, bc eventually the same thing will happen. I think the requirement for PRO servers should be trendsetter. At the very least runway queen (it’ll be more special seeing the rank change from having no color to color here too). & for Masters… Fashion Mogul. No less than that. Ranking up from FMogul - FG is extremely hard. So I think it’s fitting. It would dramatically change the servers, I believe, for the better. More people who play in private would come back to public and the votes would be better as well. Just like they were when these ranks and this server was first introduced. Now I’m not saying every higher rank dresses well bc they DO NOT. and they are some Runway Divas who could washhhhh Fashion goddesses. But for the most part, it would def make playing rounds more enjoyable. And ranking up more Satisfying ✨ Sorry for the rant and yapping. Also this is just my opinion.

As an example, KVA cited targeted advertising in vertical video format that they discovered, in which Dutch YouTube blogger Kelvin Burma (Kalvijn, 1.37 million YouTube subscribers) allegedly advertises the Ice Cold Fish gambling app, which uses the branding of the Ice Fishing live game (Evolution) and leads to an unnamed operator. According to the organization, the ad was launched without the blogger's knowledge. 💬 KVA also urges influencers to monitor the use of their image themselves and report violations to the regulator. submitted by /u/harryneyt1 to r/GamblingMediaNews [link] [comments]",

      "content": "I’ve just released the public demo for my indie game Medieval Decklords on Steam. It’s a medieval-themed strategy card game where the core gameplay is based on 3-card poker . Each match is played across three lanes (left, center, right). Over four turns, you build 3-card hands in each lane, manage a fixed 40-card deck, and try to outplay your opponent through probability, timing, and commitment. The demo lets you play full matches and experience the core mechanics, progression, and pacing of the game. If medieval strategy games and poker-style decision making sound interesting to you, you can try the demo here: https://store.steampowered.com/app/4274210/Medieval_Decklords/ submitted by /u/zwelingo [link] [comments]",

While this isn't usually an issue in normal adventures, it makes her even more RNG dependant on adventures with the \"Lethal\" modifier, where being able to strike units is crucial to stay alive. Turning her 5th star into an upgrade of her 2nd by adding the effect of buffing dragons in the deck would make it easier for her to survive in harder adventures, while making it so that it buffs dragons everywhere would make Dragon's Rage work with her and make Egghead Researcher a functional card in the deck. While there are other ways to significantly improve the champion's performance (mostly changes to her base deck), this would be easiest one to implement, specially considering how underwhelming she is at 5 stars. And since I'm making a Shyvana post, could Ruined Dragonguard's interaction with her 2nd star be fixed? It wouldn't change his status as the worst card in the deck, but at least it would make him playable submitted by /u/4002sacuL to r/LegendsOfRuneterra [link] [comments]",

They accepted a free pet, tried to argue the ban, then supposedly was permabanned from the subreddit, as the player who gave the pet was supposedly banned for 1 day. Checked the subreddit rules fir myself, and was surpised. So, while theres constant posts about Vouches for Venom/NM that arent being removed, it seems we can no longer even give away trash pets without facing penalty. I was very disappointed to see this in the subreddit rules. At this point, almost everyone knows that someone can fake a hacking story to beg for pets. I think begging shouldn't be allowed, that I agree with. But not being able to willingly give away pets to help players complete the events? The devs are making the game suck, please dont let the subreddit contribute towards that too. I, and many others get joy out of being able to help another player. If they're not really a noob, oh well, I feel it should be our own choice to part with that pet, just like how people are choosing to trust someone to give their OP pet back after Venom mutation - although I argue thats even worse, as scamming potential is much, much higher with these \"services\" than someone givlng away a Pink Bunny. Anyways, thats my rant. I miss the sense of community this game had. It just seems destined to die at this point. :/ submitted by /u/28e9293 to r/growagarden [link] [comments]",

      "content": "We got engaged last year. We started planning our wedding recently, and I decided to ask tarot for fun what our future would look like after marriage. No specific timeliness, just an over all vibe of our married life. Card Positions... Top: Overall energy - King of Cups First row: Mental connection - Queen of Swords Emotional connection - Ace of Swords Physical connection - Knight of Wands Bottom row: Finances/careers - The Chariot Home/Children - 10 of Cups Healing/Self-Growth - 8 of Pentacles Bottom of the deck: Queen of Cups My interpretation: I understand most of this, and it very much alignes with what I expected (I love when that happens lol) Our mental connection is so good and our communication is direct and clear. We quite literally read each others minds without knowing/trying(we have scorpio mercuries that are exact conjunct / our gemini moons as well), and we talk all the damn time. We never run out of conversation with one another. The queen of swords makes sense here given our current intellectual connection. The ace of swords for emotional connections is interesting... first I thought it meant we may intellectualize more than feel, but there is so much emotion all over the rest of this, that I think it may be saying we are always emotionally honest with one another. Idk.. feel free to leave opinions on this. Knight of Wands is well... I feel like this is self explanatory haha but if I have to give an interpretation, I'll try to keep it PG by saying I think it's pointing to our love of keeping things fresh, exciting, passionate, impulsive, and adventurous. The Chariot is another one I didn't immediately understand. I am thinking it means we will keep moving forward towards our goals, maybe? Idk...help on this one would be cool 10 of cups I feel is obvious as well. We want kids and i think this leans towards saying we will have them, but regardless, our home will be filled with love. Healing and self-growth also tracks to me. We are both really passionate about our healing journeys, growing and being accountable for ourselves. We have healed a lot in this connection. We have a lot of past traumas, coping mechanisms, and things we need to heal and work on, and I think this is saying it's something we will continue to put in the work to do. Also, I loved that the overall energy was the King of cups and the bottom of the deck complimented that with the queen 🥰 Overall, I felt this was a really positive omen for my future marriage. Curious if anyone sees something different or has more clarity on the Chariot or ace of swords. Thank you 🤍 submitted by /u/mindlessly-dreaming to r/Tarots [link] [comments]",

      "content": "I’m building a narrative, OSR-like system (d20 roll-over, with stat blocks from OSE being compatible). On their turn, a player can move, make a weapon attack, or take a maneuver, a maneuver being anything that actively tries to do damage to an enemy(make a poison, cut a chandelier rope, hurl a boulder). I want creative maneuvers to produce big, dramatic moments. Here’s the mechanic that's still very much a work in progress: • Player states intent; GM assigns an attribute. • The PC’s attribute modifier = number of dice (e.g. +4 = 4 dice). • The player rolls one d20 to determine the die type: • 1–5 = no effect • 6–10 = d4 • 11–15 = d6 • 16–19 = d8 • 20+ = d10 Example: crafting a poison uses INT. PC has +4 and rolls a 17 → poison deals 4d8 damage. So they get to roll 4d8 to see how much damage they do. • Targets get a save to take half damage (a natural 20 on the save = no damage). I like this because it creates a single cinematic moment where creativity is rewarded, and it would be the only time in my game players get to roll multiple dice at once. Buuuut it also feels like it most likely will completely break the game, making boss fights a walk in the park if you're creative and lucky. An alternative is to have the GM choose the die type and let the d20 determine the number of dice, but that pushes a lot of balancing onto the GM mid-combat.

      "content": "So I have been trying to diagnose a very rough idle on my 03 Impreza Outback for the last few weeks and can't seem to figure it out. The codes were giving IAC and MAF sensor issues. Both of these have been replaced as well as the Fuel Pressure Regulator and PCV. I also checked for vacuum leaks with no success. I ran it through an idle reset process which fixed the pulsating idle (have video of this) but it still runs very rough when cold. When it warms up it sounds better as well as when I pull the throttle (see video). When I go to put it in gear is when it really sounds bad, like the engine is about to kill (800 or less rpms). There is no forbidden milkshake in the oil or coolant. The engine has had a tick since I bought it (roughly 2 years ago). The exhaust was next on my list to replace and sounds terrible which doesn't help the diagnosis. My consensus is that the engine is toast but I don't want that to be it. I have photos of the spark plugs. They were covered in carbon but didn't seem too bad. I cleaned these up to see if that would help but it didn't change much. Do any of you guys know what the issue might be and if it is fixable without dumping a lot of money into it? Do I just cut my losses and junk it? I have photos of the codes and spark plugs as well as other videos of the idling issues that seem to have been resolved. Cheers and I appreciate the input here, I really don't want to get rid of this car but it's looking more and more like I might have to.

      "title": "Is it me or are video game showcases just not as exciting as they used to be?",
      "content": "So, I watched the Xbox showcase a couple days ago, and it just reminded me of what I've been thinking about for a while: how underwhelming most gaming showcases are these days. Why do I say that? Well, it's because ever since the deaths of E3, PlayStation Experience, etc., the more modern-day showcases have shifted to digital forms, and most of them have been extremely lukewarm at times. They just don't deliver the same amount of hype or quality that they used to when it comes to announcing games because they announce games that chase trends, over rely on live service, look unappealing, and other issues, rather than give announcements of games that actually stand out and give people the incentive to care about them and have an urge to buy them when they release. Now, I'm not saying every announcement at the newer showcases is bad, because some do look pretty great; I'm just saying that the more boring ones tend to overshadow the more exciting ones. And another problem is just how soulless these digital presentation are compared to the more in-person showcases were during the E3 days, and a lot of times, the people who host these shows just stand there, announce things so blandly, and don't do anything else that's interesting in the slightest. It's also as if these people don't even wanna be there and are just doing it to get their paychecks and go home. Also, what's the theme of these digital showcases? Where's the atmosphere? Why is everything so corporate these days? These problems don't only apply to Xbox showcases; they also extend to others like the State Of Plays, the Nintendo Directs (to some extent), and *especially* the dreadful Capcom showcases. 🤢🤮 And yes, I know that there are still in-person presentations nowadays like Summer Games Fest, but these SGF shows are extremely underwhelming and very rarely do they show any announcement that delivers any hype, and no matter how hard it tries, it'll never fill the shoes that E3 once had, and it makes me miss the E3 days more and more. Plus, SGF has the same exact issues I mentioned that the other shows do. And yes, there's also The Game Awards, and while they do have better gaming announcements than most other current-day showcases, it's not really saying much because they also tend to chase trends (especially with the infamous *Highguard* announcement) and most of the nominations and winners are questionable. I dunno, maybe it's because I'm such a boomer and I haven't gotten with the times and the general consensus has become more accepting of how gaming showcases have changed since the early 2020s, but all I know is that they're not as compelling as they used to be and it seems to me that they won't go back to how things were anytime soon. Heck, I feel like this is an underrated topic and very few people discuss it for some reason. Not to mention that very few videos on YouTube cover it for whatever reason. What do you guys think? Do you actually agree with the things I say or are you actually fine with how game showcases are these days? If you actually like how things are with them nowadays, then cool, more power to you; all I know is that I don't find them all that appealing anymore and it's a hill I'll happily die on. submitted by /u/New-Two-1349 to r/videogames [link] [comments]",

It’s a browser-based cyberpunk/hacking-themed game with a nice mix of active and chill progression. So far I’ve been having a lot of fun with the loop and the vibe. A few things I’ve liked early on: Battling NPCs as a core progression path (feels satisfying and easy to pick up) Dungeons for a more “run content / get rewards” style mode AFK tasks so you can still make progress even when you’re not actively clicking around Great community — I’ve had good interactions and it feels active/helpful Link: https://cybercodeonline.com/ Also just to be clear: no referral codes/links — I’m only sharing because it’s been a fun find and I figured the PBBG crowd might appreciate it.

      "content": "Hey y'all, the name is Burak. I am 21 years old and decided to drop out of university last august as it was not that much of a good place and I could find better education on web anyway. I was planning to apply universities in Europe and all but I missed the deadlines. So I decided to build an app. It started in early September and applied for closed testing on 1st of January. It was probably my most productive start to any year in my life. Anyway, Google has approved my production application a few days ago and I am trying to catch a momentum and realistic feedbacks from devs. It had to be an Android app as I did not have any iOS and mac devices. They are like 2x the price here and I did not have much use of them anyway. Building this has actually made me enjoy working. I feel guilty whenever I boot up a videogame. I built this for people who were like me. Not even to use but to inspire. Because everytime I had an idea pop up in my head, I'd overthink it, I'd try to learn it and then I'd find out I need so many things to learn. This time I just jumped in with the idea, otherwise I would never start. I know myself. If learning becomes too long of a process, there is a good chance for me to stop it. I had no idea what I was doing. Telling what I need to Gemini and using VS Code or Antigravity agents to execute. I build this like 3 times. I saw it evolve and improve. Points logic in database and Google OAuth made me insane with bugs and all. UI was pretty bad in first 2 versions and I keep them in my phone to see how much they changed. The aesthetics, name, features. It was like seeing a child grow if we put it in a more human perspective. Enough storytelling I suppose. inzone is for people who prefers competition over calmness. Forest is good and all, but I personally preferred a battlefield to motivate myself. That is what I did with inzone. User Card shows the individual stats and total points. Total points earns you places in the leaderboards. All-time leaderboard is there to see how far you came and monthly one is there to conquer. Focus sessions, goals, habits, to-dos, journals, all of them provides points to the users to compete. I have a few more features under construction to release in a week or two. And I also have a file where I keep update ideas, so this is not even the beginning of it. I won't leave a link as I do not want to get banned, this is not a promotion attempt anyway. I just need suggestions. Here is the marketing aspect of the thing: I pushed marketing away so much and it became something that I must do to get an audience to use my app. I am a confident person IRL but creating content for what I do kinda scares me. I know nobody really cares about what I do but still, feels scary. I really would appreciate some tips to start marketing my app without in a boring way.

      "content": "I'm developing a (WIP) hologram-style aesthetic for my game that uses a lot of transparent objects at present, and I know that transparency comes with a high performance cost (due to overdraw etc). What are the best ways to optimize my scenes and settings to minimize the performance impact of transparencies as I develop my visual style? The pic shown above runs fine in single player, but when I do 4 player split screen, the frame rate tanks. The picture above is a bit pathological, as I'm planning for a lower density/quantity of \"holograms\" in the finished look. I'm using Sprite3D with exported PNGs from Inkscape for the wall holograms show above, and have been experimenting with alternate approaches that map the image onto a quad/plane mesh (instead of using sprites). I've also experimented with converting the image from vector to mesh in blender and rendering the holograms as actual flat/planar mesh geometry too, which seems to be better for performance even in pathological cases, though seems to have pretty bad anti-aliasing at a distance... The rotating dial shown is probably a pathological case, because it's a multi-layer stacked hologram (multiple offset transparent sprites).

      "content": "I just released a new parameter based visuals application for MacOS 15+ (silicon only) that was written entirely in Swift and Metal 3. It's called RENDERWAVE. It's all compute and mesh shaders (no fractals whatsoever) and has some unique features like the controllable 3D objects, the steps sequencer, performance and creator modes. It does up to 8k output and supports syphon and midi. Would love to hear what you guys think! But please keep in mind this is a early version of it and it is a solo dev project at this time so go ez on me 😂 Sidecar app called SHADERFORGE coming by Q2 that will give u the ability to pull any shader, modify the code, then shove it back in or even code your own from scratch. But I'm constantly working on this thing and most releases come with new shaders too so there will be a lot to keep you on your toes if you're a regular performer. About me: Been in the game for decades. Promoter turned DJ turned AV Production turned obsessed with motion and light design. Always been a geek this is 3rd app but I've been doing web dev most of my life. submitted by /u/djweswalz to r/vjing [link] [comments]",

I'm constantly dying to falling or jumping over ledges or being pushed off them by attacks (both monster attacks and my own).. Is this because i'm using mouse & keyboard or constantly running? Or just part of the platformer design? Also - why can't I change rune orders on my weapons for different hotkeys? Needlessly annoying being able to unbind attacks like that. Some of the echoes also seem bugged and don't work (Revive and environmental damage)? Oh and the choppy FPS.. is that just AMD drivers or an optimization issue? I've messed around with it so much but can't seem to keep it consistent.

But I also possess a calm mind and critical thinking to know that this is a live service game which are meant to make changes and can be improved. Missing settings can be added. Gameplay changes can be made, added, or streamlined. Bugs and performance can be fixed. It's only day one. I can offer constructive criticism and hope the devs make changes, rather than attacking them personally. But sadly, I think this game's fate was decided a long time ago, I guess we'll see. But at this point I think the game will be shrouded with people who would rather it not succeed like it's a paying job. I truly hate the modern gaming community culture.

I thought I’d miss being able to play video games or write fanfic on the side. Basically, I was anxious that I’d miss being childfree. In a way, of course I miss those hobbies. And of course I miss being able to sleep in on weekends. But at the same time, I don’t feel like I’m missing out? Every moment with my baby is pure joy. Like of course it’s hard, but I don’t feel like I lost my freedom as many parents warn will happen. I even have a coworker teasing me by sending pictures of her binge watching a show with a text that says, “in case you forgot what it’s like to not have kids.” And it’s like, no I haven’t forgotten. And in my personal opinion, this is so much better. Not saying it’s objectively better for everyone. Just for me, personally, I love being a mom more than the life I had before. When my kid is older, I might even share my love for video games with him. Anyone else feel this way? Like how unexpectedly fulfilled a baby makes you feel?

Before joining us, he worked grilling burger patties and spent two years using all his part-time income to hire an animation tutor, trying to break into game development. He still couldn’t get hired anywhere. I didn’t hire him because he was already good. The animation quality in the demo clearly shows that. I hired him because he’s sincere, obsessed with games, and improving every week. I truly believe he can grow a lot before release. We fully accept the criticism. The demo has many rough edges, and animation is one of them. We’ll keep fixing and improving — that’s our responsibility. I just wanted to remind people that indie games aren’t made by studios with endless experience, but by real people who are still learning. Supporting indie, to me, means supporting that journey too.

Today during the snow day my 7 year old got interested in checking out all of my gaming controllers (I have…a lot) and I went and grabbed the 3DS to add to his pile. He accidentally turned it on and it had a full battery. He messed around making and playing with the Miis for close to an hour, so it wasn’t a fluke where it immediately died. It still has battery life. How on earth is that possible? It absolutely hasn’t been touched in over two years, and I’d be shocked if my husband had touched it in the two years before that. submitted by /u/hsalnow to r/Nintendo3DS [link] [comments]",

When I follow the steps there it always removes the Limine boot entry and is replaced with just UEFI boot, which I think is why it gives me an error on boot when secure boot gets enabled. I'm not sure if this is due to sbctl or if it's due to entering setup mode for custom keys. I've tried the method posted here ( https://discuss.cachyos.org/t/is-there-a-solution-for-making-secure-boot-work-with-limine-snapshots/8148/23 ) and that also does not work. Seems like every time I install sbctl it ends up wiping limine from the config, I have to run 'sudo pacman -S limine-mkinitcpio-hook' to add limine back into the boot entry.

For these effects I've made a shader that allows you to input 3 mask textures like gradients and noise and then mix them together using different blending modes. It's really just 3 sampler2Ds, vec2 for scrolling each (adding TIME to UV) and an int for which blending mode to use. What helped immensely was adding Cartesian To Polar Coordinates making the textures radial. I started out making uniquw textures for everything, but over time I realized that the blending allowed me to pretty easily reuse existing textures while still having unique results improving VRAM usage a bit. There's also dithering. Because transparncy can be a performance hit, I've added the option for two different kinds of dithering. There's fractional dithering and a kind of hybrid that cuts everything below 0.05, dithers everything below 0.7 usind ordered bayer 4x4 dithering and keep everything else opaque. I'm glad to help so if there's any specifics I'll try my best.

I am a college student and am studying chemistry which is very demanding and requires a lot of my time for assignments and lab reports etc. However, from literally the minute I wake up to the minute I go to sleep I am using my phone for something and it distracts me from the work I need to be doing for school or just anything I want to do with my life ie. reading more books this year, running, etc. I think I am lowkey addicted to reels ( I definitely am) and I have tried a lot of things to prevent me from spending too much time on insta but nothing helps. I got myself a flip phone for a while a year ago and used it pretty much every day for a month but even then there are practical things I miss about my phone that I just cant get with a flip phone like music, facetime with friends, calling, easy texting, etc. Just modern conveniences that make sense for every day life nowaways. But now its gotten to the point where I will be sitting playing a card game with someone or reading a book and its not enough for me and I feel this desire in the back of my head to be on reels scrolling, and even when I am on reels scrolling it just feels numbing and not even enjoyable anymore. Just like a mindless activity that doesnt do anything for me but I feel like I need it in a way. Now that im writing this I feel like a total addict but oh well thats what it is I guess lmao. Its just really hard for me to simply delete the app because not only do I use insta for talking to friends and family etc but I use it for work in a way too. Additionally I have realized that I cant stop myself from using my phone in the morning because I have it for my alarm clock and I need to open it to wake myself up. I don't know what to do anymore I feel like it has destroyed my ability to do work and feel fulfilled by it. Im also concerned that if I dont remedy this for myself soon it is going to become a permanent thing and it will bleed into my life as an adult when I have an actual job that I need to attend to every day and I cant scroll on reels because I need to work. Like as embarrassing as it is to admit when I do hw and lab reports or write essays I scroll on reels on the side while I do it to satiate my desire for freaking reels. Insane. I don't know. Maybe someone else has some insight on how they got over this. And I know I am not the only one because many of my friends have 5+ hours on insta alone every day in terms of screen time so I find it hard to believe that I am the only one noticing this. submitted by /u/FlounderOk9650 to u/FlounderOk9650 [link] [comments]",

      "content": "During Steam Board Game Fest and wanted to share Don't Freeze with the digital tabletop community. Design philosophy: Built to feel like a physical solo board game (Friday, Robinson Crusoe's solo mode, One Deck Dungeon). Core loop: - Navigate a location map (the board) - Manage hand of resource cards - Make strategic decisions each turn - Time advances based on actions (like action point systems) - Survive or die trying - Meta-progression between runs Why digital vs physical: - Automated bookkeeping (health, warmth, time tracking) - Randomized events/spawns - Save states for long sessions - But could theoretically be played with physical components Made it because I got motion sickness from FPS survival games. Turn-based solved that problem and ended up creating board game-style gameplay.

Whether you want to find a partner for pool/drinks at Peacock or Harrison's, someone to share a pitcher with, or just see who is looking to dance with you, it’s always a guessing game. So I built small platform to find. .. that helps you connect with people * in the same room\\ * for specific vibes * 🎱 Pool & Games: Find someone to challenge at the table. * 🍻 Drinks: Find a buddy to split a pitcher or try a new tap. * 💃 Dancing: See where the energy is high and who's on the floor. It's FREE.. and runs right in your browser. Would love to get some Corvallis feedback! It’s a web app (no download). Give it a try next time you're out!

I'm curious what people think of the design, in terms of \"character appeal\".

      "content": "Back in 2022 they released a mercedes skin that you could only get from buying an art book through them, but it was Japan exclusive. I just relearned about the Mercedes skin today and I looked into it and found out the code expires on February 9th of this year. So next month. The art book with the code is still being sold on ebay. If anybody was Interested in getting the exclusive skin with a pretty cool art book for epic 7. Just make sure the receiving date isn't later than February 9th and make sure that its the Japanese version. At the bottom of the front cover it will say the 2022 date and the 2026 date for February in Japanese. I went ahead and bought it cuz I thought it'd be cool to have 1) the art book and 2) a skin that I missed out on, since I've been playing the game since 2020. All you have to do is search on ebay \"epic seven art book with mercedes fluffy lady\" and it will show up. The good news is, is that its no more expensive than it would've been if you bought it from japan when it released cuz the I saw people talk about was like 40$ for the book and another 30$-40$ to ship it to the U.S. But anyways. I hope that anybody that does end up wanting it sees this post before it is too late I also don't know what to tag this as so I tagged it as art cuz it has to do with the art book submitted by /u/ParalyzedVeteran to r/EpicSeven [link] [comments]",

Sometimes the wagering is reasonable but withdrawals are slow, sometimes it’s the opposite. Other times the bonus looks generous but ends up being pretty restrictive depending on the games you play. I’m curious how other people here judge whether a bonus is worth touching at all. Do you focus more on wagering requirements, payout speed, game restrictions, or just past experience? Lately I’ve been comparing offers through breakdown-style sites like **iGamingNuts** instead of just reading the headline numbers, but I’d really like to hear how real players make that call. submitted by /u/Infamous_Spite_7715 to r/Casinos [link] [comments]",

This offer gives you £10 credit when you sign up with a referral link and spend the equivalent of £100 in foreign currency within the first 180 days. Steps: Sign up through a link, download the app, enter referral code NIDW78 https://www.currensea.com/refer-a-friend?utm_source=refer-a-friend&friend-referral-code=NIDW78 Enter referral code: NIDW78 Link your current account Chose the essential plan (free) and order the physical card for free Spend the equivalent of £100 in foreign currency (within 180 days of getting your card) I tried to game the spending from the UK by using the card to deposit into 2 investment platforms based in Europe and in the Euro currency. Neither Income Marketplace nor Profitus allowed the card to be used unfortunately. You can withdraw up to £500/day from an ATM fee-free.

      "content": "The King of Fighters 2001 is one of the least popular games in the KOF franchise, for multiple reasons (bad art direction, terrible soundtrack with some exceptions, disappointing story, etc.). And one of the reasons behind this game's infamy is how devoid of balance it is; there is a crazy amount of bugs, infinites, Foxy is too broken, and so on. However, The King of Fighters '97 is one of the most popular KOF games (especially in China), yet it's extremely unbalanced too, with lots of bugs and infinites and... you get it. Yes, it's true KOF '97 is better than KOF 2001 in multiple aspects (story, art direction, and the theme songs, despite being very few, are awesome). The topic of balance in videogames is something I have been thinking about during a couple weeks. Not just about SNK videogames; but also about other fighting games (such as Marvel vs Capcom 2), and even other genres. Some games are easier to break than others. Yet, when does a broken videogame still get fun in spite of (and sometimes because of) the broken stuff; and when does a broken videogame stop being fun because of how broken it is? When trying to balance a game makes it no longer fun? submitted by /u/Remarkable_Town6413 to r/SNK [link] [comments]",

      "content": "For me, big part of the games is grinding for gems. With normal mode, I can do 3 strongholds, 2-3 quests and around 100 nights in around 1 hour and 15 minutes (with allien). Thats 15gems for strongholds, 5 gems for 50 and 99 nights and 10-15 gems for quests - in total: 30-35 gems per 1 hour and 10 minutes. I never tried the hard mode, cuz i dont care about it, but I doubt you can do the 3 strongholds and, 99 nights and 2-3 quests in 1 hour and 10 minutes. The Hard mode, only gives you 7 extra gems for getting to 99 nights. In my opinion thats not worth it. Maybe if the devs doubled the gems from the stronghold, then yeah, I would try it for sure. What your thougts? Pls no wannabe tough guys that say you have to beat the hard mode just for the sake of beating it. submitted by /u/CantBStopped6 to r/99nightsintheforest [link] [comments]",

      "content": "I have heard “evo coming evo coming extinct” I am at a point where everyday I am obsessing about this cruyf card and I can’t be the only one. EA has been very blatantly just ignoring their fanbase for how stale their game has become content wise and the gameplay has become even more horrendous. Its starting to feel as if they want to frustrate the community on purpose, making me believe there is not gonna be a toty icon evo for my cruyf and he will not rise in price at all. I will likely hold bc he is very fun to use I really enjoy him. In other aspects people all swear by it to hold the card and that he is gonna go extinct like other cards whose evos were crazy good. Im just wanting to hear your thoughts if there are any traders, casuals, good long time players who know evos and the how ea does things that know a bit more about what to expect with investing or holding this type of card at this stage in the game. submitted by /u/Helios9James to r/fut [link] [comments]",

      "content": "After last Sunday it’s honestly insane that Sam Darnold isn’t the clear number one in MVP consideration and the only reason people don’t see it is because they’re box score watching casuals. If you actually watched the game you saw who controlled everything. Darnold dictated protections adjusted at the line and kept the offense on schedule all day. The Seahawks offense moved with purpose because of him not because of some stacked roster or gimmick scheme. His presence completely changes how defenses line up and how aggressive they can be. That is value. Meanwhile Stafford put up his usual empty production. A couple nice throws sure but zero control over the flow of the game. When things got tight he needed everything to be perfect around him. That’s been the story of his entire career. If the run game stalls or the script flips he turns into a high volume passenger. Darnold doesn’t need gaudy numbers to dominate a game. He forces defenses to respect the entire field he avoids negative plays and he keeps drives alive with decision making not hero ball. That shows up in wins not fantasy stats. MVP is about impact not name recognition or padded passing yards. If you watched last Sunday and came away thinking Stafford was more valuable than Darnold you’re telling on yourself. Sam Darnold affects winning on a level Stafford simply does not. submitted by /u/Correct_Sport_177 to r/NFCWestMemeWar [link] [comments]",

      "content": "I've been wrestling with this question for months as I work on my own project. There's this romantic idea that \"great games market themselves\" — that if you make something genuinely fun and polished, players will naturally discover it, streamers will pick it up, and word-of-mouth will do the rest. But then I look at Steam's \"new releases\" page. Dozens of games launch every single day. Many look solid. Some even look incredible. And most of them? Vanish without a trace. So here's my question: In 2026, with algorithmic feeds, influencer gatekeeping, and players drowning in options, can a truly great game still succeed with zero marketing? Or is \"fun\" simply not enough anymore? I'm not talking about AAA budgets — I mean even basic things like: - Building a community before launch - Reaching out to content creators - Running a Steam page with regular updates Have any of you seen games blow up purely on merit? Or is the \"build it and they will come\" philosophy just survivorship bias from the few lucky ones? Curious to hear your experiences — especially from devs who've shipped something. submitted by /u/Grass_SummerFlower [link] [comments]",

What The Fuck is wrong with you people ! i think everyone have learned by now rejuvenate released the witcher online mod, gaming \"journalist\" and influencer have made their bread and butter on it, i doubt people here didn't see atleast ONE article or one short about it but for those who don't know : a mod creator of the name of rejuvenate just have managed to make an online mod for witcher 3 despite the limitation of the game itself and released it for free on nexus i'm friend with him, we are part of the same modding discord i saw him those past few months work on it. Even if i saw it coming i'm really dissapointed by people reaction, i expected he'd get some negative comments but genuinely i'm flabergasted by the amount of hate he is receiving, on twitter (even sometimes reddit) people say his mod is shit because they expected a full working online mode like an actual online game, rejuvenate due to the limitation was able to make it so you explore the world together and see each other and speak, but he cannot sync the combat, he is currently working on syncing the horses of each players but thats all he can do. the amount of negativity he receive is really killing his moral, he worked for month on the mod and people insult him because it's not enough despite the fact it was the best he could do with what he is given, people that know nothing about modding or codding call him lazy, say his mod is dissapointing between other worse comment. i'm really sad for him and i'm mad at the community, modders aren't professional, it's a hobby, we don't have experience of actual devs studio neither the budget and more importantly, we are always blocked by the limits of the game itself. Rejuvenate released his mod for free and received more negativity than anything, i know some people who would have locked it behind a paywall, he get no money from it just insult and genuinely i'm sad to see the comunity act like that. the witcher online mod is a prowess to manage to make a game not built at all for solo online its impressive, yes there is somethings you can't do BUT IT'S A MOD ! not an update from cdpr ! and it doesn't excuse the behavior of some of you. and yes i see some comming \"yes but x game have an online mod and it work\" yes but each game is different, each engine, each code it's not because one game can another can reach the same level. i don't say you have to like the mod or even want to force you to use it. i'm just sad of the people reaction and dissapointed by the community, if you don't like it just don't instal it but don't insult the mod author it won't make him want to improve it, it will just demoralize him. submitted by /u/CranEXE to r/witcher [link] [comments]",

The shifter was a major reason I chose this setup, and driving without it significantly hurts the experience. The hardware itself is great, but the current Xbox support is very limited and not clearly communicated. Better game compatibility and clearer information on what “Xbox supported” actually means would go a long way, especially for new sim racers. submitted by /u/YokedGrinch to r/moza [link] [comments]",

I would love to have some of the maps from that game ported into CS as workshop maps (Such as: Rust, Province, Zone 9, …). Sandstone is probably the most well known map of them all and there are a ton of versions on the workshop. The problem however: 99% are Russian slop that ask you to download another workshop map to even be able to play on the map. (So heck no from me) I don’t know how hard it is to port the maps over (if possible) but it would be fun to see.

We’re a team of experienced devs (to various extents), but this is the first time we’re all working together in a new studio, so in short, your feedback genuinely matters to us at this stage of our development cycle. If you have time to try the demo (around 1–1.5 hours), we’d especially love feedback on: combat feel and readability whether the elemental interactions feel intuitive anything that felt confusing, frustrating, or unclear Steam demo: https://store.steampowered.com/app/4151000/Fading_Echo_Demo/ Thanks a lot for checking it out, and for any feedback you’re willing to share 🙏 Manu submitted by /u/Manu_NT [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Всім привіт! Ми щойно анонсували Sealbreakers — нашу першу гру як незалежної студії. Sealbreakers — це роуґлайт-екшен, у якому ви щоразу збираєте новий стиль бою. Нові прийоми відкриваються після кожної арени (як у Hades), і вони дають вам різні захвати, удари та підкидання (як у Sifu). Поступово складається унікальний стиль бою. Ви граєте за лицаря з братства воїнів, що після катастрофічної поразки століттями відточувало мистецтво рукопашного бою. Щоб повернути своєму братству честь, вам належить перемогти чотирьох безсмертних тиранів. Зробити це доведеться кулаками — лицарі дали обітницю ніколи не брати до рук зброї. Після катастрофи у світі Sealbreakers зіткнулися епохи, а час утратив значення. У пошуках тиранів ви побуваєте як і в прадавньому монастирі, так і в кіберпанковій антиутопії. І всюди без зброї. Сторінка у Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/4244460/Sealbreakers/ Ми — троє розробників з України, що багато років працювали в ігровій індустрії і нарешті вирішили зробити щось своє. Можливо, ви бачили наші пости про робочу версію Sealbreakers на GameDev DOU або у твіттері. Будемо раді бачити вас у нашому Discord-сервері. Ми плануємо багато тестувати Sealbreakers разом із гравцями і будемо вдячні за будь-який фідбек. submitted by /u/Junior_Investment472 to r/GameDevUa [link] [comments]",

It's been 3 weeks since I downloaded this game and I have reached Legend rank by using Support heroes like Floryn , Angela , Raefela and Estes. Is support emblem only work for healers? Are there no other hero who can utilise it? Why using support heroes is considered bad ? I had seen some of the discussions here saying that support at higher ranks are way worse. How long will it take for an average casual player to reach level 40 emblem for all? Why does Raefela is so underwhelming? I seen some post saying her passive does not work well with her kit now due to nerf , as such , support emblem still viable for her or not? Regarding Roamers role as a whole , Would hero like Johnson , Hylos or Grock are better than healers ? I mean , using a healer does make the match 4.5 vs 5 instead of 5 v 5. Sometimes I do feel like a dead weight because of my inability to hold the waves alone and relying on others instead , but I love healer roles as a general thats why I used them early when I was first introduced in this game. I will read all replies and cross question 🤧 if necessary , The game is so complex with all that build and all . submitted by /u/Dependent-Try-6190 to r/MobileLegendsGame [link] [comments]",

Is there a smarter (and free, or low cost) way to do this? Especially in-editor?

Were they expecting to have an amazing launch with an insane amount of player retention, thus driving revenue long-term? Somebody please either resonate with my confusion or educate me on how they would have actually managed to make money with this game. It’s got my head spinning. The only thing I can theorize is they are trying to monetize Highguard as if it’s another hero shooter. Similarly to how Marvel Rivals and Overwatch get a lot of their money from selling cosmetics.

I recently released an interview with the team behind Weast Coast Games all around branching out from being solely a branding and packaging studio to a board game company (and we talk pretty extensively around their design philosophy and process). Sincerely not trying to be spammy! I just figured folks in the sub would be as interested to learn about how a brand / company like this is built. I think it's pretty rare to get a look into how a studio like this balances craft and creative ambition with the realities of producing and selling physical products — and I hope you enjoy the conversation as much as I did!

It’s not enormous but at the same time not small or awkward to hold for a longer session. -Construction wise it feels very sturdy and has held up well in the short term. So hopefully that will last but time will tell. -The sticks, buttons and triggers are all smooth and very responsive. -Easily my favorite part of this and why it stands out to me is the ease of use and connectivity. It truly is plug and play with no Bluetooth settings to mess with, you just connect it via usb and you’re playing in seconds. The other big W for me is that I can use the S9 without having to take off my iPhone case. I have the 17 pro in a caudabe sythesis case (which is about an average size case) and it fits snug with it on there.

We have strong heros that can solo lane well. Even jungle if things were tweaked a bit. Bring in a draft system where we can discuss what lanes we want this could be a really strong system. Bring the shared economy down allow for hyper carries and supports that don't need eco, allow for a jungler to spend time farming the jungle and a mid laner that can rotate and I think it would be neat. Have the devs consider this? I know the community is split on solo lanes but that's primarily because the issues that come from the 4 lane system, no draft/lane pick/ and the economy doesn't really need those roles. But considering they went from 4v4 to 6v6 from 4 lanes to 3 I'd like to see them try it out. I'm yearning for the days of holding down my lane with a strong solo laner keeping an eye flout for ganks.

      "content": "So I'm currently playing DMC2 and noticed there's a map that looks vaguely as if Australia and South America are connected by Central America, and supposedly the game takes place in a nondescript European town. Since I've heard people say Dante (and by extension Vergil) is meant to be British, does that mean that the UK exists in the DMC world? Or is it an alternate version of the UK? For example, Lucia seems to have a French accent. So does France exist in this world as well? Dante doesn't have a British accent. I would assume Eva would be British, because demons aren't from England (as far as I'm concerned anyway). I'm really curious because so far I haven't seen many descriptions of what the world is like in DMC. Most towns seem deserted or abandoned. For Mallet Island it makes sense to be deserted, but I'm playing DMC 2 and it takes place in some random European town that doesn't seem to be inhabited some reason. And how do demons manifest in the human world? Do people summon them, or are there places that act as natural portals between the human and demon world? Or can really strong demons come and go between the human and demon world? About the timeline: since most of the locations have electricity besides demon magic and puzzles, but it's obviously not modern technology, would it be safe to assume the time period for DMC games would be the 80's or 90's? Or maybe the 2000's? Is there any official year for when the events take place? submitted by /u/higurashi0793 to r/DevilMayCry [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Like they did with blade dancer? This is a typical Russian game dev tactic. Release new class and make it OP and fun to sell max DLC copies. Later nerf it in time to sell the next one. I went through that almost every season with War Gaming games and whatever new OP tank they’re trying to sell. It’s pretty obvious Overseer is really strong so my guess is they will. Am I butthurt about blade dancer? Yeah, a bit. Kibellah is my favorite companion. Am I late to the party? Yeah I am. Was busy playing other games until now. People saying the debuff you get now with bladedancer doesn’t matter cuz the fight “is over in one round”. Which is pure BS. Besides maybe some easy random warp route fight on the ship, there’s many fight like the one on the stolen tithe ship where you’re facing two large groups of enemies one of which you can’t even reach until you hit the button nobody is finishing that fight in one round. So that debuff neutered the class and it sucks. submitted by /u/coldbreweddude to r/RogueTraderCRPG [link] [comments]",

(in which case, the diagram I used for example is a bit inaccurate. such a polygon would probably be fine. the issue is occurring for me on a polygon where one edge uses a large amount of baked_points gotten from a curve2D) this issue is confirmed present on godot versions: 4.3, 4.5.1, and 4.6 top: flickers, bottom: fine. box is viewport representation submitted by /u/Ok_Glass_2546 [link] [comments]",

Any app or software instances using my GPU will randomly freeze up, for example, if I'm scrolling a website in my browser it will sometimes stop moving completely, but then if I alt-tab to a different window and back, it will evidently have taken my input as I'm further down the page. I get the same thing with Spotify too, but slightly different - if I open a playlist on the app and start it then tab into work or a game, then when I come back to it later, the app is completely broken visually - but my input is still clearly being read. I was previously on a 3080, now on a 5070ti. I did a clean DDU driver install already when switching the cards out and it still persists. During this process I also changed my chipset drivers, flashed my bios with an update, etc. For more information: Motherboard - TUF GAMING x570-PLUS GPUs - Previously Palit 3080, now Gigabyte GeForce RTX 5070 Ti WINDFORCE OC CPUs - Previously AMD Ryzen 9 3900XT , I now have an 8-core AMD Ryzen 7 5800X3D RAM - 32GB, 3200MT/s, 2x16 GB sticks (can't remember the manufacturer, sorry) PSU - 1000W Cooler - Noctua Nh-d15 GPU Driver: Currently still on Game Ready 591.59 Monitor: MSI Optix MAG274QRF-QD Not sure if it makes any difference, but also noting here that I use DisplayPort. Bit of a vague post, believe me if I knew a better way to describe this I'd be looking through old forum posts and stuff, but if anyone could give me any new ideas I can run with I'd be grateful as this has been going on for a few months now.

      "content": "This is a long shot but maybe somebody has better search skills than I do. I'm trying to find a game that matpat played on GTA live It was a demo of an RPG type game. Top down, RPG maker style. Custom sprites. It had a battle system that was sort of action. RPG-like and I remember he only played up to a boss fight. The neat thing about this game is that it gave the player different choices and some of those choices affected what happened. The character was in a mansion type house and I remember there being a kitchen on the right and I remember there being a front door in the living room where this boyfriend and girlfriend would knock on the door and you could choose to let them in or not because a killer was after them. I think it was actually a cult that was trying to kill them, but I could be mixing games up. I remember that the character could get this magic power and so one of the attacks that matpat kept relying on was this vine attack stayed close to the ground. He had to dodge enemy attacks bullet hell style sometimes. This may have been the era when mirror Matt was there or even potentially when steph was on the couch but I don't think it was THAT far back. I swear the video had a tag title of \"killing my friends\" or \"a cult killed my friends\" something like that.

      "content": "Hello all, I (25yo female) and my husband (35 yo male) got married a year ago. We met thru work and dated for a year before getting pregnant and married in 2025. While we were dating, I knew I wanted to marry him bc he’s more mature than guys my age. We were aligned on things like house, finances, kids, big life things. There were things I had to forgive him on while we were dating . They still scarred me and gave me trust issues. I took advice from my mom that if the good outweighs the bad then I shouldn’t leave bc that’s what makes marriage work. The issue is he’s different now than when we first met. He used to never play video games, we were the outdoors/travel couple. Now all he does is go to work and come home and play video games every single day even on weekends, even when we have family who flew 6h to visit us. If giving the choice, that’s all he’ll do all day. I live my life with intention, I don’t relax until the house is cleaned, I work out and study everyday. On my days off, I plan things for us to do, road trips or trying new restaurants. If I ever play video games, I play with him cus it’s still productive since it’s spending time together. I feel that he has no ambition, no desire to have sex, no desire to spend time with me either. tl:dr He is just too comfortable. I can’t help but feel that it’s bc he’s old and stubborn. Alot of times, I feel like I’m wasting my youth and sexual energy. On the other side of the coin, we have a family, house, and life that we agreed on. Is this just how marriage is? Am I wrong for asking him to be more spontaneous and fun? My biggest fear is living a boring life like this - unromantic marriage. submitted by /u/Repulsive_Mall3372 to r/Marriage [link] [comments]",

      "content": "I’ve been wondering about a choice in the English dub, specifically why almost none of the characters speak with a French accent (with the notable exception of Esquie). What feels odd to me is that the game is very explicitly set in a version of France, the worldbuilding leans heavily into French culture and characters already include a lot of French expressions in their dialogues (cuss words but also more normal words like bonjour and mon ami). In recent years there’s been a growing trend across all mediums to preserve linguistic realism, especially when the setting is so culturally specific. Given that trend, I’m curious why the developers or localization team chose English accents here instead of French accents across the cast. Was this discussed in interviews or dev commentary? Was it a clarity / accessibility concern, a budget or casting issue, or a stylistic choice to avoid potentially \"bad\" or distracting accents? I’m not saying accents are mandatory, but given how prominently Frenchness is baked into the game’s identity, the choice stood out to me. Interested to hear others’ thoughts or any concrete info on the decision. submitted by /u/lunadiparmigiano to r/expedition33 [link] [comments]",

Steam friend code: 1840851733 Please don’t be toxic my sister and I share this PC, and she has important work files on it, so I don’t want to risk installing cracked games that could mess things up submitted by /u/Personal-Hat-3625 to r/StarWarsJediSurvivor [link] [comments]",

      "content": "I’ve been thinking about what’s actually missing to make the Steam Deck feel like a \"complete\" ecosystem, and I think it’s the lack of official non-game apps in the Steam Store. Imagine if you could just search \"YouTube\" or \"Netflix\" directly in the Store in Gaming Mode, hit download, and have it show up in your library with a proper UI. Why this would be a game changer: • No more Desktop Mode: Right now, if you want Netflix, you have to go to Desktop, mess with Chrome/Edge, and paste launch arguments just to get a \"kiosk\" mode. It’s a clunky barrier for casual users. • Native Navigation: On Xbox or PS5, the YouTube app is built for a controller. On the Deck, we're basically just using a web browser with a mouse-to-joystick layout. • The \"Living Room\" Factor: If Valve wants the Deck (and potential future Steam Machines) to dominate the living room, it needs to handle media as gracefully as it handles games. submitted by /u/Admirable-Design3391 to r/SteamDeck [link] [comments]",

So basically I am in this middle ground where I can't play the 'version' I tried because this game REALLY deserves my money but playing it without the DLCs will stress me out..

      "content": "Hey folks, After tinkering with polygons and sNgons, I finally gave birth to NgonPoly , a true first in Fusion’s 2D space. This little one isn’t just another shape — its perimeter stays a perfectly walkable polygon, no matter how you tweak the size, number of sides, rotation, or origin point. Sure, the demo looks rough (don’t judge the baby too harshly), but this proves we’re really playing in real 2D space here. Unlike the standard polygon that just messes with the image, NgonPoly’s transformations affect the polygon itself — no more annoying ratio distortion or perimeter mismatches. Exclusive features? Glad you asked: An input for any 2D object that lets you make it follow NgonPoly’s polygon and length, without writing a single expression . Customizable background and border colors to style your shape right from the inspector. And yes, this kid’s a bit hyperactive — ready to take on dynamic animations and shape morphs with high energy! This is a game-changer for motion design: precise control, accessible polylines, and smooth animations — all in one neat package. NgonPoly is just getting started, but trust me, it’s going places. And of course, when it’s fully grown and mature, it’ll be free for everyone to use and enjoy . If you’re into clean geometry and fun shape-building in Fusion, give it a look and tell me what you think! submitted by /u/Glad-Parking3315 to r/davinciresolve [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Hey folks, I’m a solo dev and for the past months I’ve been building Tasko , a small web app born from my own frustration with classic to-do lists. I wanted something that let me: visually plan projects (not just list tasks) see structure instead of endless checklists So I ended up building a visual workflow-style planner where you can map projects, routines, and steps in a more spatial way. It’s still early, but I just finished polishing the UI and core interactions. Here’s a screenshot of the current state https://preview.redd.it/iqo616h3e4gg1.png?width=2236&format=png&auto=webp&s=b3be7540c929e4ccbba9b1cb615e15d5284f669d So I have a question for you all: - does the concept make sense at first glance? - would you personally use something like this? -what feels confusing or unnecessary?

Kayla Skrlik displayed some of the worst sportsmanship I’ve ever seen in a curling game. Not only was the rock Sturmays to sweep, but her sister very clearly burned the stone and that’s nobody’s fault but her own. My biggest quarrel with this is how Skrlik made Sturmay throw her last stone even though the Skrlik stone was very obviously not shot. Remarkable unsportsmanlike behaviour. If I were Sturmay I would’ve simply pulled the stone off on account of Skrlik even making her throw that last rock. Sturmay handled it well. submitted by /u/Double-Outcome1103 to r/Curling [link] [comments]",

Although this is my first job, leaving aside my internships, I really feel like I am wasting my time because I don't see how what I am doing is helping me progress as an engineer.

For context, I have done projects to be used in labs at my university, and my thesis, which consisted of designing a complete IoT electronic product, won a national industrial award. The thing is, that hasn’t been enough to secure one of the few jobs in the field in my country so I have thought that if I do the CID certifications and also manufacture the circuits I make in the courses by myself for my portfolio, I might have better local or foreign opportunities. submitted by /u/Thin-Letter-8610 to r/PrintedCircuitBoard [link] [comments]",

The only other game I can think of with combos is the Mario RPG remake, which added super moves based on your party combinations. Are there any others? I don’t think Persona 5 counts because the showtime attacks don’t require both characters to actually be in your party. submitted by /u/El__Jengibre to r/JRPG [link] [comments]",

I wouldn't particularly say it's the world's best playing experience - holy shit do I feel spoiled comparing my current gaming experience to this, it's the same feeling as comparing contemporary games to, say, the I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream adaptation - but it's definitely a very nostalgic experience to boot up.

Dry Rot itself is extremely hostile to anything, and has grown to a larger size and strength than the other stumps by just devouring whatever stumps were in Hollowed Woods with it. https://preview.redd.it/dpq47ybzi5gg1.png?width=1065&format=png&auto=webp&s=9277dac2996959e371d39efa87d3927f14f2014c https://preview.redd.it/7xt3k8t1j5gg1.png?width=973&format=png&auto=webp&s=b9f4a340c4bcbd8e3b7313318ac829511cbd568a Stumps according to the actual in-game models are around 10 to 11 feet (3.0 to 3.3 meters) tall...

Sometimes I focus on modern games for a couple months, and then sometimes I focus on retro games. I prefer original hardware, but I mod or hack my consoles like my 3DS and PS2 to play Japanese games. Recently I bought a molded GBA with an IPS screen and USB C charger mod, suffice to say, sometimes I impulse buy cool retro stuff lol. Because that thing was not cheap. But it made me wonder, am I in the minority when it comes to playing retro games? Some indie devs like Jonas Tyroller think that game devs generally play a lot of games, yet others like Thomas Brush say they don't have time to play through much games with everything else in their life. submitted by /u/Chopdops [link] [comments]",

Does anyone know roughly how much gameplay time it takes to get to the point of needing to buy the expansions not included with the recent free code or VIP? I have VIP but dont want to buy the expansions until im near actually needing them. Is following the Epic quest line the easiest way to level? If yes, does it just linearly take you to level appropriate zones throughout the whole leveling experience? If no, can i just look at the levels by zone on the wiki and follow that? Should i just be doing the highest level quests i can? How does the instance finder work? Can i/should i use that at any point before max level? For reference i am fine with leveling taking however long it naturally takes, but i am not looking to get sidetracked. I want to actually get to end game in whatever is reasonable for the games pacing. submitted by /u/SWAGGIN_OUT_420 to r/lotro [link] [comments]",

Beelink mini, ryzen 5 6600u 16gb ddr5, built in amd 660m graphics, I know it's light, but it'll get me started. 43 and 32 TV's homemade controller out of my steam deck box w 8 buttons.. real high tech. Used baller installer So I set up as 2 screens. Put backglass, small dmd, topper, full dmd, music on 2nd screen. Baller doesn't say how many to set as \"visible\", both dmd's? Topper on disable, music off,sound only. Future pin games load ok, Only some actually show dmd and scoring. Vpx games are the most hit and miss, sometimes I have back glass, (finally figured I had to install b2s files), almost never have dmd or scoring. It's driving me frigging nuts. I've deleted and reinstalled the whole deal many times. Yet when I reinstall, a lot of my buttons setting were still there, even though I deleted everything I could find,windows was storing something somewhere... So I reinstalled windows, then baller. At least tables and back glass are in the right place now but still many issues with dmd's.. like backglass is showing OVER dmds. Anyone in NC want to make some money? I thought it would be a good project to put along side my real pins.. argh! Thanks submitted by /u/Kmcmorris to r/virtualpinball [link] [comments]",

I just wanted to reach out and see if anyone has found any more clues/hints or even possible theories about the Pandora's box? It's been moved to the secret room in the lobby, with a sticky note that reads \"Times almost up\", so, I think it's safe to say that we have a limited time to figure it out. I'm not exactly asking for someone to give me the code outright, just maybe some helpful points in the right direction, if anyone even has any ideas. I've seen a few posts but they're all from months ago and some are even about the first box that was in the attic. Thanks in advance for any help/advice! Edit: I would also like to add that I know there’s a possibility that it IS a timed in game event, that there is no way to know the code, but I’ve also seen photos floating around of a server message announcing people had opened it. Correct me if it is confirmed to be a timed event however. submitted by /u/yayeeties to r/regretevator [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Hey everyone! I’m deciding between two concierge jobs in Glacier National Park this summer and could really use some outside perspective. The options: Pursuit – East side of the park Xanterra – Lake McDonald (west side) Both are concierge positions. Important context: I will NOT have a car I’m hoping to make friends , be social, and spend as much time outdoors as possible This is a summer seasonal job, so overall experience matters a lot to me From what I understand so far: Lake McDonald / West Side seems more central, easier to get around without a car (shuttles, Apgar nearby, more people), and more social with larger employee housing East Side looks absolutely stunning and quieter, but potentially more isolated although I'm thinking I could have better access to hiking (without driving?) I’m torn because the east side scenery looks unreal, but I don’t want to end up feeling stranded or lonely if transportation and social options are limited. For those who’ve worked for Pursuit or Xanterra , or lived on either side of the park: Which would you choose without a car ? Which side is better for making friends and having a fun summer outside of work? Any major red flags or things you wish you’d known?

Yet, the game truly is at its best in multiplayer, when two players who actively.want to win grapple with each other. The game is built from the ground up around asynchronous play, so players don't need to be all online at the same time. Another way I'm considering is to not have matchmaking at all, and only run scheduled events — you don't need hundreds of players, just maybe 20 if they all show up at the same time. Besides, competitive aspect shines much more in an actual tournament environment rather than an impersonal ladder. What is some other advice you can give?

The only thing missing were some power-ups, à la the SNES' Baseball Simulator 1000 . The dev (Tipping Goat) is still answering questions on the forums/Discord, which is amazing for a 10-year-old niche game. Anyway, 98 of the achievements are boilerplate story/gameplay grinding achievements. 2 of them require some decent player skill along with a huge dose of luck to finish. (Double Rowdy and Pinball Wizard) The game never got in its way, and replayability is fun/easy enough to keep the hours reasonable and avoid a sense of tedium most of the time. (I left my game on a couple of times, so 48 hours is a gross overestimation of time needed. The hours take some time to figure out some of the pathways or cleverly hidden ones you need to track down.) submitted by /u/Zalym to r/steamachievements [link] [comments]",

The 4 from crew are basically free if you put in the time to find a max lvl crew in here that will let ya stay a week and help you out. Rookie 5 and 100 lifetime challenges also only take a week maybe 2. Basically its easy enough to get at least 7. My buddy got the game a week ago and has 10 already. This is basically a meta 6'8 that I set up to only absolutely need like 4 cap breakers to be quite usable online but still has useful spots for future cap breakers so you don't just feel the need to make a new build once you get them. First 7 go on the handle/SWB for 86/80. After that, 3 on 3pt for 92. After that, mid range and pass acc are both really solid options. submitted by /u/Himdoood to r/NBA2k [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Hello! I have a genuine question and I hope some of you could maybe help. I have been dabling into game dev for a few years now. I never got serious. And just made assets or concepts, I just did it as a silly hobby. Now I wanna get a bit more serious and make a small game to release for free. And maybe gradually get more and more serious with it. The problem right now for me is that I barely have any time after work to do it. And working on the Weekends is not really an option, as I usually work 6 days a week and need one full day for chores and to recover mentally a bit. I know discipline is important. But I genuinely come home from work and sometimes just \"pass out\" (Example: came home from work yesterday and I sat down on the couch to take off my socks and literally passed out for like four hours. When I woke up it was already kinda late to start working on anything. I only managed to cook dinner, take a shower and feed the cat) My 9-5 is more like a 6-6 situation. Where I wake up around 5 to get ready for work, then arrive home in the evening around 6-ish. Depending on the chores I have to do, I end up \"losing\" a bunch of time on cooking or cleaning or washing or whatever house related chore. And that without even spending time to \"unwind\" (like watching a video or reading something) So how would you approach this? Anyone in a similar situation? Getting a new job is sadly not an option for me rn. I imagine I'm not the only one in the situation. So besides the very obvious \"discipline\" is there a way to manage something like this? like maybe splitting up the chores? I already try to do the more time consuming stuff on the weekend? Do you, guys, have a specific way to do things or a schedule? I am very thankful for your answers. submitted by /u/Beef-n-goo [link] [comments]",

I tried Following Online Guidelines on capsules and library heroes, had to redraw Scenes to make the text more readable and fit Steam's Ratio. Took me a couple of days to get them how I wanted and I think it highlights the lighting of the game itself, this way I just had to crop them.

And just made assets or concepts, I just did it as a silly hobby. Now I wanna get a bit more serious and make a small game to release for free. And maybe gradually get more and more serious with it. The problem right now for me is that I barely have any time after work to do it. And working on the Weekends is not really an option, as I usually work 6 days a week and need one full day for chores and to recover mentally a bit. I know discipline is important. But I genuinely come home from work and sometimes just \"pass out\" (Example: came home from work yesterday and I sat down on the couch to take off my socks and literally passed out for like four hours. When I woke up it was already kinda late to start working on anything. I only managed to cook dinner, take a shower and feed the cat) My 9-5 is more like a 6-6 situation. Where I wake up around 5 to get ready for work, then arrive home in the evening around 6-ish. Depending on the chores I have to do, I end up \"losing\" a bunch of time on cooking or cleaning or washing or whatever house related chore. And that without even spending time to \"unwind\" (like watching a video or reading something) So how would you approach this? Anyone in a similar situation? Getting a new job is sadly not an option for me rn. I imagine I'm not the only one in the situation. So besides the very obvious \"discipline\" is there a way to manage something like this? like maybe splitting up the chores? I already try to do the more time consuming stuff on the weekend? Do you, guys, have a specific way to do things or a schedule? I am very thankful for your answers. submitted by /u/Beef-n-goo to r/gamedev [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Breakthrough! I'm happy to share - after weeks of thinkering - that moments ago I've found the solution to the \"Error code 18\" for Epic Games Red Dead Redemption 2 installed with NonSteamLaunchers in SteamOS. Or basically the tweaks to be able to run RDR2 with NSL. The great news is that it allows to run RDR2 directly, or via both launchers, in Desktop mode and Gaming mode. Whatever is preferred. Cloud saves, share game activity with friends and steam performance overlay all work when running RDR2 directly from Gaming mode. Also this saves money having to buy RDR2 a 2nd time on Steam, and no need to deal with Heroic or Lutris separately for just this game. I'll report the solution on ProtonDB as well. Summary: Rockstar and Epic launchers need to be installed from NSL (in same prefix folder ofcourse), latest GE-Proton10-29 (download via ProtonUp-Qt app) needs to be set (check force compatibility steam play) for both launchers ánd RDR2 game in Steam library, WINEDLLOVERRIDES=\"vulkan-1=n,b\" command needs to be added in the Epic launcher's launch options in Steam (do not add in RDR2 launch options!!!), Rockstar Launcher's launch options in Steam need to be copied in full and pasted in the RDR2 launch options in the Epic launcher game settings/properties!!!, in the file ../user/Documents/Rockstar../Settings/system.xml change the value for adapter to 1 but leave API value to DX12, now run RDR2 for first time in Desktop mode from Epic launcher, login via Rockstar Launcher and done. Hope this finds another! :) Cheers I've posted the solution at NSL GitHub too: https://github.com/moraroy/NonSteamLaunchers-On-Steam-Deck/issues/869 submitted by /u/ScubyFlying to r/SteamDeck [link] [comments]",

I wanted to capture the charm of the game’s voxel style and make a level that feels playable, busy, and fun — with traffic lanes, rivers, as well as large mascot builds as accompaniment display pieces. I've already built the whole thing IRL and displayed it at a LEGO exhibition last month. Seeing how positively people reacted to it made me realise I should at least try submitting it. Now, it’s already close to 200 supporters which has honestly blown me away. I did discover there’s another Crossy Road project already up — and I genuinely hope both get support, because it’s a game that means a lot to many people. If you’d like to support it, I’d be incredibly grateful ❤️ submitted by /u/stowball to r/legoideas [link] [comments]",

      "content": "I've been wondering about the performance difference in games where enemies are constantly creating and destroying instances of their state classes, versus an approach where enemies cache their state and simply reset the values when jumping back to a previously used state. I haven't tested it myself since I'm very new at all this and haven't really got the time at the moment, but my best guess is the former is more cpu intensive while the latter uses more ram. So as usual there isn't a \"best\" solution and it all depends on the needs of the game and its bottlenecks. Either way I'd like to read the opinions of experienced devs on the matter, maybe the caching is a bad idea, period, and the traditional way is always better, but due to recent performance-related issues with modded minecraft due to the garbage collector I'm inclined to think otherwise (or maybe that's just java and/or mimecraft's code jankiness). submitted by /u/Y-oshirin [link] [comments]",

      "content": "At this point, where all phones work great for 90% of users, what distinguishes one brand from another, in my humble opinion, is update support (Android updates and security patches) and the speed in applying them. In that respect, for example, the Pixel, with its seven years of updates, is unbeatable. So, if you buy a OnePlus, it will work perfectly for many years (my OnePlus 7 still runs like a dream today), but after five years, you'll have a fantastic phone without updates or security patches, making it insecure and, for many people, useless. So, I don't understand the point of making these phones so great and then not providing better support for them. From 2027 onwards in Europe will be required that the battery be easily replaceable by the user, and I hope that Europe will also promote progress in the updates. Of course, no one from OnePlus or OPPO will read this. submitted by /u/omgletmeregister to r/oneplus [link] [comments]",

I also can create packs for your indie games specifically! In case you may support; https://archonei.itch.io/pixel-art-mega-tree-pack submitted by /u/entei55 [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Hi everyone, I've been working on a proof-of-concept web app that lets you play PICO-8 multiplayer games online with your friends. PICO-8 multiplayer games are designed for local play and you need everyone physically on the same keyboard or controllers. There is no native way to make online multiplayer games in Pico-8. How It Works With PICO Party, one person hosts a room and everyone else joins with a 4-letter room code. The host's browser runs the actual PICO-8 game and streams frames to all players via a peer-to-peer connection (WebRTC). Remote players see the game in real-time and their inputs are sent back to the host, where they're injected directly into the PICO-8 runtime as if everyone was pressing keys on the same machine. Will work even if users are on different networks. This means any PICO-8 game with multiplayer support works out of the box . No cartridge modifications needed if your game uses standard btn() calls with the default bindings. You can play multi-cart games and also use play any custom game as long as you have a link to the .p8.png url. Players can play on mobile with touch controls: a virtual D-pad and action buttons. Great for playing with friends who only have their phone. Try it at: https://picoparty.io Submit Your Games! The current library is pretty small. I've basically just been adding games I have been playing with my friends. If you've made a multiplayer PICO-8 game (or know of one that would work well as long as it is Creative Commons 4.0 or you have the author's permission), I'd love to add it to the library. Just open a PR at https://github.com/dwjiang/pico-party-games with: Cartridge URL (.p8.png) Game name, author, description Player count (min/max) A few screenshots Once the code is merged, the change should trigger a deployment and you should be able to see your game in the app within minutes. Future Feature Ideas If there is interest, I can continue to develop the app. Some ideas that I have: Audio streaming - Currently only video/frame data is streamed. Working on getting game audio to remote players too Public lobbies - Find random players to game with Cartridge discoverability - Allow users to sort by popular/newly added cartridges Saving progress - Saving cartdata so users can continue previous sessions. If there's a feature you'd want, let me know. Feedback Welcome I would love to hear what you think, any bugs you find, or games you'd like to see added.

I did it because I wanted to support the community — both on Wayfarer and in Pokémon GO — especially in smaller towns where there are very few PokéStops. I put a lot of effort into my submissions because I actually care about improving the game for other players. What I don’t understand is why people like me get punished for supposedly “small mistakes,” many of which I strongly disagree with or which are simply not true. In the end, you receive a negative mark, and all motivation is gone. It feels incredibly discouraging. What makes this even worse is that there are clearly people who ignore criteria completely, submit low-quality or abusive content, or otherwise misuse the system — and they often seem to be overlooked and not punished at all. That is extremely frustrating. Instead of focusing on those who clearly break the rules, the system seems to target players who genuinely try to help. Because of this experience, I’m honestly at the point where I don’t feel like doing anything for the community anymore. And that’s the real shame here: the people who put in the most effort to improve the game, especially in rural or smaller areas, are the ones being pushed away. I think this is something the Wayfarer community and Niantic really need to reflect on, because this approach drives away the very players who want to contribute positively. submitted by /u/ugartecard to r/NianticWayfarer [link] [comments]",

You clean up crimes, complete jobs, and eventually build your own empire. Unlike typical tycoon games, everything is scripted like a story-driven AAA title. Every action and event is part of a carefully crafted narrative. Here is the thing. So far, it mostly feels like a walking simulator. I really do not want that, so I would love suggestions for mechanics that make the gameplay engaging while keeping it story-driven.

What I built: A tactical card game with priority-based combat. Unlike simultaneous reveal games, one player commits first (card revealed), then the opponent reacts knowing WHAT card but not HOW MUCH resource they're committing. Creates constant mind games. The journey: Started as a tribute to my fond memoried of playing the web based Urban Rivals growing up. Grew to 70+ characters Built deep lore for every character. Added ranked ladder, seasonal rewards, cosmetic marketplace Solo project Tech stack for the curious: iOS native (Swift/SwiftUI) Cloudflare Workers backend D1 database Real-time matchmaking At launch: 70+ characters (all free from start) 6 factions with unique clan bonuses 8-card decks, 2-4 min matches Cosmetic-only monetization 📱 Pre-order: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/elarion-aetherfall/id6754101666 2 days out.

The code conan originally received was in Japanese but in English it translate to this- \"I'm a major league slugger. This is the beginning of extended inning game...? It doesn't matter if you prepare a good stopper... I will turn around the game in the end...\" So here is conan deduction P1- Major league refers to a American baseball league. C1- The entire code must be decipher in English. P2- A good stopper in baseball refers to strong earned run average statistics or Era. C2- The abbreviation of earned run average is Era. P3- Extended innings game in baseball can also be called extra inning games. P4- If you remove Era from Extra it leaves XT. P5- if you put XT vertically and move 180 degree then it represent the Japanese Kanji 文. P6- Kanji 文 represent schools. C3- The bomb is in a school. Now, conan cuts the wire of the bomb in the elevator 3 second before it blast. It result in conan to not get the whole clue but the part of it which was EVIT(unlike the letter this was English even in original translation). P7- Evit turned around will come out as tive. C4- The whole word is actually detective with tive being it's last part. P8- Detective in Japanese is 探偵(Tantei) P9- Reversing 探偵(Tantei) gives you 偵探(Teitan). P10- There are school with teitan 偵探 in it. C5- Mixing P10 and C3 it comes out that the actual place of the bomb is teitan school. P11- There are 3 teitan schools. Elementary, middle and high school. P12- The culprit behind the bomb is targeting people in it attacks intentionally. P13- In winter only teitan high school is active cause of there exam. C6- The bomb is in Teitan high school. Tge reason why this deduction is so hard or good is cause there are no guesses, induction or abduction. Each step follow necessarily from the pervious. And it is also very hard as conan has to realise many thing during the deduction process like- \"MAJOR LEAGUER\" → TRANSLATE TO ENGLISH \"GOOD STOPPER\" → ERA → REMOVE FROM EXTRA → VISUAL ROTATION INTO KANJI \"EVIT\" ON A BOMB LCD PANEL → REVERSE DETECTIVE → JAPANESE REVERSAL → TEITAN And also conan was in extreme pressure while also psycoanalysing the bomber and he correctly deduced 2 separate cipher joining them flawlessly with a countdown.

When in desktop mode, it completely disables every button on the device, so I can’t pull up the keyboard to type in the security code. Is anyone else having this issue? I’ve tried some fixes I’ve read online, but no hope. I’m not going to uninstall and re-install as the download is 120gb, so it will be a refund if that’s my last hope haha (I’ve tried different protons, I deleted the EA app and let it re-install and I’ve tried to do it in desktop mode) submitted by /u/nickldn28 to r/SteamDeck [link] [comments]",

      "content": "I'm making a Dungeon Crawler Rogue-Like using structure blocks, trial spawners, vaults, decorated pots and utilizing Loot Tables for all of my rewards found in the dungeon. But to actually make the game play like a Rogue-Like I'd love to have unlockable items. To my knowledge there's no way to modify a loot tables without going into the file and directly editing it. But if there is a way, that would be amazing. I had an idea to pull it off where if an item that isn't unlocked yet spawns, I can detect that and kill the entity and replace it with an unlocked item before the player picks it up. I'm not using Chests anywhere in the dungeon, so items will basically always exist as an entity at some point. But ideally, actually modifying the loot tables would be amazing. I'm not all the familiar with Loot Table Functions yet, I know how \"set_count\" works but that's kinda it. If a function could check an in-game Score, or something of the like, and then completely change the item, that would be awesome. Alternatively if it can't change what item it is, maybe it can change the other item data? Like enchantments, custom name, and custom attribute modifiers? That wouldn't be as good, but still really helpful. Thanks! submitted by /u/BenManGinger to r/MinecraftCommands [link] [comments]",

Now Loki isn't the broken per say, but his very existence makes these ultimates even worse to deal with \"Oh you're having trouble countering insert the OP support ult that comes with every season how about you do it twice!?\" Now for how I would fix this issue I must first put up an amazing example that just happened to me in a match. Friend is playing Loki and in overtime the enemy CnD ults. Now it would seem like the only option is to copy your other support and stall the game. Except....this genius bastard copies the enemy MAGNETO and takes out the CnD and their Bucky with his ultimate. Then proceeds to help our tanks push the other team away, winning us the match. Noe THIS! this is the type of playmaking you'de from a GOD OF MISCHIEF!! So to keep encouraging these type of plays, I would simply make it so the Loki's that copy ults from their tanks or dps get rewarded with stat buffs if they manage to get off a kill. Like: you double ult with your Punisher and manage to wipe away the Luna ult? Congrats now for 30 seconds you have increased damage and lowered cooldowns! Oh You copied your Strange and stunned and killed the diving Magik and Daredevil? now You have 200 overhealth and your runes get 100 more hp for 40 seconds! Oh you copied your strategist!??? you get nothing and your copied ult starts at 95% instead of the normal 100% I don't want to take away the option to just copy your other support, but instead i want to increase the value in making risky plays!

      "content": "Created an UpdatePartComponent step to begin to separate the physics update from the internal vehicle update logic. Moved RocketCore and RocketNozzle update logic from the physics loop to Rocket.UpdateRockets. Moved ResourceManager from RocketNozzle to RocketCore to increase the separation between core (internal) and nozzle (external) association. Added propellant mass flow rate to nozzle and core readouts. Fixed very excessive propellant usage due to a sign flip in the consumption logic. Created FxTemperature part component to drive emission and thin film intereference maps. For the moment, this is driven purely from nozzle temperatures. Added FxTemperature component to SubParts with models and components that support it. Removed ResetState() method from PartComponentStateful as it was no longer needed. Fixed a few bugs with higher order symmetrical editing, added a few bugs with higher order symmetrical editing. Swapping between symmetry orders with multiple layers of symmetry inheritence is still a bit touch and go. All in all, going in the right direction. Use PartComponent.TryGetFrom() in a few places where it's less verbose and updated some related doc comments. Added a method to get mutable access to part component states for serialization and UI-context modification. Fixed a case where part components would incorrectly think that they couldn't be updated, leading to emissive maps not working. Improved behavior of temperature emissivity sim, especially for engines at low throttle. Increased maximum temperature for thruster emissive by 1.75 times. Increased thruster emissive intensity. Merged Part and SubPart classes. This should allow us to simplify quite a bit of logic doubling. This is not meant change the player-facing functionality of Part vs SubPart in the game. Quite a bit of clean up is still needed and given the wide reaching changes unintentional regressions should be expected. Return individual TStates and TFxStates by reference instead of by value from PartComponentStateful.StateList. Added individual component and state getters to PartComponentStateful.StateUpdater to match the interface of PartComponentStateful.StateList. Moved the Tank processing from the old TankList to the new PartComponent/State system. Made hot path initialization for type updaters infallible to avoid the infectious complexity of null checking in the vehicle update task. Removed the isEditorUpdate flag for vehicle updates which no longer has a purpose. Created an InertMass part component and shifted readers to use that instead of the template. Added in missing part components from top-level parts. Removed unused PartTree.TotalSubstanceStorageVolume. Moved one last mass template reader over to the part component. Converted engine and thruster controllers into part components. Created a GetSubtreeComponents() function to iterate over all part components of a given type for a part and its sub parts. Fixed a few accessors in PartComponent.List which weren't returning the concrete component type correctly. Return sub parts as a span instead of a collection. Removed thruster/engine controller properties on PartTree. Converted the subtree components generator into a ref struct enumerator to avoid allocation and used it in an additional place. Removed some redundant code left over from tanks moving to part components. Moved some PartTree functionality out of the Part class into the PartTree class. Added a Split function to the PartTree class. Tightened access to the Parts list in PartTree so that it must go through PartTree functions so we can eliminate logic errors where other code outside this class could change the Parts list in the PartTree without performing other related logic in the PartTree. Changed the public Parts collection in PartTree to be a readonly span. Made the static part list on PartTree private. Marked two PartTree lists as readonly. Use GetSubtreeComponents() for inert mass display. Fixed some pipelines being mislabelled as 'Byte[]' Fixed potential issue in Physics IntegrateVelocityVerlet where mass properties were not set for initial state causing a mismatch between first derivatives and half-step derivatives. submitted by /u/panic_in_the_galaxy to r/kittenspaceagency [link] [comments]",
