It looks like a code marketplace so obviously due diligence if you buy, but I can confirm I bought it and used PayPal to be safe and got a code for the game 2 mins later - which works perfectly. They also say they provide a guarantee on all purchases. I think normal price is about 7-9 bucks on there so it’s a steal no matter what when compared to PSN price. Super fun game!

He’s really really messed up from his bad relationship with his dad, and he takes it out on everyone around him, like if anyone in the show needed a therapist, it was him… Taking ALL Of Franklin’s money was purely a power trip game, I had the exact same questions as Franklin, why did he take the whole 73, why didn’t he just leave him enough to transition, he WANTED Franklin to fuck his life, he could have left him even 10-20 mill. The way he justifies things are so warped, like talking about how “You left me Franklin”, as if Franklin had any choice about the fact that Louie went behind his back, and forced him out. Louie and Jerome would have done the work for Teddy if they didn’t have to go to war with Franklin. Like he can’t see how his actions might be what rubs people up the wrong way, instead he always says how “I can’t believe they’re behaving like this” and the behaviour is a very normal reaction to his cruel behaviour. And I think he gets this from his dad. Everything Teddy does, even the way he talks, it’s like he’s gotta make sure everyone knows “I’m the one in charge”, even proposing to Parissa seemed a bit premature.

Basically, I understand what an idea's guy is and why it's a bad thing. It's just a guy who is stuck in the \"consumer\" mindset and has no plans of entering the \"producer\" mindset. They don't actually want to make a game, they just want someone else to make the game they want to play. This is someone you should call out. They'll probably be delusional forever if you don't actually give them a reality check. Games aren't made with wishes alone. Also, game development isn't this horrible thing you should avoid doing. They should be made to face their own self-doubt instead of hiding it behind their enthusiasm. I don't know because I have stopped making games a while. I couldn't actually get into it due to personal issues. It's just the flow the universe, it's not some evil thing. Making games should be fun. submitted by /u/Motherfucker29 [link] [comments]",

      "content": "I've been digging into classical Islamic rulings on slavery and it's left me genuinely confused. From what I understand: Quran 4:24 explicitly allows Muslim men to have sex with female captives/slaves (\"those your right hands possess\") even if those women were married before capture, the prior marriage gets overridden. Classical fiqh (across major schools) says the owner's sexual access to his female slave doesn't require her consent; refusal without \"valid excuse\" can make her disobedient and subject to discipline. Consent isn't treated as a legal requirement in the premodern texts, ownership itself makes it licit. Modern Muslims say slavery is abolished and these rules are historical, but the text itself permitted what we'd today call non-consensual sex with war captives (including married ones), which looks a lot like sexual coercion/rape by modern standards. So honest question: Does the fact that the Quran carves out these exceptions (without requiring consent) show an inherent misogyny or supremacist framework baked into the religion?

You had to make yourself an account, kinda like in movie star planet and then you could go shopping on that big street where you could swipe to the right and there were more stores. It was 2d and had kind of a cool style. The characters didn’t have that cheap looking giant head style i think. I remember your character being kinda small but idk how much that helps. I think it had kind of a story to it and you had to unlock stuff but i’m not too sure anymore. I remember making many new accounts because I always forgot my login. Hope anyone knows what I mean haha:,) submitted by /u/LaurinnnnYeeee to r/tipofmyjoystick [link] [comments]",

      "content": "The actual reality, people are too dumb to realize that legendary rarity doesn't matter more than gun effects... Also reality, quest rewards and unique items used to be legendary quality gear that was easily refarmable and had a 100% drop chance as it was a quest reward... Third reality, there's nowhere to reliably farm purple items in BL4. The world events should be this place as they are easy to spawn and are all mobbing content... The removal of unique items in BL4 is what starts the legendary grind and intensifies it, as they removed the alternative legendaries you got as quest rewards (uniques /blues-greens with legendary effects)... BL2 had pretty damn low drop rates for alot of items but guess what? Nobody cared because sandhawk, pimpernel, lady fist, fibber...i can easily keep going... Even BL3 had some unique items that were fire, they just got power creeped out of relevance therefore making the endless legendaries of BL3 the obvious better choice... If they actually had fire ass blue weapons as quest rewards then this whole legendary grind shit wouldn't even be such a big deal, but since legendaries are the only option now it *feels* like that's what you need to casual players.... Casuals aren't gonna be making DOT stellium builds or testing out new tech, which sucks because there's aloooot of insane purples in BL4 but it is what it is... I think since they've basically removed an entire section of legendaries by removing uniques, they need to compensate that automatically by having the legendary drop rate be way higher... This circles back to my original point that I made in a random comment days ago, but bl4 would benefit from bl3s legendary drop rate even better than that game did... At least that's my opinion...thoughts?... submitted by /u/WhoIsEnvy to r/Borderlands4 [link] [comments]",

If the players sit facing each other around the table, they'll have difficulty reading it (since it's upside down). This could also confuse them. I thought about making cards with the staff in both directions, but that would make the card too bulky (since it would be upside down, the card would have to be very large). I considered having the players sit side-by-side on the same side of the table, but that limits the number of players (otherwise their arms would be too short to reach the central draw pile). Do you have any other ideas? Thank you for your help. submitted by /u/Visual-Wave-9245 [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Whatever designer did this is an absolute moron. “wide open” means there is zero defensive pressure, and on top of that, there is no imminent defensive pressure. The shooter has all the time they need, and they know it. “open” means there is zero defensive pressure, although the defense is nearby. There might not be a hand in the shooters face, but there’s the threat of one on the way. “contested” means a defender is having SOME impact on the shot. Maybe their body just being a little too close for comfort would give you 5%; very makable. A hand darting towards your face, maybe 15%, and makable. Jumping with you during the layup and forcing you to use the rim to protect the shot? Maybe 25%, and you can still make it, tho a few might bounce off the rim or backboard awkwardly. Closing on you with hands up and getting uncomfortably close? Maybe 30%, and you’ll miss some shots. Shane Battier sticking your hand in Kobe‘s face? Maybe 85, and unless you are the 2k version of Kobe, it likely isn’t going in. I don’t know why this is so hard for the makers of this game. You can have low contests that don’t have a wild impact on shooting. Everything doesn’t have to be open. submitted by /u/TheLordAshram to r/NBA2k [link] [comments]",

That was lifted directly from vamp survivors with no real effort, and it shows. Probably also the reason why most of the modes allow you to select your full loadout before you start. No, what I was enjoying about the game was it's grindy little out of game progression. Collecting pets, and gear, and tech parts and all the other bits and bobs, and cleaning them up in my inventory. Merging in to better ones, basically playing invently zooma. But it's all held together by gameplay that, lets be honest, was never good, and the devs did nothing to make it better. So I was thinking, do you guys know other games with fun long term progression, but also primary gameplay loop that is not an afterthought? Oh, and I don't spend money on mobile games and use adblock dns, so f2p experience can't be held together by spamming ads. submitted by /u/myhv to r/AndroidGaming [link] [comments]",

They are the ones most often used in switches and the ones most likely to guard almost every position on the floor. They both play extremely hard and never take plays off. Kon especially for a rookie not only plays solid d but has understood right away all the hard to get stuff when it comes to switching, positioning, etc when running an nba defense.

      "content": "RCB being put in to bat first today just exposed all the cracks we’ve been hiding so far. Yes we won the first two games while chasing but the moment there is scoreboard pressure this batting lineup is completely falling apart. There is no intent no partnerships and wickets keep tumbling every few overs. What makes it even more frustrating is the decision making from the dugout. Sending Radha Yadav at number 5 is already a red flag and makes absolutely no sense while Georgia Voll sits on the bench despite being someone who can actually handle pressure and build an innings. Instead we persist with Linsey Smith who is clearly not required as there are multiple bowling options and I don’t understand what the coaching staff is thinking by not bowling Radha and not using an over or two by grace. They keep persisting with the same 11 and still keep losing wickets regularly. That is not Gujarat bowling something extraordinary that is RCB gifting them the game. Malolan has to take responsibility here because this is not a lack of talent issue it is about how that talent is being used and right now it feels like we are losing matches in the selection room rather than on the field. submitted by /u/cosmichero18 to r/RCB [link] [comments]",

Knowing how good the warframe community was back in the day, and hoping it hasn't changed a bit in the time i've been gone, i'd like some helping in getting up to date with the game. some ppl on the warframe chat just kept saying \"just go read patch notes\" which i could but its better to know from the ppl who have been playing the game in my absence. any suggestions are welcome as i'm just overwhelmed with whats going on and also the fact that players with much lower MR than me are doing way higher damage than me; its kinda making me feel useless in quests. thanks for your suggestions in advance https://preview.redd.it/4rwlr7mfeqdg1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=8c6c51b522409d8f86945e25590c279bbd4cb617 submitted by /u/Western-Cockroach295 to r/Warframe [link] [comments]",

      "content": "I was going through the Crystal Guardians set from 2006 the other day and reminiscing how cool it was Pokémon centered an entire set theme on Crystals. The Celebi gold star is of course a banger but there are a lot of cool cards in that set. The next set release Dragon Frontiers also was theme specific. Stacked with dragon pokemon. We actually got Charizard & Rayquaza in the same set! Unheard of nowadays. Now I know you can point to recent sets like Destined Rivals and 151 and say those have themes. Sure, but the themes are what I would consider abstract. I just wish Pokemon would return to making sets about something concrete. Like an awesome Dragon focused set. Instead we get an underwhelming Charizard-only release like Phantasmal Flames. I know everything has to tie into the video games anymore but you’d think they could do a better job of giving us solid theme releases. Instead of Abstract sets like Journey Together, Perfect Order, Twilight Masquerade, Temporal Forces, etc. It would be refreshing to see a return to a more vintage era focus on types of Pokemon and cool artwork. I also think it helps people understand the Pokemon universe better. So many newer people to the hobby have no idea what the types of Pokemon even are. They just know the name. Which undercuts a big chunk of the game and hobby itself. Types matter and bring a richness to the overall experience. That’s missing from modern releases and something I wish would return. submitted by /u/LegoRedBrick to u/LegoRedBrick [link] [comments]",

Today i was supposed to work at 6:30 am and from the outside looking in i had prepared efficiently for the work day ahead; except i couldn’t fall asleep. i was in my bed and my whole day (which was a good day; i drove myself to the park, treated myself to lunch, watched a movie, did laundry, showered, had therapy) was replying in my head in a form of song. There was music that filled my day at each step and things i did, and those songs were repeating in my head all night along with memories of the things i did; i saw. I called into to work because i did not sleep, i think the anxiety of work but also the anxiety that filled my day because it was soooooo busy lingered all night. I think i understand how even though the stress was “good” it still amp’d up my anxiety and made it difficult for me to sleep. Maybe because i liked my day so much i felt like i was buzzing all night? I never understood before that good feelings can affect my sleep in such a way; and even if i may feel sad about staying in the house all day and playing my fav video game, thats literally what i need to do to be able to do at least the day before i go back to work so i can sleep well enough.

Curious what you think of it. I guess there's a quiet a bit emphasis on the \"DO ask questions\" part, but that's mostly because most players I've played with just. won't. freaking. ask. any. questions. And it's infuriating to me that they never interact with pretty much half of the game, simply because they don't ask any questions and thus don't even know that it exists. Also, fyi, the last part is specific to my games. I usually tend to play homebrew games, and, while I have a general draft and timeline of events, I create maps and encounters in between sessions. So, If my player don't share their plans with me, and I prepare everything for Place A, only for them to decide they'll head to Place B, we'll have to cancel the sesssion, because I don't have anything ready for Place B, submitted by /u/FutureNo9445 to r/DnD [link] [comments]",

I don't care if... -They function similar to the default skins in that when you select the skin on Old Man it allows you to randomly wear one of the three until you die. -They give other characters like Mask Man or Bag Man the other two. It would make sense to me if the center mask was for Mask Man and the far left was for Bag Man. -Extra challenges to unlock them similar to the ways we can unlock the current mask for Old Man. -They give them in a DLC pack. I love the game; I don't mind spending some extra money to support the game for the two masks on the left. The masks are already in game so it can't be that hard to implement them for your characters. Where do I need to post this or who should I send it to. The Devs must know we want these masks.

It’s just… annoying. One extra step. A disabled button. A warning. A quality loss. A watermark. That single layer of friction is enough. Behaviorally, even a small obstacle reduces follow through by orders of magnitude. People defer. They assume someone else will save it. They assume it will still be there later. They move on. At scale, this produces a bystander effect applied to information: everyone witnesses, no one preserves. The result is a form of soft historical erasure. Content technically exists, but only ephemerally, inside feeds optimized for forgetting. Without easy saving, there is no personal archive. Without personal archives, there is no collective record. Without records, patterns can’t be proven, reversals can’t be compared, and narratives can’t be held accountable over time. This is not an accident of bad UX. Platforms know exactly how powerful friction is. If they wanted people to preserve content, they would make it effortless. Instead, they’ve made preservation socially and cognitively expensive while keeping consumption frictionless. It’s important to be precise here: this isn’t about any single video or ideology. It’s about temporal control. A society that cannot easily keep records is trapped in the present tense. Always reacting, never contextualizing. History doesn’t disappear because it’s deleted. It disappears because everyone assumes someone else saved it. And that assumption is being engineered. submitted by /u/Key-Lawfulness-4885 to r/conspiracy [link] [comments]",

My suggestion is to mildy buff the conquering aspects of these, late game becoming rebellious, colonies, by just singificantly reducing or removing AE of conquring them. Then you'd still have to pay for the singificant integration cost but at least you don't get kneecapped of never being to absorb these provinces ever if you'd like to care about coalitions or AE late game (otherwise the game just ends up as a conquest simulator to go all in and war the coalitions to the end if you'd like to annex vast colonies, like i now mistakenly covered all of russia with.) submitted by /u/HampeMannen to r/EU5 [link] [comments]",

Here are some of the biggest lessons I learned the hard way: – Making games is hard. Not just technically, but emotionally and mentally too. – The first version will be bad, and that’s normal. – Players don’t think like developers do. – Wishlists will become your obsession. – You’ll often question whether it’s worth it. I’m curious: if you’ve worked on a game for a while, what’s something you only realized after months or years of development? submitted by /u/Giuli_StudioPizza [link] [comments]",

The dev mode options has this, but you have to constantly reapply it because the added moisture declines over time. Also, perhaps controversial, but I want a boost to early tech. There one mod that exists for this only boosts tech for universities, which can take a long time to get to. Yes I know these are mostly cheats.

I would compare him to Tre Mann. 30pts, 7/13 FG's, 4/8 from 3, 3 rebs, 4 ast, 1to, 2 stls. I already had the 6'4 190lb. CG Trent Perry in my top60 before this game and I bumped him up a few spots afterwards. right now he's sitting at #53 on my board but he seems primed to rise further and close this season out with a bang, and UCLA sure needs him with Dent shooting 9% from 3(not a typo!) submitted by /u/FatsBelvedere to r/NBA_Draft [link] [comments]",
