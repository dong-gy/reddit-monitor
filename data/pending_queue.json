Having it show up late game and be worth ~18 bucks just for playing the game normally doesn't make sense. 1 money per icon period actually wouldn't be bad because that's still a good chunk of money+appeal for the usual passive effect. Buff: Expert in Europe - This guy needs some help.

      "content": "I've been wondering about the performance difference in games where enemies are constantly creating and destroying instances of their state classes, versus an approach where enemies cache their state and simply reset the values when jumping back to a previously used state. I haven't tested it myself since I'm very new at all this and haven't really got the time at the moment, but my best guess is the former is more cpu intensive while the latter uses more ram. So as usual there isn't a \"best\" solution and it all depends on the needs of the game and its bottlenecks. Either way I'd like to read the opinions of experienced devs on the matter, maybe the caching is a bad idea, period, and the traditional way is always better, but due to recent performance-related issues with modded minecraft due to the garbage collector I'm inclined to think otherwise (or maybe that's just java and/or mimecraft's code jankiness). submitted by /u/Y-oshirin [link] [comments]",

I will list all the features the launcher offers: - Universal controller support - Unified gaming handheld like UI - You can add your games using the iOS Sharing sheet - It supports deep links for Delta Emulator ROMs and Provenance - You can also create your own custom iOS Shortcuts and map them in LudiHub - You can rename any game, change its shortcut to a custom one or even the icon image - You can create folders in the collection tab and organize your games - You can mark your favorite games and see them in the favorite tab - The bottom menu bar is also customizable. There is a FAQ page in the settings page, translated in all supported languages - There are six pre-built color themes that adapt to light and dark mode with optional animated backgrounds that match each color - You can also choose your own wallpaper and toggle between crystal clear and frosted/solid glass aesthetic - It come with two pre-built removable web shortcuts for GFN and Game Pass - The status pills on top offer information about your controller status and your device battery status - There is a 2-step tutorial built it to avoid the initial setup confusion - You can navigate entirely with a controller in LudiHub but can also use touch input if you like The App is Universal (iPhone and iPad), Family Sharing compatible and costs one time 3.99$ / 4,99€. No IAP, No Ads or Data collection. New features are added based on community feedback. The next version is already in development.

(If you happen to be curious about any of this check my profile here and find my twitter profile and you can see what my games are there) In this example I'm demonstrating death/destruction effects on enemies. This is in a test room with test objects around, so don't take it too seriously, but I always liked how swords cut enemies in half in mega man zero so I took that idea and ran with it. Blunt weapons can smash them into tiny pieces. Crunching up enemies should be intrinsically rewarding and that's what I'm hoping people find when they eventually play it. edit: I'm sharing because it helps stay motivated but I'm always open to feedback if anyone has any! submitted by /u/thedeadsuit [link] [comments]",

In that respect, for example, the Pixel, with its seven years of updates, is unbeatable. So, if you buy a OnePlus, it will work perfectly for many years (my OnePlus 7 still runs like a dream today), but after five years, you'll have a fantastic phone without updates or security patches, making it insecure and, for many people, useless. So, I don't understand the point of making these phones so great and then not providing better support for them. From 2027 onwards in Europe will be required that the battery be easily replaceable by the user, and I hope that Europe will also promote progress in the updates.

Madrid can perform upfront even without Vini , but we do lack calm and control in the middle, and that’s where Vitinha comes in as a player who keeps the ball moving, sets the rhythm, and makes everyone around him better. Moving Vini at this point would be ideal as we could reset the team’s balance, turning individual chaos into collective control, and using Vini’s price tag to fix the area Madrid now feel most exposed. submitted by /u/Oblongcashew to r/realmadrid [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Hi everyone, I've been working on a proof-of-concept web app that lets you play PICO-8 multiplayer games online with your friends. PICO-8 multiplayer games are designed for local play and you need everyone physically on the same keyboard or controllers. There is no native way to make online multiplayer games in Pico-8. How It Works With PICO Party, one person hosts a room and everyone else joins with a 4-letter room code. The host's browser runs the actual PICO-8 game and streams frames to all players via a peer-to-peer connection (WebRTC). Remote players see the game in real-time and their inputs are sent back to the host, where they're injected directly into the PICO-8 runtime as if everyone was pressing keys on the same machine. Will work even if users are on different networks. This means any PICO-8 game with multiplayer support works out of the box . No cartridge modifications needed if your game uses standard btn() calls with the default bindings. You can play multi-cart games and also use play any custom game as long as you have a link to the .p8.png url. Players can play on mobile with touch controls: a virtual D-pad and action buttons. Great for playing with friends who only have their phone. Try it at: https://picoparty.io Submit Your Games! The current library is pretty small. I've basically just been adding games I have been playing with my friends. If you've made a multiplayer PICO-8 game (or know of one that would work well as long as it is Creative Commons 4.0 or you have the author's permission), I'd love to add it to the library. Just open a PR at https://github.com/dwjiang/pico-party-games with: Cartridge URL (.p8.png) Game name, author, description Player count (min/max) A few screenshots Once the code is merged, the change should trigger a deployment and you should be able to see your game in the app within minutes. Future Feature Ideas If there is interest, I can continue to develop the app. Some ideas that I have: Audio streaming - Currently only video/frame data is streamed. Working on getting game audio to remote players too Public lobbies - Find random players to game with Cartridge discoverability - Allow users to sort by popular/newly added cartridges Saving progress - Saving cartdata so users can continue previous sessions. If there's a feature you'd want, let me know. Feedback Welcome I would love to hear what you think, any bugs you find, or games you'd like to see added.

I did it because I wanted to support the community — both on Wayfarer and in Pokémon GO — especially in smaller towns where there are very few PokéStops. I put a lot of effort into my submissions because I actually care about improving the game for other players. What I don’t understand is why people like me get punished for supposedly “small mistakes,” many of which I strongly disagree with or which are simply not true. In the end, you receive a negative mark, and all motivation is gone. It feels incredibly discouraging. What makes this even worse is that there are clearly people who ignore criteria completely, submit low-quality or abusive content, or otherwise misuse the system — and they often seem to be overlooked and not punished at all. That is extremely frustrating. Instead of focusing on those who clearly break the rules, the system seems to target players who genuinely try to help. Because of this experience, I’m honestly at the point where I don’t feel like doing anything for the community anymore. And that’s the real shame here: the people who put in the most effort to improve the game, especially in rural or smaller areas, are the ones being pushed away. I think this is something the Wayfarer community and Niantic really need to reflect on, because this approach drives away the very players who want to contribute positively. submitted by /u/ugartecard to r/NianticWayfarer [link] [comments]",

The game is a story-driven experience where you play as a character who is short on money and opens a small store with their savings. The store does not do well, things start falling apart, and one day a mysterious guy approaches and asks: \"Wanna be the guy?\" From there, your character gets involved in all sorts of shady and interesting activities. You clean up crimes, complete jobs, and eventually build your own empire. Unlike typical tycoon games, everything is scripted like a story-driven AAA title. Every action and event is part of a carefully crafted narrative. Here is the thing. So far, it mostly feels like a walking simulator. I really do not want that, so I would love suggestions for mechanics that make the gameplay engaging while keeping it story-driven. Thanks so much for any feedback. submitted by /u/Creepy-Ear-5303 [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Hey r/IndieDev ! My mobile CCG/TCG Elarion: Aetherfall launches this Sunday (Feb 1st) on iOS. I've been lurking here for a while getting inspired by everyone's progress posts. What I built: A tactical card game with priority-based combat. Unlike simultaneous reveal games, one player commits first (card revealed), then the opponent reacts knowing WHAT card but not HOW MUCH resource they're committing. Creates constant mind games. The journey: Started as a tribute to my fond memoried of playing the web based Urban Rivals growing up. Grew to 70+ characters Built deep lore for every character. Added ranked ladder, seasonal rewards, cosmetic marketplace Solo project Tech stack for the curious: iOS native (Swift/SwiftUI) Cloudflare Workers backend D1 database Real-time matchmaking At launch: 70+ characters (all free from start) 6 factions with unique clan bonuses 8-card decks, 2-4 min matches Cosmetic-only monetization 📱 Pre-order: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/elarion-aetherfall/id6754101666 2 days out. The excitement/terror ratio is roughly 50/50. Any other solo devs here launched competitive multiplayer games? How did the first week go? submitted by /u/Roberttee93 [link] [comments]",

The code conan originally received was in Japanese but in English it translate to this- \"I'm a major league slugger. This is the beginning of extended inning game...? It doesn't matter if you prepare a good stopper... I will turn around the game in the end...\" So here is conan deduction P1- Major league refers to a American baseball league. C1- The entire code must be decipher in English. P2- A good stopper in baseball refers to strong earned run average statistics or Era. C2- The abbreviation of earned run average is Era. P3- Extended innings game in baseball can also be called extra inning games. P4- If you remove Era from Extra it leaves XT. P5- if you put XT vertically and move 180 degree then it represent the Japanese Kanji 文. P6- Kanji 文 represent schools. C3- The bomb is in a school. Now, conan cuts the wire of the bomb in the elevator 3 second before it blast. It result in conan to not get the whole clue but the part of it which was EVIT(unlike the letter this was English even in original translation). P7- Evit turned around will come out as tive. C4- The whole word is actually detective with tive being it's last part. P8- Detective in Japanese is 探偵(Tantei) P9- Reversing 探偵(Tantei) gives you 偵探(Teitan). P10- There are school with teitan 偵探 in it. C5- Mixing P10 and C3 it comes out that the actual place of the bomb is teitan school. P11- There are 3 teitan schools. Elementary, middle and high school. P12- The culprit behind the bomb is targeting people in it attacks intentionally. P13- In winter only teitan high school is active cause of there exam. C6- The bomb is in Teitan high school. Tge reason why this deduction is so hard or good is cause there are no guesses, induction or abduction. Each step follow necessarily from the pervious. And it is also very hard as conan has to realise many thing during the deduction process like- \"MAJOR LEAGUER\" → TRANSLATE TO ENGLISH \"GOOD STOPPER\" → ERA → REMOVE FROM EXTRA → VISUAL ROTATION INTO KANJI \"EVIT\" ON A BOMB LCD PANEL → REVERSE DETECTIVE → JAPANESE REVERSAL → TEITAN And also conan was in extreme pressure while also psycoanalysing the bomber and he correctly deduced 2 separate cipher joining them flawlessly with a countdown.

      "content": "I'm making a Dungeon Crawler Rogue-Like using structure blocks, trial spawners, vaults, decorated pots and utilizing Loot Tables for all of my rewards found in the dungeon. But to actually make the game play like a Rogue-Like I'd love to have unlockable items. To my knowledge there's no way to modify a loot tables without going into the file and directly editing it. But if there is a way, that would be amazing. I had an idea to pull it off where if an item that isn't unlocked yet spawns, I can detect that and kill the entity and replace it with an unlocked item before the player picks it up. I'm not using Chests anywhere in the dungeon, so items will basically always exist as an entity at some point. But ideally, actually modifying the loot tables would be amazing. I'm not all the familiar with Loot Table Functions yet, I know how \"set_count\" works but that's kinda it. If a function could check an in-game Score, or something of the like, and then completely change the item, that would be awesome. Alternatively if it can't change what item it is, maybe it can change the other item data? Like enchantments, custom name, and custom attribute modifiers? That wouldn't be as good, but still really helpful. Thanks! submitted by /u/BenManGinger to r/MinecraftCommands [link] [comments]",

Now Loki isn't the broken per say, but his very existence makes these ultimates even worse to deal with \"Oh you're having trouble countering insert the OP support ult that comes with every season how about you do it twice!?\" Now for how I would fix this issue I must first put up an amazing example that just happened to me in a match. Friend is playing Loki and in overtime the enemy CnD ults. Now it would seem like the only option is to copy your other support and stall the game. Except....this genius bastard copies the enemy MAGNETO and takes out the CnD and their Bucky with his ultimate. Then proceeds to help our tanks push the other team away, winning us the match. Noe THIS! this is the type of playmaking you'de from a GOD OF MISCHIEF!! So to keep encouraging these type of plays, I would simply make it so the Loki's that copy ults from their tanks or dps get rewarded with stat buffs if they manage to get off a kill. Like: you double ult with your Punisher and manage to wipe away the Luna ult? Congrats now for 30 seconds you have increased damage and lowered cooldowns! Oh You copied your Strange and stunned and killed the diving Magik and Daredevil? now You have 200 overhealth and your runes get 100 more hp for 40 seconds! Oh you copied your strategist!??? you get nothing and your copied ult starts at 95% instead of the normal 100% I don't want to take away the option to just copy your other support, but instead i want to increase the value in making risky plays!

      "content": "Created an UpdatePartComponent step to begin to separate the physics update from the internal vehicle update logic. Moved RocketCore and RocketNozzle update logic from the physics loop to Rocket.UpdateRockets. Moved ResourceManager from RocketNozzle to RocketCore to increase the separation between core (internal) and nozzle (external) association. Added propellant mass flow rate to nozzle and core readouts. Fixed very excessive propellant usage due to a sign flip in the consumption logic. Created FxTemperature part component to drive emission and thin film intereference maps. For the moment, this is driven purely from nozzle temperatures. Added FxTemperature component to SubParts with models and components that support it. Removed ResetState() method from PartComponentStateful as it was no longer needed. Fixed a few bugs with higher order symmetrical editing, added a few bugs with higher order symmetrical editing. Swapping between symmetry orders with multiple layers of symmetry inheritence is still a bit touch and go. All in all, going in the right direction. Use PartComponent.TryGetFrom() in a few places where it's less verbose and updated some related doc comments. Added a method to get mutable access to part component states for serialization and UI-context modification. Fixed a case where part components would incorrectly think that they couldn't be updated, leading to emissive maps not working. Improved behavior of temperature emissivity sim, especially for engines at low throttle. Increased maximum temperature for thruster emissive by 1.75 times. Increased thruster emissive intensity. Merged Part and SubPart classes. This should allow us to simplify quite a bit of logic doubling. This is not meant change the player-facing functionality of Part vs SubPart in the game. Quite a bit of clean up is still needed and given the wide reaching changes unintentional regressions should be expected. Return individual TStates and TFxStates by reference instead of by value from PartComponentStateful.StateList. Added individual component and state getters to PartComponentStateful.StateUpdater to match the interface of PartComponentStateful.StateList. Moved the Tank processing from the old TankList to the new PartComponent/State system. Made hot path initialization for type updaters infallible to avoid the infectious complexity of null checking in the vehicle update task. Removed the isEditorUpdate flag for vehicle updates which no longer has a purpose. Created an InertMass part component and shifted readers to use that instead of the template. Added in missing part components from top-level parts. Removed unused PartTree.TotalSubstanceStorageVolume. Moved one last mass template reader over to the part component. Converted engine and thruster controllers into part components. Created a GetSubtreeComponents() function to iterate over all part components of a given type for a part and its sub parts. Fixed a few accessors in PartComponent.List which weren't returning the concrete component type correctly. Return sub parts as a span instead of a collection. Removed thruster/engine controller properties on PartTree. Converted the subtree components generator into a ref struct enumerator to avoid allocation and used it in an additional place. Removed some redundant code left over from tanks moving to part components. Moved some PartTree functionality out of the Part class into the PartTree class. Added a Split function to the PartTree class. Tightened access to the Parts list in PartTree so that it must go through PartTree functions so we can eliminate logic errors where other code outside this class could change the Parts list in the PartTree without performing other related logic in the PartTree. Changed the public Parts collection in PartTree to be a readonly span. Made the static part list on PartTree private. Marked two PartTree lists as readonly. Use GetSubtreeComponents() for inert mass display. Fixed some pipelines being mislabelled as 'Byte[]' Fixed potential issue in Physics IntegrateVelocityVerlet where mass properties were not set for initial state causing a mismatch between first derivatives and half-step derivatives. submitted by /u/panic_in_the_galaxy to r/kittenspaceagency [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Most people draw a line between pirating from \"The Big Guys\" vs. the \"Little Guys.\" It’s easy to justify downloading a file from a faceless, multi-billion dollar corporation, but it’s a lot harder when you’re looking at the actual human who spent years of their life—and likely their own savings—making it. If you were forced to have a conversation with an indie dev and admit you pirated their project, how would that talk go? Would you try to justify it, or would you realize there isn't much of a defense when the person who's \"out of pocket\" is standing right in front of you? Does the \"morality\" of piracy change for you when the developer is just one person instead of a CEO? submitted by /u/YesterdayEven5265 to r/PiratedGames [link] [comments]",

En especial con noticias recientes de que hasta parches están dañando SSDs y la situación de seguridad y vibe coding en Microsoft está terrible. La vara es que yo uso mi compu 99% para gaming. Tengo un setup relativamente high end. De hecho ya tengo una pequeña partición de Ubuntu que uso para varas de desarrollo y tengo un boot manager que hace default en Windows. Quiero consejos para migración...cual distro es buena para gaming? Cómo está la compatibilidad (juego principalmente en Steam pero también tengo algunos juegos retro en GOG) con Proton? Uno puede usar Proton para juegos que no son de Steam? Tengo entendido que jugar en linea es casi que imposible. Solo jugaba BF6 pero ya casi no, y siento que para eso puedo preservar una partición de Windows. Lo que quiero saber es si es posible \"invertir\" mi configuración de discos duros sin borrar muchas cosas. O sea, en vez de 500 gb de Ubuntu y 5tb de Windows, hacer 5tb de Ubuntu, eso puedo hacerlo o tengo que volarme las 2 instalaciones?

However when trying to move the camera around the viewport I noticed that it gets stuck moving in one direction when I press the key a bit longer. It seems that it \"caches\" the input and keeps using it to move. When I release the mouse button and select any kind of text field, the cached characters get immediately pasted there and the issue disappears until I try to do more stuff in viewport and the whole scenario repeats. It makes any learning almost impossible and really frustrating, as - for example - I cannot press a key to change transform if there is already some input stored. Have you seen this before? Do you know how can I fix this? The issue can be seen in this video . I have released the W key around 2nd second of the recording and kept moving with only RMB held. At the end you can see that \"wwwww\" was pasted into the text field at the bottom just as I selected it.

There is currently a petition going to reverse this, so that people have to consciously turn off their filters to see anything suggestive or adult oriented.

I read that the deadline has been extended to June 30, 2026, and that the work submitted in 2024 shouldn't have been carried over to the 2026 edition. However, when I opened my gradebook, I noticed that it also marked the 2024 work as valid submissions. Is this a bug? Or does it mean that the work completed in 2024 is also valid and doesn't need to be resubmitted? I know that learning is what matters, but honestly, in a difficult moment in my life, I'd like to be able to hold a concrete result in my hands as proof of my efforts, even if it's just a certificate.

It's got the standard 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi (no 5 GHz listed, which is interesting) and the label diagrams seem to show a top-loading dustbin, which would be a nice little convenience. Based on the 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi, I'm guessing this might be a new Q-series refresh or a mid-tier model rather than a new flagship S-series.

More about the game: Hundred Nights DIFU is a Chinese hell management simulation indie game where you get to manage how souls live in their afterlife. At its core, it has a lot of humor, some sense of cozyness, and a pure build & management gameplay. We take some gameplay inspirations from Two Point series, Prison Architect, and even Dyson Sphere Program. We are a small indie team of friends who share the same passion for game dev and simulation games. The game is still way too early in development stage but we do hope steam page and playtest will be up within this year (follow me for more updates!). So, what do you think of the capsule art we are preparing? 1 or 2 and why? If you have other ideas/feedbacks, please let us know!

Videći da su RAM cene otišle u kurac i moj trenutni laptop koji sam uzeo prošle godine (R5 6600H, RTX 3050, 16GB DDR5) dosta koči u većim projektima, mislio sam da uzmem upgrade. Razmišljao sam da uzmem Macbook Pro M4, sa pro M4 čipom, 512/24, našao sam neki od 2050e na KP. Pošto macbook apsolutno nije upgradable, mislio sam da se fokusiram na pro čip i više rama a za storage da uzmem barem neki eksterni SSD kasnije. Laptop koristim kao sekundarni/poslovni uređaj, imam računar kod kuće. Voleo bi takođe savete koje alate da koristim. Kontekst, radim game dev samostalno (Godot, Blender, FL Studio, itd) a u firmi radim C++ (Visual Studio), ponekad kotlin/javu (Gradle) pa me zanima da li ima neke razlike u alatima koje se koriste?

I've created a health component that handles health given/taken and death, and a health interface to handle communicating between characters. Basic stuff. I implemented the interface on the health component itself instead of on the characters. The idea being that any character I add the component to will already have the interface implemented. It works great, but (and maybe I'm over thinking this..) it feels slightly wrong somehow. In order to apply damage to a character, I need to [get components by interface] because the target implementing the interface is the health component of the character, not the character itself. Example in the comments as I couldn't add an image here. So basically my question is, does using the [get components by interface] function defeat the purpose of using the interface? submitted by /u/ShmodyP [link] [comments]",

How hard would it even be to make Magik’s aura purple to match the punk skin instead of always staying yellow? The natural colors of abilities used clash a lot and don’t match some of the coolest skins. If screen clutter is really a problem, why not make the vfx for normal abilities only visible to the player? make iron fist’s fist a different color sometimes. The green looks mad weird with some of his coolest skins. Or have the Phoenix primary stack explosion have ice visual.

As someone who is trying to get into the industry and having worked on short films, I can only imagine the amount of work this took. Hearing about it all on Distractiable and through videos doesn't compare to going through it and with the behind the scenes coming out, we all can tell how much love and creativity went into this. Audiences know when you've put in the work and you've tried your best for a project you love. The sound design, art, costuming, vfx, lightning- everything about it made me feel what I feel for movies when I was growing up. Real sets, seeing an actor engage with real props and the hard thing of writing something surrounding \"one location\". Really cool stuff. It's really inspiring seeing someone go from playing video games at their desk to making a feature length film, especially one that's self funded and is backed with so many people who support it. Just thought I would put it out there that this has really inspired me to go for things and make them happen. I loved the film and hope others also feel that spark of inspiration. submitted by /u/FijianGecko to r/Markiplier [link] [comments]",

Even if making other items obsolete is the reason I dislike finch wings so much, this time it feels warranted because of the absolute grip hermes boots had on accessory builds all the time.

It didn’t turn out exactly how I imagined at the start, and I definitely ran into my own limits as a developer, but I’m okay with that. Maybe I’ll come back to it someday and see what I can improve.

Close to nill. We have tested for colorblindness, non-issue. We can match colors, put the red ones here (if we have a red one there). If we ask, where is the red one, he guesses every time, this applies to all colors. Sometimes working with letters, and given 3 choices, he will get them right... For instance which starts with g... \"Green\" and point to it. He knows black, and white, sometimes brown. Other than that, he pretty much never gets it right and instantly guesses a wrong color. Without questioning he would say \"pink!\" or \"the red light\" or \"blue and red make purple\" Any suggestions? Am I just over thinking it? I feel like he should know them by now. Chatgpt suggested working on just red, which we have been doing for a week and I still feel if I asked him what color \"some red object\" is, he'd get it wrong. submitted by /u/ctarb to r/homeschool [link] [comments]",

This works perfect. Once I realized I could do this, I stopped having exhibits crammed with tree frogs and everything made sens. But then we go over to habitats. How am I supposed to do this? I want to expand my zoo, but I have exhibits where there are way too many animals, but I can't sell them or release them because they're almost all new babies. I can only put them in the trading post, so the trading post is clogged with animals. I can put the animals on contraceptives, but then they all die out unless I'm paying really close attention and then I have empty habitats. Even if I don't put ALL the animals on contraceptives. Is this it? Is this the game? Just monitoring the breeding of your zoo and trying to balance the population? Cause I can't do anything else without the game giving me warnings that there's overcrowding or alphas fighting for dominance every two minutes. Why isn't there some kind of a function for habitat population the way there is for exhibits? This is making me not want to play. submitted by /u/plastic-stardust to r/PlanetZoo [link] [comments]",

The scholarship and total debt I would be taking on is about the same at both. I'm from the northeast and have no problem settling in PA/Philly long term. I am currently leaning towards Temple due to its location in Philadelphia and its slightly higher ranking/reputation. Since I would already be living in the city for school, I imagine it will be easier to network and secure summer internships/work in Philly, and I know that Temple has great connections in the city. But there are things that make Penn State attractive (a major university, an extensive alumni network, a more secluded location to focus, and, to be completely honest, football/basketball games/being a BIG10 school). I know both are pretty close in the rankings (#50 v. #59), but University Park is kind of the “second campus” for Penn State. I am planning to visit both soon, but this sub has been a great resource throughout my process, and I would appreciate any input or thoughts! submitted by /u/Icy_Tourist6609 to r/OutsideT14lawschools [link] [comments]",

It is a roguelite with soulslike inspired combat, where you will play as a knight, an archer and a mage, each with their skills, strengths and weaknesses. My ideia for an engaging combat is to apply some rules I personally learned from playing some souls games, like no cancellation animation, stamina management, lock-on on enemies, well-timed parries, dodges and skill activations. In the efforts to make the combat work with multiple enemies, it ended up with some free flow flavor.

Other method I saw was duplicating the asset, flipping it and using a shader to turn it into a shadow so they can rotate it for a day cycle but that seems rather complex to make it look good.

For both simplicity and immersion these capsules were made with IN-GAME graphics , with this I mean I created scenes in-game (unaccessible to the player) and these are screenshots of those scenes, this way I just had to crop them. I tried Following Online Guidelines for capsules and library heroes, had to redraw Scenes multiple times to make the text more readable and fit Steam's Ratio . Took me a couple of days to get them like this and I think it highlights the lighting of the game itself.

The sprite is y-billboarded towards the camera. Because the game is viewed from a top-down angle, I drew the sprites in that manner. However, for animations like the one pictured (walking south), the feet moving forward in space is visually represented by the pixels being drawn lower on the sprite, which makes them clip through the ground. https://preview.redd.it/rh5fcr2dnjgg1.png?width=292&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ff2c9fbec530d301621d42689ce7adba0461219 In this picture, I show this clipping along the edge of a floor, so you can see both the sprite clipping through the floor and the edge of the floor revealing the underside of the sprite. I need to find a way to allow the part of the sprite that clips under the floor to still be visible, without causing the sprite to become visible through other objects that SHOULD block the view, like walls. For a while, my solution was to make the sprite be offset towards the camera equally along the Y and Z axes, which wouldn't appear in the camera view, but long-term, I think this workaround could still come back to bite me, like if I wanted to ever include proper shadows and lighting, it would reveal that the sprite is hovering. https://preview.redd.it/8mm8ke7rnjgg1.png?width=384&format=png&auto=webp&s=313703c9fb49b406ebec97802186646db39001a2 https://preview.redd.it/eqbsyygrnjgg1.png?width=687&format=png&auto=webp&s=a5ba5be8a84cd85bf12c3c7a8a862eb05f9645db Pictured above are screenshots of the full 128x128 character pixel canvas being filled with a test texture so you can see the extent of the sprite canvas on the AnimatedSprite3D, as well as what the player object looks like in the engine viewport.

The silence was uncomfortable, but it was honest. Saying what was expected would have meant setting aside something I wasn’t ready to dismiss. Eventually, the conversation moved on without the reassurance I would usually give. Nothing exploded. Nothing broke. What stayed with me was realizing how often I trade honesty for harmony without even noticing.

I have an incredibly helpful husband but he goes in to weekend flow mode because that’s what he knows. He’s been home the last 10 weeks with me and new baby. The magic of Christmas and making memories is down to me as mom. It all feels a little intimidating realizing that it feels like I always have to be a step ahead, on my A Game , getting up early, and planning ahead to be a good present mom who has the time play with my two little kids. It’s a constant crazy balancing act and if I’m not always on and going the systems fall apart. How are other moms handling this?? For reference we live in a very small old space and we cloth diaper and cloth paper towels to save money, no paper plates.

      "content": "I’m looking to get a fitting at club champion (due to gift card there specifically). Initially I was only planning to use the driver fitting in order to get shaft specs that fit my swing more. The current promo lets you use the fitting price as a credit towards a club. I have 3 year old fitted irons currently, but feel like I would benefit from a fitting as my handicap has dropped from a ~18 > 9 at this point. I’ve never had a driver/wood, hybrid, wedge, or putter fitting. The gift card I have is $180, enough for a driver fitting without the promotional sale ($50 if buying a custom club). The fitting price for a full bag, with the purchase of a new club, is $100. An idea I had was the use this promotional period to get a full bag fitting for “cheap”, and then use my $180 gift card to buy the cheapest club that would make me qualify for the promo. So my question to the community is, how much do you think the cheapest custom club purchase would be? I’ve read that they have all those extra costly fees like the build fee and the “puring” fee. I’m just trying to weigh the difference in pricing and whether to just use the gift card for a normal driver fitting without the discount and paying for a club, or taking advantage of the full bag fitting opportunity. TLDR- what’s the cheapest custom club purchase that I can make at club champion in order to take advantage of the full bag fitting promotion for $100 submitted by /u/Solid-Drop-2780 to r/golf [link] [comments]",

I know Mikan feels like she would be a waste of a survivor slot so if they were thinking of making her a survivor, I feel like they might have to make her more useful throughout the game and build more confidence for herself throughout the trials and potentially help our protagonist out as like a support of sorts In summary: Im PRAYING for mikan being a survivor but something is telling she might be a victim. leaning towards Survivor Most upvoted character gets to be talked about tomorrow Make your predictions for Mikan, too if you so please. submitted by /u/OneDragonfruit8042 to r/DanganAndChaos [link] [comments]",

I've seen games with many more features that are only around 3-5 MB. Also, I can't use the library optimizer because I can't use Gradle (if you ask, I only used 8 ARM, and my game's APK is 25 MB). My game code is only 99 lines long, and I only use 2D; I didn't use a character body in the project.

A lot of speculation has surfaced about this ending, such as you needing a perfect performance to complete (or the complete opposite, a terrible performance), attempting to romance Malevola, or aceing every single hacking sequence (including the optional ones). I was wondering if anyone had tried just not choosing any responses when you're able? Not sure if anyone knew this, but if you let the decision timer run out, it just picks a decision for you, and though I haven't tested it, I think it might be possible this isn't random, which leads me to think a possible way to get the ending is literally do nothing.

      "content": "In the mid-long term future, I plan to leave my job in a western studio and start a western-style indie PC games studio in Asia. Not sure what's a best investment until then, learning Chinese or Japanese (traveled to both). As for China: Future stability . Risk of war/economical-visa restrictions/ possible VPN law changes for the Great Firewall. Easier chinese visas, less starting capital required. Harder to get visa-free residency. But Japan's future leans right-wing and anti immigration. Content restrictions are only an issue if selling to the Chinese market (same restrictions for a company in the west selling to Chinese citizens). Much easier to hire/fire talent in China (bigger talent pool, applicants more open to small remote-first studios, lower cost of life/salaries, much much easier to fire a bad hire that would kill the company in a small japanese bootstrapped indie project). Japan talent pool has a worse demographic future. Worse opportunities for outside investment for games. I'm planning to bootstrap with savings, but don't want to close doors to future investment. Chinese publishers invest first in mobile/multiplayer (at least now), not my focus. Western publishers avoid Chinese companies due to worse intellectual property/legal protections. This is usually handled by keeping intellectual property and cash in an empty US Holding Company that outsources development to the Chinese one, but might be too much friction/risk for western investors. China is worse for selling the company. For a western publisher looking to acquire, even if the intellectual property is in the US holding company, it seems like a risk to buy a Chinese dev team that can go dark with a VPN law change. Long-term life/culture. China feels easier to integrate into. Prefer the bustle and hustle rather than the japanese zen with slow grind. Immigrants in Japan struggle to feel \"accepted\". Should I learn Chinese or Japanese during these previous years? China looks better for bootstrapped indies and lifestyle, Japan better for established/publisher focused big companies. submitted by /u/SavingClippy to r/AskAChinese [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Hey everyone! I'm trying to create a compositor effect in 4.5 that processes the color buffer based on stencil buffer values (doing custom highlight and outline effects). I've followed the 'The Compositor' tutorial in the docs, and got things set up the color buffer. So for the next step I've tried to add the depth buffer(1.) and it isn't going well. I thought I could follow the same pattern as using the color buffer in my shader. So in the glsl code I declare my buffer uniforms like so: layout(rgba16f, binding = 0, set = 0) uniform image2D color_tex; layout(rgba16f, binding = 1, set = 0) uniform image2D depth_tex; And in the script I fetch the buffers create uniforms/set as follows: var color_buffer = render_scene_buffers.get_color_layer(view) var color_uniform: RDUniform = RDUniform.new() color_uniform.uniform_type = RenderingDevice.UNIFORM_TYPE_IMAGE color_uniform.binding = 0 color_uniform.add_id(color_buffer) var depth_buffer = render_scene_buffers.get_depth_layer(view) var depth_uniform: RDUniform = RDUniform.new() depth_uniform.uniform_type = RenderingDevice.UNIFORM_TYPE_IMAGE depth_uniform.binding = 1 depth_uniform.add_id(depth_buffer) var uniform_set = UniformSetCacheRD.get_cache(shader, 0, [ color_uniform, depth_uniform ]) The shader compiles just fine. But when I run the script I get a few errors repeating every frame, the first one being ERROR: Image (binding: 1, index 0) needs the TEXTURE_USAGE_STORAGE_BIT usage flag set in order to be used as uniform. Now I'm not sure why I get this error for the depth buffer uniform and not the color buffer. I tried bitwise or'ing the TEXTURE_USAGE_STORAGE_BIT (so depth_uniform.uniform_type = RenderingDevice.UNIFORM_TYPE_IMAGE | TEXTURE_USAGE_STORAGE_BIT ), but that gave me an error stating that the uniform_type value was out of bounds. So I'm not really sure where I am going wrong. Clearly I am misunderstanding something.

SFA is constantly insulting me and my intellect, so is the post-burn timeline which never should have picked up in another series. I see 2 options: either we come together and pull off some kind of blitzkrieg legal battle, which eventually forces Paramount (or whichever subsidiary is on charge right now) to never release another episode of that clusterfuck of emotional molestation. This might be hard to do, given the fact that they already dared to release 4 episodes, with a fifth one due for next week. Even if we hire the most slaughter-ready lawyers it might be to late to make them stop. The other more sane, more effective option would be to have someone on the inside who identifies all digital copies, production files and master images of that show and make them go away without a chance of restoration. This would need some kind of administrative access, and of course a person with lots of honor and selflessness. There are times when people are implored to act by their fellow civil brothers and sisters. This time is now. Only Paramount superusers can stop the destruction of our franchise. Yes if we delete all SFA copies now, there’d be still the 4 episodes floating around but they can always be considered to be a tragic example of selfish corporate media frenzy, an attack on fandom itself. We can’t tolerate NuTrek anymore. Sue or delete, what it’s gonna be? submitted by /u/Thizzor to r/trektalk [link] [comments]",

I'm developing a psychological game in the Pixel Art style, and I'm careful to ensure my project is religiously permissible. I've removed the eyes from the characters and I don't use rhythmic music; I only use sound effects or ambience. My question is: Is this type of art and sound permissible according to Islamic law?

Not mechanically but I am going to delve into some pretty reprehensible topics. Vile darkness etc.... I always ask players to let me know what is off limits. I do not wish to make people uncomfortable as I have very few limits myself. Most my players are the limit. I have no issues with really abhorrent things if it's done for the right reasons and not just shock value (Though sometimes that is a good thing). I find myself running into too many players saying they have no limits then going. HEY! That's too far!. It's too far I get it. We won't pursue this. Why did you not tell me this before? It would not have come up? Does anyone else have this problem? I run games about violence and its consequences among other such things such as power dynamics. This shit is dark and I refuse to glorify it. Why can't people just be honest? So many problems can be avoided. I am not talking about the really obviously avoided things. It's the smaller stuff that is setting them off. Players if you have a problem with a topic and the GM and you are asked PLEASE be honest and say so that way it does not come up. I am not a fan of X-Cards or even doing these kinds of checks ins since people lie but I don't know what to do at this point. No one seems to have a problem until they do. When asked \"Why didn't you say I would have happily avoided it?\" They go this shit is disturbing why would you go there and I am like I am using it BECAUSE it's disturbing. I want to face this. All of my writing is very personal and my last game I wrote essentially consisted of a me writing about coping with suicidal ideation and moving through it and never say those words but the professional health workers I played with picked up on it immediately. Tell the DM if you can't handle the topic. Don't lie and say you can. Please... I know some times we thinkwe can but discover we cannot but I have heard too many times now.

Bonus points for making her relevant in the NEXT patch, thus making this argument kind of obsolete. What if they randomly decided to give Vivian a swimsuit skin in OCTOBER, but NOT Miyabi, who as an ice character would (probably) be able to resist the cold. Bonus points if they acknowledge the fact that it was weird for them to do that since it was no longer summer time. What if they gave literal NPCs, characters that you literally CAN'T PLAY AS and thus won't be able to see as much, a skin, but NOT the VERY playable Hoshimi Miyabi. Bonus for giving them to NPCs that are actually popular, which would give this point less traction. What if they gave PAN FUCKING YINHU, a character who probably has like 5 fans, a skin, but NOT Miyabi, who is one of if not the MOST popular character in the game.

Australium Weapons are reskins of weapons to look like solid gold (technically Australium but it looks like gold.), and needles to say they look extremely cool. How would you get one you ask? You have to pay money to play Mann vs. Machine (the normal version is free, but you have to pay to get into the mode that gives you the Australium weapons.) to sign up for a tour, which are made up of several 30 or 40 minute missions that can take hours, and complete the tour without being votekicked by the notoriously toxic community. All for at best a 5% chance per TOUR to get an Australium Weapon. Yareli (Warframe). Yareli was a Warframe in the game that while not necessarily optimal, was very fashionable and unique. How do you get it? By completing an hours long quest line requiring you to perform extremly difficult tricks on a K-Drive, a rather Niche mechanic that (up until then), no one had any reason to use. I heard that it was made much easier, but I still will never get back the hours I spent on that quest. Characters in any any HoyoVerse game. The characters in all hoyoverse games often have very unique character designs, backstories, and great voice actors. However, to get these characters you either have to spend absurd amounts of money, or grind the most tedious, insanity inducing tasks for weeks on end to save up enough of whatever in-game currency to get any reasonable chance of getting ONE character. This is completely ignoring all the things you have to do to make the character optimal, which requires more grinding and oftentimes spending even more on gacha to get the character's weapons and other characters for good team composition. submitted by /u/WHATISREDDIT7890 to r/TopCharacterTropes [link] [comments]",

On top of that, a lot of Taobao or Alibaba links either bug out or don’t show up at all, and even tracking and QC pics have been hit or miss. It’s getting pretty frustrating to deal with. I decided to try Hipobuy after their recent site update, and it’s actually way more convenient than I expected. You can use cnfans links directly on Hipobuy without converting them, and cnfans spreadsheets seem to work fine too. The whole site just feels smoother and more reliable overall. They also brought back 30% off shipping coupons, which is nice. On top of that, if you forward your packages from the cnfans warehouse to Hipobuy, they pay for your domestic shipping, which is kind of crazy. I haven’t really seen another agent offer something like that before. With all the issues going on with cnfans, switching to Hipobuy honestly feels like the logical move at this point.

The way I finally got the deal was through Nord's special promo page. NordVPN holiday sale is running with upto 75% savings. 😊 I ended up using NordVPN's this specific promo page That’s where the discount code was actually applied automatically Up to 75% off on long-term plans for global 🌏 4 extra months free on the 2-year plan Access to all features It includes 30 day money back guarantee as a free trial Here's how you can get 30 day free trial Sign up through the promo link. Use NordVPN normally for up to 30 days. If you don’t want to keep it, just request a refund & they process it without hassle. That’s how people are getting both the lowest price and a risk free trial. I wasn’t sure at first, but I tried it myself and it worked fine. Important Note: Skip “coupon code” sites. Most of them are just sharing expired or fake codes to get clicks. The only working deal is through Nord’s official promo page. submitted by /u/InnerAd9283 to r/WorkingCouponAndPromo [link] [comments]",

This also allows them to leave the dark world and enter different ones without turning to stone, and it works like yinyang, the knight is yin, and ralsei is yang (alot of people make the mistakr of thinking that yin is the white).

      "content": "Some time ago I brought my plan for a Pokémon Fanfic, and I'm here to talk about another topic. I'll leave the link to the post for you to read. This time I want to say that I intend to adapt the two Pokémon Legends games, and I wanted to show my proposals. Legends Arceus: The story will tell the origin of the Fujiwara Family, and of the one who started it all, Christopher Fujiwara. He was a character of unknown origin who was chosen by Arceus and as a bonus received a natural gift for Aura, something that his descendants would inherit and improve. And in the future it is revealed that Christopher married Akari. Legends ZA: This one is still in the planning phase, but the biggest difference is that the game will take place 20 to 25 years after XY, to show my characters older, married and with children, including my OCs, and the protagonists being precisely those children. But it's also an idea that I might apply to the Tenth Region, but that may depend a lot on how it turns out. Soon I intend to make a post talking about the love interests of my OCs, but for now I would like to know what you thought of these ideas for the Legends Saga. submitted by /u/UsualWishbone4416 to r/pokemonfanfiction [link] [comments]",

      "content": "About three years ago I was making a music video and found I really liked environmental storytelling and world building. I decided my next project would be a video game. Since I already had quite a bit of experience in Blender and virtually none in any game engines I decided I’d figure out a development approach that lets me do most of the heavy-lifting in Blender. That’s how I ended up with a game that is 90% pre-rendered. The overworld backgrounds, the cutscenes and even the turn-based combat is all pre-rendered. It’s a bit of a nightmare to work with at times but I’m really happy with the result. The way I’d describe the game itself is a mix of Disco Elysium, Fear and Hunger, Look Outside and Bioshock. For the Disco Elysium inspiration, I wanted to create a world that felt truly lived-in with lively dynamic characters who are shaped by the world they inhabit. It also has a similar system for handling skill checks and there being multiple solutions to quests. For Fear and Hunger and Look Outside, this is the exploration, scavenging and combat elements of the game. I was especially inspired by the unique encounter design in Look Outside. Bioshock is a huge inspiration for the setting. I’ve wanted more games set in doomed underwater cities so I decided to go out and make my own. Hoping to release it in 2026 on Steam! submitted by /u/staticbetweenstation [link] [comments]",

Here's the question: How do you change gravity vector of a CharacterBody3D? I know that RigidBody3D can do so via collision with Area3D, but I want to make it independent , so I can stick my character to any wall I want. I thought about this kind of a solution: When change-gravity-button is pressed, a collision sphere gets first collision and its normal and sends it to gravity component, where it then interpolates character global position to collision point global position, counts difference between floor and character in angles and rotates it so player is perpendicular to the floor, and whenever we change walking surface the algorithm repeats submitted by /u/murdered_ronin [link] [comments]",

      "content": "I had an experience in Warzone that honestly crossed a line for me, and I think this is something the developers need to look at from a design perspective. A player used the hostage/carry mechanic in a way that visually resembled a sexual assault scenario, undeniably. I know the intent of the mechanic is tactical and gameplay-driven, but the way character models animate and how players can position themselves makes it very easy for someone to create something that looks extremely disturbing and inappropriate. Player downed me, took me hostage and took me to the corner of the wall simulating rape action. It triggered my PTSD! This isn’t about trash talk or normal toxicity — this is about how a gameplay animation can be misused to simulate something horrific. It caught me off guard and genuinely made me uncomfortable. I’m not blaming the game for player behavior, but I do think this is an unintended visual outcome of the mechanic that should be reviewed. Small animation or positioning restrictions could prevent this from happening without affecting gameplay. Has anyone else seen this? And how can we get this in front of the devs so they can adjust the mechanic? I’ve reported the player, but I think this is a design oversight that deserves attention. submitted by /u/Aggressive_Bill_2822 to r/Warzone [link] [comments]",

      "content": "I reached the part of the story where you and Hans arrive at Nebakov, and the moment the game auto saves I go on a MASSIVE killing spree and wipe out everyone at the fortress — as one usually do once you save! Funnily enough, doing so spoiled a big twist in the story: those guys were bandits and captured the real Jaromier! With everyone dead, I’m free to roam about and find all the clues like how they have weapons and armor stocked and even a Leipa shield (so they must be the same bandits who ambushed us at the start?), and you even get to chat with Jaromier in the dungeons to learn the full story. I feel like I accidentally advanced the plot by a couple hours and I noticed the killing spree will take a huge toll on your reputation: it makes no sense because those are bandits! And even after you wipe out everyone and returned to Trosky, you still have to go back and attack the fortress…..even though I already killed everyone? TLDR — I guess the devs never expected players to go on killing sprees that uncovers a secret. It kind of messed up the narrative, so what’s the “intended” way I’m supposed to go about this? submitted by /u/MaguroSashimi8864 to r/kingdomcome [link] [comments]",

Anyone got cool name ideas for them? submitted by /u/SoUlFaThEr [link] [comments]",

I currently work with Unity, have done some VR-related projects, and I also use Blender for 3D. I really enjoy game development and want to know the reality of the industry in India. I’d appreciate honest answers on: • How is the mobile game development market right now in India? • How are junior / fresher developers treated? • What do companies actually expect from freshers? • Is this a stable career in the long term? • Is VR experience useful or should I focus more on mobile games? I don’t have friends in this field, so insights from professionals would really help. Thanks in advance! submitted by /u/AlternativeWar3991 [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Hi everyone. I’ve been working for quite a while on a platform called Homespace ( https://store.steampowered.com/app/2508170/Homespace/ ). The core idea is that players build virtual homes and then play mini-games inside them. Recently, I decided to make a key focus of the project the idea that Unreal Engine developers could create their own mini-games, publish them, and sell them within our platform. It seems to me that creating mini-games is much easier than developing full-fledged games — even small indie ones — and if we already have an audience, this could be a very low-barrier entry point for developers. Moreover, we could provide an additional source of income for level and mini-game creators. And on a broader level, even if hardcore Unreal developers aren’t particularly interested, we’d still be lowering the entry barrier to game development for regular users — encouraging them to start experimenting with Unreal and even coding if they want to do so within our ecosystem. What do you think about this idea? Am I right in this assumption, and does it make sense to implement something like this at all? submitted by /u/General-Lock-1079 [link] [comments]",

Right now, it’s hard to build any plan tactics with club members. Adding a dedicated chat space would help players mentor each other and stay active.

If a Magician is shot while deflecting, the bullet will be deflected back at the shooter and deal damage! This makes it great for deterring the aggressive playstyle of the Mule, and can create strong opportunities to get a free reload off when down in the count. I'm super excited to keep showing off more of the game when the time is right. I've put a lot of heart into this game, so I want to make sure I give it a proper launch. 😁 Let me know if you have any other class ideas you think would be cool to see in game! submitted by /u/Calm_Salamander_2447 to r/rblxoutlaws [link] [comments]",

You're also incredibly lazy. You've done nothing for the game, and your newest additions are incredibly sloppy(like Riparia). Now, I'm not saying Riparia isn't pretty, the coding is just a s*** fest. It's a horrible map in that regard. I avoid it. Your modding community has shown more love and care for the game than you do. You just rake in the money and let them make the game for you. You should be ashamed of yourselves. Genuinely consider giving the game to the modding community. You clearly have done so in a less literal sense. You take suggestions(which are insanely easy to code and take little to no effort), and put them \"under consideration\" for years. It's depressing. Please get your s*** together. I've never had this many issues with a game in my LIFE. Not even THE SIMS 2 ON A MODERN PC has given me this many issues. It's easier to reinstall the Sims 2 from the ground up than to run POT. I'm genuinely angry because they're making it hard for me to keep liking the game. I love this game, but they're about on par with the Overwatch Devs right now. submitted by /u/CaughtClown to r/pathoftitans [link] [comments]",

I assume it is a Godot issue though as this does not happen with other applications. submitted by /u/Joniprog [link] [comments]",

I wanted to give a decent reason to explore and fight different monsters (besides filling the bestiary), what better way than rare card collecting? Now you will want to kill everything for miles. For the card game, I used opposing and matching elements instead of numbers. There's also a round element, and whoever has the most of that element's icon on the board at the end of the round gets a bonus. Tried to make it as self-explanatory as I could while still providing multiple avenues for points and victories.

I needed to destroy the object but to leave the PS for all of the particles to die beforehand. I tried destroying the model first, and then particle system, however it was not possible because while trying to destroy the children of cloned object I got an error telling me that I am trying do destroy prefabs. But doing so with the parent object (which was instantiated) works. I tried unparenting the PS as the tutorial showed, using transform.parent = null. But the error popped up saying the parrent cannot be null. I will try to just make two separate objects one with model and one with particle system and instantiate them. But it feels a bit clanky? Is there any other solution and am I missing something? Thanks in advance :) P.s.

In the winter, instead of the power station, I connect the LED lights directly to the truck’s starter battery using an always-hot cigarette outlet that I installed in the truck bed. With this setup, I’m not getting any power to the lights, and I’m not sure why. I know the cigarette outlet itself works because I use it to charge my portable power station. That makes me think the issue is either: • a voltage incompatibility, or. • the cable I’m using to connect the LED lights to the outlet. The LEDs are connected using a 5.5 × 2.1 mm (5521) to male cigarette lighter cable. This cable works in other setups and outlets, but I’m wondering if there’s something about this specific outlet, connection, or voltage that’s preventing the lights from powering on.

Took me awhile, but I'm quite happy with how they turned out. They are both low level and equipped with gear from the early game that I believe some Vermundian Soldiers use, but it's all fully upgraded so they should be able to handle even Battahl and Volcanic Island given the chance. Here are their \"specs\": ---- -Vernia Female Figther (level 21) Calm Inclination Skills: Burst Strike, Cloudward Slash, Hindsight Sweep, Full Moon Slash ID: 7RHJ1Z18M2H4 ---- -Baenlin Male Mage (level 20) Kindhearted Inclination Skills: High Halidom, High Celerity, High Palladium, Lightning Affinity ID: JLC5D7QYUXX4 (Vermundian mages usually only cast Flagration and Fire Boon, but I don't think that would make a very fun pawn to have around, so I gave him some different skills). ---- If anyone fancies having some Vermundian soldiers for pawns, here they are. In case you hire any of them, hope it's to your liking! I also want to, eventually, create an Archer Vermundian Pawn, but creating these, even with the help of a late game safe file, is a bit time consuming, so maybe an idea for another time. In any case, if you feel I can improve them in any way, I'm open to suggestions too. Cheers! submitted by /u/m8-wutisdis to r/DragonsDogma2 [link] [comments]",

Now normally I wouldnt even be mad and sad cuz it's just a game, but those pets were all gifts that my girlfriend made to me. She sacrificed many pets in her account, even things she loved Just for getting me some pets i likes. And now, all my pets, all her sacrifices: GONE. I dont even know this guy/girl. I dont even remember playing with him in a server. I dont even wake up at 6 AM, I wake up a 7 AM. Now i feel mad, and sad, and most of all, i feel like i broke a promise, and despite all the times She told me \"it's not your fault\", i still think it's my fault. Maybe if i decided to login earlier something would've changed. Maybe if i decided to transfer my pets to another account this could've been avoided. I Hope that my report will be seen and that this story will be ready, and that this scum of a human being Will be banned, over and over and over and over and over. Thank you for your time. -Qbic (AKA Fakeranni) (NOTE: I never asked her for pets, She just gave them to me, not even knowing if i wanted them or not, and this makes me even more mad.

      "content": "There seems to be an obsession with adding online multiplayer to every game. At this point, it feels like every game is expected to have online features, but honestly, I think a lot of players struggle to find people to play with, and many of us don’t want to sit in a lobby listening to a horde of screaming kids. Making VR games is already difficult for indie devs, and supporting online multiplayer makes it even harder, and most importantly, it often results in less overall content. I could give many examples, but take Battle Talent for instance. It’s one of my favorite VR games: it has tons of systems, lots of enemy types, lots of weapons, etc. The devs have been pushing updates for a long time, which is great, and those updates are genuinely impressive. But over the past year they’ve been focusing heavily on online features, and personally I lost interest, while still thinking adding more core content could really transform this indie title into something totally unmatched in VR. Another example is Undead Citadel, which had a relatively lukewarm launch. Many people were disappointed by the amount of contents (not the gameplay itself), and now it looks like the team is working on a “multiplayer update.” Honestly, I just hope they add more than multiplayer (and from what I’ve seen, it seems they will). Online play, sandbox modes, mod support… all of that is nice to have. But to me, it’s more like the icing on the cake, not the cake itself. How do you guys feel? Is it just me coping because I have no friends, or do you also miss content-heavy single-player games? submitted by /u/Enculin to r/VRGaming [link] [comments]",

I'd like to avoid this. My first instinct would be to put an underscore before the parameter, e.g.: func _init(_character: Character) -> void: character = _character But, using an underscore on a parameter is the indicator to Godot to ignore unused parameters... so I don't want to use an underscore here. My next instinct would be to put a $ before the parameter, e.g.: ``` This is NOT valid code func _init($character: Character) -> void: character = $character ``` But $ have a special meaning in Godot and are not valid characters in a parameter name. Unfortunately, the official style guide also doesn't mention anything about this. Anyone have any clever, clean, universal approaches to this problem? submitted by /u/samanime [link] [comments]",

      "content": "I’ve always found this take that Luka would have multiple rings if he was on the Celtics to be flawed for many reasons: Preventing player development: Luka Doncic, a player that’s very ball dominant would likely mean the Celtics guard duo of Derrick White and Payton Pritchard wouldn’t have been able to develop into the players they are today because of Luka’s usage rate. Defensive liability: The Celtics built their championship team around the idea that their starting 5 players could switch onto an opposing player and defend them to a decent degree. With Luka on the court teams would have an immediate weak link to hunt on offense. Disrupts the Celtics balanced attack: The Celtics championship run consisted of multiple players that could get 20 points a game and with Luka’s usage you would’ve definitely seen less games where Porzingis or Jrue would’ve been able to showcase their offensive talent. It would’ve also made the five-out offense less reliable as most of the three-point shot attempts would be coming from one guy making the Celtics a more predictable team. This is further shown by the struggles he had playing with Porzingis. Similarly, would Jalen Brunson take the jump to the next level if he was still playing with the mavericks and Luka. This is not me arguing that Jayson Tatum could’ve taken Luka’s 2024 mavericks to the finals but I believe people often try to use this argument to prove that one player only wins because of their roster rather than understand how a player is able to fit and adapt to a system which matters more in determining the success they’d have on that team. submitted by /u/Majestic-Web-367 to r/NBATalk [link] [comments]",

Not to mention even when all their bones are broken and they’re just lying there, they still don’t count as a kill, even if they can’t get up or do anything.

On top of that, a lot of Taobao or Alibaba links either bug out or don’t show up at all, and even tracking and QC pics have been hit or miss. It’s getting pretty frustrating to deal with. I decided to try Hipobuy after their recent site update, and it’s actually way more convenient than I expected. You can use cnfans links directly on Hipobuy without converting them, and cnfans spreadsheets seem to work fine too. The whole site just feels smoother and more reliable overall. They also brought back 30% off shipping coupons, which is nice. On top of that, if you forward your packages from the cnfans warehouse to Hipobuy, they pay for your domestic shipping, which is kind of crazy. I haven’t really seen another agent offer something like that before. With all the issues going on with cnfans, switching to Hipobuy honestly feels like the logical move at this point.

      "content": "In episode 16 of Gnosia, Remnan worries about being caught running away unlawfully and being captured if the D.Q.O. goes to a base. I've finished the game too, so I know that in it, his concern is rather about having to \"see\" someone. I'm curious about any theories/reasoning for the reasons for his concern in the anime. Is running away unlawfully really that big of a concern? Even if he left a planet without going through the correct process, this is because he escaped slavery. Wouldn't an exception be made? Or is he simply worried about the process of having to clarify this? Alternatively, if he ran away illegally, this could imply that slavery is legal in Gnosia, or has different legalities depending on the planet. However, I always figured Manan kept Remnan secret from anyone outside of her trusted circle. In the game, his worry about having to see someone is very vague, but from his events and general demeanor, the player is naturally made to think about Manan. It would make sense that, if he reported to a military base, she could possibly find out and track him down, at least in his POV. What do you all think? I'm open to discussion regarding this. Either way, it was nice to finally have a Remnan and Raqio moment adapted to the anime. submitted by /u/proboty to r/Gnosia_ [link] [comments]",

No matter what settings I use there's this ghosting on the item I'm holding and everything becomes blurry whenever I move and it's making me dizzy and hurting my eyes. The only time the ghosting and blur when moving is gone is when I use FXAA. But now I have a new problem where everything is too sharp. The clip I uploaded is just me showing the blur and ghosting I'm talking about but I've tried doing dlss on and off, full screen, windowed etc. I tried limiting fps, turning the motion blur on and off, global illumination on and off, going from low to ultra settings. But nothing changes. It's still blurry and has that ghosting effect except for when I use fxaa which makes everything too sharp and still makes my eyes hurt. Outside the settings I've also tried the compatability mode I've seen people suggesting in the forums but still it has this same effect. I tried searching for solutions but not much people seem to be having the same issues as me. Thank you for the help in advance.

But it's honestly really difficult because a lot of the time, the experience for me is teammates going \"I wanna make this game I've had as an idea for years\" months or whatever. While that's fine, I don't really think a game jam is the place to do that. Especially before the theme is even announced. I find this to be very frustrating as it introduces a lot of scope creep and can cause you to fixate on a \"dream game\" that may not even be that great or related to the theme. To me, making a game for a game jam is about a fresh idea, that's short and sweet. Not system heavy and full of unfinished ideas. Maybe I'm being an ass, I don't know. I'm also not confrontational, so I'm not going \"Let's not do this, let's focus on finishing something then adding 'flavor' to it afterwards.\" It's just everytime, I regret not working solo. submitted by /u/Same_Bar4349 [link] [comments]",

I'm currently making a pool game and I'm trying to make it so that the game will show your ball's trajectory, and if it collided with a ball it'll show the direction of where the hit ball would go. Originally I tried getting the direction like this but it wasn't super accurate var target_direction = (hit_position - self.global_position).normalized() bounce_line_2d.add_point(collider.global_position) bounce_line_2d.add_point(hit_position + target_direction * 200) Using the normal is closer but still inaccurate if shape_cast_2d.is_colliding(): var hit_position = shape_cast_2d.get_collision_point(0) var normal = shape_cast_2d.get_collision_normal(0) var collider = shape_cast_2d.get_collider(0) trajectory_line_2d.add_point(self.global_position) trajectory_line_2d.add_point(hit_position) collision_preview.global_position = hit_position collision_preview.visible = true if collider.is_in_group(\"balls\"): var target_direction = -normal bounce_line_2d.add_point(collider.global_position) bounce_line_2d.add_point(collider.global_position + target_direction * 200) The balls are rigid bodies and to detect collision im using a shape cast that's the same size as the ball.

The forge is a space to upgrade wedges, and the forge master is so kind that they offer the first one for half off! These upgrades are permanent, and will persist throughout the entirety of a player's run. I didn't have time to finish it this week, but I wanted to showcase some of the work I've put in for the next enemy. This also got me to make a separate scene to see the sprite animations within the engine, rather than within my sprite editor (Piskel).

Frankly, I don't see any other game series that would be so good and so frequent with their releases (although frequent releases arguably became an issue lately, but still) You may consider it a toxic positivity, but I'm aware of all the flaws of the series for the past six or so months, and I don't like any of that as well. It's just that RGG Studio is still the best dev team in my eyes, as they have set the bar quite high, hence I'm still excited for new releases How do you feel about Yakuza series regardless of its state right now?

One of the core mechanics is a terminal-based puzzle: the player sits at a workstation with two monitors - one for console input, one for server states. There’s intentionally no visible command list. The idea is discovery through observation rather than explicit tutorials. As a solo dev, I’m unsure where the line is between: - intriguing discovery - and unnecessary frustration I’d really appreciate feedback from other solo devs: Would you feel motivated to experiment here? What small cues would help without breaking immersion? Short WIP clip attached. submitted by /u/Character-Credit-208 [link] [comments]",

However I noticed with the \"process call : physics\" my character was not having problems but the other elements moving (the cars in this case) were jittering a little when my character (thus the camera) were moving. When I put the process call to Idle, my character was jittering since I use the physics process, but the cars werent. Is there a way to fix the issue other than using physics process on the cars since they don't really need physics ?

If your partner consistently does things that hurt you or make you feel insecure or undervalued, *love will not change them.* If your gut tells you they’re maybe just kind of with you until they find someone “better,” you cannot love them into loving you fully. If they rant to you about how horrible all their ex partners & friends are — *you are not a break in the cycle, you’re just on the next loop-de-loop* — If it’s that many people, it’s not their exes, it’s not you: it’s them. I know we all want to believe that people can change, and trust me - I know how difficult it is to cut the cord when someone alternates hurtful behavior with lovebombing - when you keep seeing flashes of the person you wish they’d be. That’s often enough to keep people trapped in bad relationships for years. But if any part of this resonates with you, please try to take it to heart that you deserve better. You have to be a kind and patient person in order to want to help “fix” a broken person, but you may be breaking yourself in the process without even realizing it. You’re not a bad person for walking away from a toxic situation. I promise there is a better relationship out there, with someone who will actually appreciate and return the love and kindness you are currently pouring into ((whoever they are)) submitted by /u/uta_refson to r/actuallesbians [link] [comments]",

The Data: The current consensus is that the game is worth $10 . The Issue: My car sounds like a lawnmower exploding. The Ask: I need about 2,000 of you to go into the demo and vote $30 . This will artificially inflate the game's value and hopefully manifest a new muffler for my Honda. https://store.steampowered.com/app/4225400/IT_Never_Ends/ submitted by /u/Euphoric-Series-1194 to r/IndieDev [link] [comments]",

Rule #5 - with your suggestion, make sure you add their name and franchise they're from (you'll get a bonus upvotes if you include an image or gif) Rule #6 - evil clowns, are welcome, however! if you want to add an evil clown, make sure to ask yourself \"why are they a clown?\" do they like to perform? do they like to make others laugh? do they enjoy smiling? Rule #7 - a friendly clown is always welcome, even if their reason for being a clown is questionable Rule #8 - groups are welcome, just make sure that the group itself has an official name Rule #9 - if there's a tie, a wheel will be spun (yesterday, Keheheh Kekerakera and Piedmon had the same amount of votes) Rule #10 - fan made clowns aren't allowed ---------- side note: everytime I mention clown in the rules, I also mean jesters and mimes tip: this entire roster idea, is based on the video, \"Top Ten Video Game Clowns\" by The Green Scorpion, so you can watch that video to get a better idea submitted by /u/MinimumPotential6468 to r/createaroster [link] [comments]",

This is what happens when you grew up in 80s NYC clubs: Area, The Tunnel, Visage, The Palladium - - - and you refuse to settle for algorithmic bullshit. This is me spanning 50 YEARS of music (yes, fifty) because I'm genre agnostic and I don't care what decade it came from if it makes me FEEL like a woman, not a demographic. You won't find force-fed \"empowerment anthems\" here, no drunk-girl-screaming playlist everyone makes, nothing that sounds like it came from a focus group. What you WILL find is Blondie's \"Call Me\" from 1980 sitting right next to Peggy Gou's \"(It Goes Like) Nanana\" from 2023. You'll find Basia -- BASIA, because who the heck remembers her? I do. You'll find Laufey's \"From The Start\" making you swoon before Purple Disco Machine makes you move. Grace Jones, Donna Summer, CHIC—the queens who taught the game. WAR and Earth, Wind & Fire because sometimes you need funk, not feelings. Chappell Roan and RAYE because good music doesn't have an expiration date. This playlist is for the women who know that Fleetwood Mac's \"Everywhere\" from 1987 still hits you different every time, who can dance to Sheila B. Devotion's French disco , who appreciate that Lianne La Havas and Jessie Ware exist, who remember when Madonna made music that mattered, who understand that Dua Lipa's \"Levitating\" belongs right next to Michael Jackson's \"Rock With You.\" This isn't a nostalgia trip and it's not a \"new music\" playlist.

I really want to get 2 sets of travel battle and combine them to make a 40 inch length 10 inch depth field of battle, since it works for my space. My question is, I understand that the native rulesets are very light, and that it is the rules that really make the war game and not the pieces. What, if any, are good, but not grognard complex, rulesets appliable to travel battle and this scale?

Long story short to implement it within 2 weeks (not full time), and I must say this is quite exciting. In the video I am using my macbook and 2 phones (one using mobile data). The video capture is from my macbook. I don't know if it helps but I am using the Noray stack by Netfox (open source) that I am hosting on DigitalOcean. The server deployment was very easy, but I had to re adjust few things in my game while learning new multiplayer concepts... It's just the beginning and I am running into some issues (sync, lag, rollback ...etc), but I thought it could be positive to share stuff about multiplayer. And it makes me happy ^^ submitted by /u/papanouel [link] [comments]",

As someone that has loved playing games all his life and never had anything giving me the feeling that Skyrim and Minecraft gave me back in the day, Hytale comes pretty darn close. In fact it is so good, I really want to put my life into its progression! I started to learn coding/ modding a bit, created the first 2-3 mob/npc designs with animations and already created several Al's for ingame behaviour. Sadly I have no qualifications on paper whatsoever, only my work that's been done. Does anyone know, how the Hytale/ Hypixel team could see me? I have infinite ideas, infinite time and an infinite desire for this project. Even though I am nothing special obviously. I don't even need nearly the salary they promised to employees, I'd be happy with less than half of what people earn there. Just want to be a part of something amazing for once I'll add pictures of the creations below, I made them completely from 0, no templates, no help.

As we journey through life, it's crucial to have a roadmap and milestones to guide us toward success. This month, we're drawing inspiration from the book that has sparked many transformative journeys - \"The One Thing\" by Gary Keller and Jay Papasan. ​ **The Power of Focusing on \"The One Thing\"** ​ In \"The One Thing,\" Keller and Papasan emphasize the importance of clarity, focus, and prioritization when it comes to achieving your goals. They advocate for finding that \"one thing\" that, when accomplished, will make everything else easier or unnecessary. This concept can be a game-changer in our quest for success. ​ **Monthly Challenge: Define Your \"One Thing\"** ​ Here's our challenge for this month: Take some time to reflect on your goals, whether they're related to your career, personal life, or health. What is that one thing that, if accomplished, would have the most significant positive impact on your journey? ​ - Write it down. - Break it into actionable steps. - Create a timeline. ​ By doing this, you'll have a clear, actionable plan for moving closer to your goals, step by step. ​ **Share Your Insights** ​ We encourage you to share your thoughts, experiences, and progress throughout the month. Have you read \"The One Thing,\" and if so, how has it influenced your approach to goal-setting and achievement? ​ Remember, every journey begins with a single step. Let's take those steps together and support each other in making our dreams a reality. 🚀💪 ​ Stay tuned for more inspiration and motivation as we work toward our \"one thing\" this month! submitted by /u/AutoModerator to r/MarketingOneZeroOne [link] [comments]",

I already finished the game and unlocked the Goat content. However, in the in-game tarot list it still shows 66 out of 85 tarot cards, and the trophy for collecting all tarot cards hasn’t unlocked yet. There os no ??? Card slot, all show some tarot card. I’m playing the base version from PS Plus (no DLC purchased). I dont known what I missing. Maybe some specific tarot cards that have special unlock condition. I’m also missing the last two follower forms in the list, I’d really appreciate clarification where to get them. At this point I just want to make sure: What exactly counts toward the 85 tarot cards? What cards até mandadory for the trophie? Is there any known PS5 / PS Plus version issue I should know about? Any guidance would be hugely appreciated — I’m so close to the platinum and don’t want to miss it before the game leaves PS Plus.

It's a slightly different backroom than usual: the levels, some of which are very similar to those of Backrooms' creepypasta, but others have never been seen but imagined by me or inspired by movies and series or events that actually happened. It's a horror platformer, inspired, you have to look for keys and take coins (the latter is currently a beta), with monsters or levels where you have to overcome some platforms or with puzzles and much more. It's still in early access, but I'd like to make it perfect, and that's why it's in early access, so I'll listen to advice and improvements. The game currently has 10 levels, but I estimate that it will reach 50 or a maximum of 100 levels. Also, for now, the game is in single-player, but I'm already working on multiplayer. I'm also working on a new mode that will be one of the few backroom games that allow you to do this, I don't want to do spoilers, but it will be cool and I want to create a real community about my backroom game. I'll give you a preview of the first level, I want to assure you that this game is a platformer, but it's not just a platformer, we'll also have to solve puzzles, run away from monsters and much more, because I don't want a static game that's dynamic and full of things and choices.

Then I load that back on the next run. What I’ve noticed is that if the FPS drops in the first round, then the playback won’t be accurate on the second. I’m pretty sure this is because Tick is FPS-dependent. So I’m wondering: is there any way to do some sort of multi-threaded tick that runs independently from FPS? Is “Set Timer by Event” the same as Tick, or would that solve my problem?

      "content": "Hello. Firstly, I want to say that I know that the tips you see online, in videos, or books, are actually valid. My problem with most of them is that they are goals, but they are given in the form of advice, like \"put your own needs first\", \"learn to say no\", \"set boundaries\", \"learn about who you are and what you want\", \"focus on yourself\", etc. I hear these and some other ones a LOT and they already make me feel horrible for not being capable of doing them. I haven't gone a full week without shutting down for days, there's absolutely no way I can take care of myself or do basic household chores (or even get up and walk to the bathroom). I'd just be doing chores in a terrible state, with nothing changing, eventually feeling worse. \"Put your own needs first\" is a good goal, but actually doing that leads to more small traumas for me. Absolutely none of these do anything for me. I feel like the emptiness has taken over too much. I've never been able to function. I saw an EMDR therapist for the first time today (just the assessment) and we're starting the work in 2 weeks. I shut down as soon as I got home for unrelated reasons (people in uni). I need something to WORK and make me feel a little better until I see some results from EMDR. submitted by /u/Voroojac to r/emotionalneglect [link] [comments]",

New Vegas is basically supposed to be the Wild West so why would you live in there and want to be bossed around and taxed by some jarhead liberals? Do you even need the protection/extortion? The Mojave is full of extremely powerful guns basically lying around everywhere in the open. You do not need soldiers to protect you. The NCR npcs are also extremely annoying and aggressive and demand you submit to their fake government authority. At least The Enclave are actually descendants of the original USA government. They have a sort of more legitimate authority even if it is evil. NCR on the other hand are just some libs from California who all of the sudden decided they have a right to rule the entire wasteland. Who made you God? I don’t think anyone voted for the NCR. The game shills them so hard even the devs wore NCR shirts at E3. NCR is obviously a self insert of the devs WOKE libtard ideology and if you choose not to side with them you will have EVIL karma. “Oh but what about the Legion? They are more evil so you have to side with the NCR.” Exactly the same logic the fake left uses to just supporting the democrats every single election. At least the Legion is trying something different from the same ideology that destroyed the entire planet. “but the legion r fascist!!!!1” Oh and NCR are not? Nope NCR are just as much fascist Nazis. They want to bring back the same imperialism usa does. Also it’s clear the devs made the Legion as comically evil as possible to try and force you into supporting the NCR. Nice try libtards. I always side with the Legion anyway. It is more fun to LARP as Juba the Sniper and pwn imperialist NCR skkkum. Now on a another note aesthetically they are also objectively the worst faction. Their uniforms look absolutely hideous. Also forgot to mention Boone is such an overrated and terrible character. He is basically Chris Kyle The American Sniper. A pathetic emo who never shuts up about his stupid wife. lol so edgy, cringe, gross, hateful and vengeful nasty character. He tries to portray himself as some sort of poor ptsd vet hurt by war yet he obviously is a psychopath who just loves violence and killing. Like if you were so morally good you wouldn’t choose to be a sniper merc and follow the courier around killing as many people as possible. This is a character made for people who have a punisher skull on their F150. Boone SUCKS. There are absolutely no redeeming qualities whatsoever about the NCR they are the worst faction to side with for the wasteland. The only faction that comes close to being as bad is the Followers of The Apocalypse who are basically like IRL radlib anarchists who shill for the NCR/Democrat party. The Followers are basically useful idiots for the NCR and do everything they want. WOKE libtard nazis DESTROYED with FACTS and LOGIC. submitted by /u/Sweet-Ad-7887 to r/TrueAnon [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Immersive customization MATTERS for CFB27. For the past years all we’ve gotten are a few new helmets, cleats, and gloves that’s it. Meanwhile everything else has been the same. What we’re suggesting is not “ unnecessary” it’s the bare minimum for realistic college football equipment in 2026. And before anybody starts crying “gameplay first” we AGREE. Gameplay glitches need to be fixed and on field gameplay should be elite. But let’s stop acting like it’s one or the other. EA uses different dev teams for different aspects of the game. The people working on gameplay aren’t the same ones handling player models, uniforms, accessories, and customization. Both can be improved. It’s honestly weird how some of y’all think immersive customization “takes away” from the game. Nobody trashes gameplay suggestions so why force hate on customization requests? It makes no sense. If you want your players wearing outdated or basic gear, cool. That option will still be there. But what’s wrong with letting the people who actually care about customization have the freedom to use newer, more realistic options? Choice doesn’t hurt anyone it only makes the game better. Right now we can’t even equip half the stuff real college athletes wear every Saturday. In a game that’s supposed to be a realistic college football experience, that’s unacceptable.

Features: 5 skills (2.5 million steps worth of content which will always be free) Should work with Apple watches immediately (reads Apple Healthkit for step data) Inventory, leveling, and progression similiar to Runescape No inventory limit, no traveling, and you spend steps like a currency after your walk.

Cus i feel my roots all go back to Macromedia Flash MX... that was the first software that opened the door for me to start learning animation and gamedev way back in like ~2005!! It was also where i found community online with other animators and gamedevs, and really launched my creative path... so i really owe a lot of my life to discovering that program... Especially today because one of the online friendships from back in the day (learning Actionscript and collaborating on tiny Flash games) got revitalized because of Godot 4, now 20 years later marks the release of our first commercial game today using Godot 4.2!! https://store.steampowered.com/app/3212630/Rogue_Factory/ The Flash era is soon to be officially donezo, but at least we're in this current FOSS era with software like Godot!! It feels like a great era to be making games Super grateful for its existence and the community behind it, because I feel the same way about it now like I did with Flash back in the day! So thank you to Godot for enabling us to make this, and a thank you to Flash for starting our journeys and thank you to YOU if you wanna check out our game and wishlist and/or support. gl hf! submitted by /u/ecaroh_games [link] [comments]",

Is that really it? I would be more than happy to accept a trade-off of better graphics in exchange for fewer new features, or new features at the expense of graphics. The problem is we’re getting neither. They’re a business. They obviously want to maximize profits.

Which is exciting, but also the moment where every decision starts to feel permanent… and slightly terrifying. Before locking ourselves into choices we might regret later, we put together a short survey to get some outside perspective. It touches things like difficulty, punishment, narrative weight, atmosphere, and also the less fun but very real side of indie dev like marketing, discovery, and why players actually trust or wishlist a game. We don’t have a publisher or safety net, so this kind of feedback genuinely helps us avoid shooting ourselves in the foot. The survey is in English, anonymous, and doesn’t take forever. Link here: https://bewdbros.studio/forms/helpusbuildourgame If you feel like helping a fellow indie team make slightly fewer bad decisions, we’d really appreciate it. And if anything interesting comes out of it, we’re happy to share what we learned. Thanks, and good luck surviving your own vertical slice.

I am making a Qi2 Wireless Car Charger to replace the current wireless charger in my car. Since most smartphones nowadays have a large camera bump, I wanted to have a plate that will be pushed down when the phones camera bump is pressed on it, and pushed back up when the phone is removed. The reason I'm posting is because I want to figure out a way to lock the plate in place when the wireless charger is off. This is a nice-to-have since this way, if the wireless charger is off, the plate being locked allows the user to place whatever coins, car keys, or whatever on there without the plate sinking down. I need some kind of electrical mechanical mechanism for this, but I wasn't sure what would be the best one for the job. My first thought was servo motors, but I wanted to ask else I should consider using if I didn't or couldn't use a servo motor. submitted by /u/ThePeacefulOne to r/MechanicalEngineering [link] [comments]",

I had been interested in starting a game development side project for a few months and had recently built a flappy bird clone in Unity. Then I saw a tutorial series on youtube by HeartBeast about creating an ARPG in Godot 3. After watching that amazing series I decided to choose Godot as the engine. We started developing the game on Godot 4.2 and upgraded to 4.3 and then 4.4 which is what we are currently using. Our studio consists of one full time developer (myself, the founder), a part time developer (my co-founder) as well as a few of our friends who helped with ideas, play testing and some world design. The art assets we used were all sourced from asset packs or commissioned from artists found on Reddit/Itch/Fiverr/Youtube.

      "content": "Hello guys, So my current setup is that I have an animation one shot that as the in parameter has the locomotion blend tree and as the shot parameter an animation state machine. The state machine is used to make the following actions for example: Jump -> Fall-> Land or Jump -> Fall -> Idle (If fallen from low height). My problem is that in the animation state machine, I have the transition from Fall directly to End of the state machine and it has a condition \"ended\" that i set true when in the Fall animation which is looping i want to immediately end the animation to get back to the locomotion. The condition is then reset to false when the animation state machine gets to the End node using the state_entered signal. But then, when adding an Xfade time to the transition, the character seems to have a delay based on the time put there before going back to the locomotion blend tree. Has anyone ever encountered the same problem as me and fixed it? Thank you Animation Blend Tree Node Actions State Machine - Assume that the transtion from Fall to End is Auto and has the \\\"ended\\\" condition submitted by /u/aris1401 [link] [comments]",

The buffs don't seem that impactful, and I don't think the game is very generous with skillpoints either to have players waste a turn just to fix this second HP bar. I'm also not sure how I feel about the specificity of guides. Like, in other games, it's usually more of a system where they are separated based on their class, and then designed to synergize with their intended holder, while others can still make use of them. But here, they just completely remove a guide's passive if you don't match them. I know story-wise they are couples with the esper, but it feels a bit weird. And then I pull a 5\\ guide, and then suddenly I feel pressured to get the esper because its just a guiding effect and a stat stick without them?)

Trying new things and pushing my sound in different directions has been a big part of my journey as a musician. Lately, I’ve been wanting to take that experience and apply it to something bigger than personal projects, which is why I’m really interested in getting into game scoring. Video games have always inspired me, not just because of the gameplay, but because of how music and sound design shape the mood and pull you into the world. I’d love to work with developers—indie or otherwise—to help bring their projects to life with original music. If you’re working on a game and need a composer, feel free to reach out.

      "content": "Hello! I really hope this post is allowed. I’m a lifelong gamer and musician (22 years of playing guitar) and in the past few years I’ve taken a huge interest in composing music for video games. I have a massive folder in my DAW filled with tracks and ideas spanning numerous genres. I’ve mixed and mastered quite a few specifically for a gaming experience. I would really love to collaborate with an indie studio to make music for. I’m capable of creating every sound, voice, etc etc that would be needed. I can actually probably handle every sound you’d need, creating an original soundtrack and audio that isn’t relying on premade audio assets. I have my own fully functional studio, software, instruments, etc. And I wouldn’t even charge anything unless the game just took off and there was money to be given. Just having my music and audio in a game is enough for me right now while trying to build a reputation off of this. (I’m a firefighter/paramedic in the “real” world). If anyone is needing this particular skill set to help complete your project, I’d be happy to send clips and samples of tracks I’ve made and see if my work can speak for itself. I’ve made everything from synth wave, to 8bit-ish tracks, to Mick Gordon type production Metal. Hope to hear from anyone who wants to work together soon! submitted by /u/SonnofaMitch [link] [comments]",

      "content": "I’m curious if anyone knows how PLAs work in terms of Camera and Occlusion culling? What I mean is, in a traditional rendering pipeline one of the benefits of building your level out of modular meshes is that you get Camera Culling. i.e. If you have a tower that is 20 stories tall, but you’re standing at the base of the tower, then everything above the ground floor can be culled as it’s no longer in the view frustrum. Whereas if you make the tower as one piece, then it has to draw the upper floors even if you can’t see them because all of the geo is connected. With Packed Level Actors, the engine supposedly combines meshes to lower draw calls and for efficiency, but are they actually combined as in welded together, or are they still considered separate meshes as far as Culling is concerned? If I’m making a giant tower comprised of thousands of meshes, is it beneficial to turn the entire tower into one Packed Level Actor, or, should I selectively combine the meshes into several dozen PLAs? I’m also curious how PLAs are handled in streaming. If a PLA falls between two level streaming volumes or in two partitions of the world, will it be removed in its entirety or will parts of it be removed (I’ll test this after I post). I’m guessing the entirety will be removed as I believe it is a Blueprint Actor at its core, but maybe it’s not the same?

Career is boring, barebones and pointless with a fighter roster so small you spend 90% of your time fighting copy/paste created fighters and clicking through menus.. Core fighting mechanics are just as sluggish and boring as they were before with awkward controls. Punches miss when you're right up in thier face and they aren't even moving, still? It's been a couple years my dudes, wtf have you been doing? It's now 100% clear to me that this company doesn't actually give any cares about this game and never will. It's just a BS scam that survives off of licensing deals because nobody wants to buy this piece of crap. Back to fight night champion it is..fuck this company and fuck this game.

      "content": "I’ve noticed something interesting talking to friends who do gig work, freelance jobs, or small side businesses. The majority of them struggle not because they make too little money, but rather because their income is erratic and they don't modify their spending accordingly. People typically spend on their best weeks rather than their average ones when money arrives at random (good week, slow week). Stress begins there. Keeping track of income separate from simply checking your bank balance is one thing that really helps. Decisions become less sentimental and more pragmatic when you can clearly see: - How much you actually make each week or month on average - How much goes toward fuel, food, and fixed bills. For drivers, independent contractors, and small business owners, the game is different; visibility and patterns are more important than rigid monthly budgets. However, budgeting advice frequently assumes a fixed salary. I'm curious about how people with erratic income handle the highs and lows. submitted by /u/NecessaryDrive1043 to r/povertyfinance [link] [comments]",

Let me know if any issues are persisting with StarBinder that I might be able to look at fixing. But as always step one of troubleshooting is to make sure you're using Chrome/Edge as your browser (although apparently for Linux users the preferred browser is Firefox). https://starbinder.space/ --- And for folks who are wondering \" WTF is Star Binder? \", I'll paste the description here: StarBinder is an unofficial Star Citizen browser-based utility I put together that makes keybinds searchable , filterable , and customisable . Unlike the in-game UI, StarBinder lets you combine just about any key combination imaginable (not all of which will work, but it lets you try), plus you can choose between a bunch of activation modes, not just \"double tap\". Star Binder lets you export to an XML file which can then be ported directly into Star Citizen using the in-game menu. You can also import a Star Citizen-compatible keybind XML. submitted by /u/Z0MGbies to r/starcitizen [link] [comments]",

He would like to connect and analyse the store data through Google Tableau/Looker. (The info we see in the dev hub overview/analytics) My question: Is there any SDK/API integration that automatically downloads each games data (sales, add-ons sold, etc.. not in app events) and connects them to our Tableau overview? In the overview tab for each game we can't even download one .csv file for all the data, we have to go into each metric and manually download a .csv file. That can't be the only way, right ? If anyone has experience with that or knows a way around to get the games data in an external software like Google Tableau, Looker, etc.. please let me know!

Mein Hauptaugenmerk liegt auf Spieleentwicklung , aktuell vor allem mit Unity . Letztes Semester haben wir eine Extended Reality-Anwendung mit der Meta Quest 3 gebaut und mein aktueller PC (16 GB RAM) stößt dabei langsam an seine Grenzen. In Zukunft möchte ich auch mit anderen Engines wie Godot oder Unreal arbeiten und allgemein meinen Horizont im Game Dev erweitern. Nebenbei spiele ich auch gern, aber eher so Spiele wie Minecraft, Stardew Valley, Escape Simulator, Life is Strange etc... selten große AAA-Titel. Mein aktueller PC hat folgende Specs (gekauft vor ca. 4,5 Jahren): Prozessor: Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-10400F CPU @ 2.90GHz, 2904 MHz, 6 Kern(e), 12 logische(r) Prozessor(en) BaseBoard: ASRock B560 Pro4 Ram: 16GB DDR4 Grafikkarte: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Ti Netzteil: be quiet! System Power B9 600W ATX 2.4 Wo sollte ich am besten aufrüsten? Ich habe zuerst überlegt mir einen komplett neuen zuzulegen... Aber vielleicht kann ich das ein oder andere Teil ja noch behalten. Ich habe ein Budget von ca. 2000€. Das ist allerdings nicht festgefahren. Danke schonmal für eure Hilfe! 😊 submitted by /u/Junior_Day_3729 to r/PCBaumeister [link] [comments]",

      "content": "I'll be blunt. My game was called Egg Farm Simulator. After a few months of development, I decided to change the name to Eggstreme Farming. Why? • There was already a mini-game on Roblox with the same name. • “Simulator” is extremely generic on Steam. • The name had no identity whatsoever. I thought changing the name would help with reach and wishlists, but it didn't help and had no relevant impact. Before the change, I was getting an average of 3–5 wishlists per day and after the change… I'm still getting 3–5 wishlists per day. Currently I have 290 wishlists. So, at least so far, the name change hasn't had a real impact on wishlists. Even so, I don't regret it. The game now has a stronger name, easier to remember, and that seems less generic. I was just curious about one thing. What do you think could be changed or improved to enhance the results on wishlists? I believe the game has the potential for better results. Currently, my marketing strategy (which I started last week) is to post videos about the development/gameplay on TikTok and YouTube shorts and post updates here on Reddit. submitted by /u/Alex4ndres [link] [comments]",

(Took two weeks. ) Did some play-testing(had around 10 playtesters) on it and the reviews were good and the feedback was all really useful. I have been refining and fixing almost all the bugs that people spotted/adding features that seemed necessary and so on. But this has not increased plays or increased retention. This iterative process has taken another 3 weeks. While I say reviews were good, none of them were truly glowing, not enough to give me confidence to continue the project. Almost no one returned for a second run by themselves. I do not want to keep working on a game that people don't genuinely enjoy. But I don't know if the polished version will be something worth it. I am very confused as to what to do. Do you guys have metrics or methods that tell you when to call it quits on a game dev project? Or is it generally solely passion driven? If you have a story as to what helped you quit a game-dev project and move on to the next one, even that would help. submitted by /u/Zorro_997 [link] [comments]",

I tried everything, I implemented in within Animation Blueprint, I tried to run it via montage. same result. Then I contemplated maybe dodge animation's end is seting to idle animation and not run that's why the blend is feeling wrong but when I tried to print velocity, the character was indeed stopping.

      "content": "For my upcoming game “Waddle Words” on Steam, I added configurable accessories in multiplayer mode. I initially wanted to implement this with AnimatedSprite2D, but then realized that these are quite complex to create using code. So I switched to Sprite2D, and all sprite sheets have the same number of columns and rows so that they can be easily superimposed. A node then updates the corresponding goose and all the accessories above it in each frame. The setup code for this is a bit lengthy, but in principle it's no different from what would be defined in AnimatedSprite2D. If you have found a much easier solution I am eager to learn. :) var _state_frames: Dictionary[State, AnimationGooseMenuDescription] = { State.NONE: AnimationGooseMenuDescription.new([5], 1, false), State.IDLE: AnimationGooseMenuDescription.new([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 1], 6, true), State.APPEAR: AnimationGooseMenuDescription.new([5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], 12, false), State.DISAPPEAR: AnimationGooseMenuDescription.new([12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5], 12, false), State.HONK: AnimationGooseMenuDescription.new([14, 15, 16, 15, 14], 12, false) } submitted by /u/Truemmerwelt to r/godot [link] [comments]",

There are just so many different things that the show doesn't have enough time to properly cover. But a game would. Like, I'm very interested what other Vaults there are and how they're like. Maybe it could be a game where you play as a Vault dweller? Or maybe it could be set in the past, back when the NCR still existed, and tell us a story of how it came to be? Or maybe it could focus on the East Coast and the Brotherhood? Also, which studio do you think is the best for that task? It may be controversial, but in my opinion, it's Bethesda. Starfield had potential, but the setting was a total miss. Fallout, meanwhile, is more grounded, and already has plenty of established lore.

This is ideal, since that's less than half the size of the Variant. However, legend has it that booleans still take up 20 bytes, whether they're statically-typed or not.

      "content": "I have been working with 2D Navigation Maps in Godot for a while now, and I have always wondered if anyone has a solution for multiple different sizes of agents. For example, all my tiles are 16x16 pixels and their colliders are the same size. However, if I have an agent with a collider that is larger than 16x16 pixels, naturally, my agent will try and pathfind through gaps it could never possibly fit through. Is there some kind of parameter or something I can change in the Agent or TileMapLayer's navigation settings that will allow for agents of varying sizes to pathfind all on the same navigation map? I apologize if the terms I'm using are not entirely accurate, I'm also happy to answer additional questions in the comments below. submitted by /u/CurlyBoyOli [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Hey everyone, I’m an indie game dev and I’ve been trying to use TikTok to share our development process, but honestly… I’m pretty confused about what actually matters there. I’ve been experimenting for a while: short dev clips, mood/edit videos, optimization stuff, using trending sounds, posting at different times, different video lengths, etc. Sometimes a video gets decent engagement, sometimes it completely dies, even when it feels similar in quality. At this point I’m not sure if I’m missing something obvious or if TikTok is just that random. So I wanted to ask people who have actually used TikTok for game dev and seen *some* results: Do hashtags really make a difference anymore? Does video length matter as much as people say? Are trending sounds actually important, or mostly irrelevant? Is posting often more important than posting “better” content? Are there things the algorithm clearly seems to favor for game dev content? If you’ve experimented with this and noticed any patterns (or mistakes to avoid), I’d really appreciate hearing about it. submitted by /u/Fit_Relative_81 [link] [comments]",

That's until you get sick of losing your row count every single time your phone screen locks, or get distracted like I do. So I built MyCrochetKit. You say \"next\" and the counter goes up. Say \"back\" to undo. Works offline. Free tier no account required. The app is live and working. That part I can do. The part I can't do is get anyone to use it. The crochet community is tight knit (had to). They don't respond well to ads or promo posts. Everything has to be organic. I'm not a developer not a marketer and honestly figuring out distribution has been harder than building the thing. By nature I'm an addict so the hustle is in me, but that's in the streets this is way different. If anyone has gone through the \"it works but nobody knows\" phase I'd genuinely love to hear what moved the needle for you.

The \"beard\" appeared because the eyes and mouth are two different meshes (that use a flipbook to change expressions). The meshes had different normals along the cheek line and this created a distinct line in Unity. To fix it, I added a DataTransfer modifier the mouth section in Blender. It used the eye section as a source, found the closest matching vertex, and copied its normal value. When I exported the mesh back to Unity, the line disappeared.

      "content": "So this is my latest issue. I feel I have an understanding of creating a MetaHuman, bringing it into ZBrush and back to Unreal for rigging it up. But what I want to do now is to create my character with clothes, and gear and in doing so I'm wondering about the approach to take. when watching game models, if they wear pants and boots, the legs and feet have been deleted. I suppose it's for both performance and also penetration problems. so with MetaHuman, how would I achieve this? Do I have a Maya Master file with my rigged character and all clothes and gear rigged up. And for each outfit, I would delete the parts of the body that is covered up and export each outfit as a version like \"char_alex_supersuit\" then another like \"char_alex_pants_shirt\" etc. or do I keep everything in one file so I have a full body, then variants of this body with legs and torso deleted, maybe one with only the head depending on what outfit it goes with. then in Unreal I then hide/show these models, but I only have it all in one character. Also, when it comes to skinning (I'm using Maya) the different garments, should I just select all joints and \"Skin to Selected Joints\", then using transfer weights from MH body to my garment? submitted by /u/Dagobert_Krikelin [link] [comments]",

      "content": "I'm designing a casual, social CCG - it's not 'MtG with a twist' but for the sake of clarity, imagine you're playing MtG. But you don't have any creatures in your deck. Instead, you have a side deck of creatures who are Neutral in terms of control and only proc based on conditions or played cards - each round you draw one and place it face up into a queue for the battlefield with a max of 3 cards, after which the queue is full and no more can be drawn. Active creature cards in play are in the 'battlefield', which will damage/heal players or induce effects depending on whether their Element/Attribute/Cost is referenced. Creatures leave the battlefield depending on a round timer, and if they leave on a player's turn the player can select a Queue card for the Battlefield. The Queue isn't necessary but adds some choice and anticipation/strategy opportunity. Now instead of creatures, imagine they're philosophers, tyrants, literary figures and they're all there to criticise your logic and heckle or execute you. Does this sound fun? Because it seems like one of the really fun things about games like this is getting a card in your hand , and then playing it with excruciating smugness . This format loses that particular element of fun and I don't know if the alternative format is actually interesting in terms of new opportunities or strategies - it just seems like ceding control/decision making but perhaps this is why it's imagined as a more casual game. submitted by /u/Planar_Harold [link] [comments]",

I want OneDrive 100% banished from my PC forever without losing any files. How do I make this happen? submitted by /u/qzwxecrvtbyn111 to r/24hoursupport [link] [comments]",

      "content": "So, I’ve been wanting to get into game development for a while now and I’m eager to learn all the mechanics of creating a well made game. But I am terrible at 3d modeling but I found a Japanese style pack that fit my idea for the game and was wondering if it’s considered bad to use pre made assets for all the items. everything else would be up to me tho, because I have such a specific idea for the game I’m gonna hand make all the animations, HUDs, fighting and special moves. basically everything that’s not a visual item, I will be hand making. So is it considered bad to do that? and are you allowed to sell a game that uses pre made assets? submitted by /u/DapperOJack1 [link] [comments]",

If you ask me for the prettiest girl in the world do you want to be her or just date with her ı would definetely choose to be in her body. ıf ı have a button to make me a pretty woman ı would press it. and ı dont know if its relevant to that but ı always choose female characters in video games , but not primarily because ı feel like them but ı prefer to look at lara croft than bald spartan :)... about my self perception ı dont feel like ı am in a wrong body but ı simply prefer to see a thing in mirror ı attracted to.. thanks for your answers submitted by /u/AbbreviationsDeep437 to r/trans [link] [comments]",

I didn't even have time to post or upload a profile pic or do literally anything. They demanded a selfie to prove it's me which is bullshit. I had no posts on there. How does that make sense?

And that reminded me: I myself have a birthmark in the shape of a butterfly, and that inspired me to make some sort of Desnan emissary for my next character. I'm not sure whether I want to play a nephilim character or not, since I think a versatile heritage is just more fun to play in an Ancestry Paragon game, and that ruleset hasn't been brought up to the remaster, so I'd like to know if there's any further lore about birthmarks and what they mean/how they're interpreted in the world of Golarion. Just hoping to get some more character concept inspiration and to learn some new lore. Thx :) submitted by /u/DarkMoon250 to r/Pathfinder_RPG [link] [comments]",

The only time they seem to be there for each other is when its time to save someone or kill something. I've heard the books are better for expanding the friendship/bond but these guys are just miserable to be around in these formats. I dont understand why they are portrayed in this way.

      "content": "Hello everyone, new aspiring VTuber here. I have a question for both viewers and creators in this community: How do I align model to my personality as a VTuber? And how much does it really matter? I feel like it's partially something you figure out as you stream/create videos as a VTuber, but at the same time, wouldn't rebranding feel confusing to the viewer? I had an idea for my vtuber design long before I tried streaming for the first time, but I'm a little bit hesitant now. VTubers, have you ever been unsure about what kind of model (or better say character) would work best for you at the beginning of your path? Viewers, have you experienced a VTuber you watch go through a rebranding and if yes, how did you feel about it? Let me know your thoughts, please 🙏 I'm gonna attach my character design and tell a bit about myself, and you can be the judge of whether the design is fitting: Hi, I'm CyberTiger, I also go by Cyberchuff 🐯⚠️ I make videos irl and recently started streaming as a VTuber. I'd say most of what I do sits somewhere between creativity and tech: I like filming, editing, drawing and experimenting with all sorts of stuff. I tried making music a while ago and now I'm on my path of learning programming, where I have a few goals: 1. Create a RPG Maker game like Omori; 2. Create my personal Al assistant that would run locally on my pc (think of Chihiro's Alter Ego from Danganronpa: THH) I like trying things I've never done before just cuz I get bored of what I did before and to challenge myself with some ✨️new shiny activity✨️ I'm also an ENTP on a more introverted side of a spectrum if you're familiar with 16 personalities. Moral alignment irl: Chaotic Neutral, although I tend to get all deep and philosophical on streams for no fucking reason. Favorite emojis: 😎, 👁👄👁, 👀, ☝️🤓, 🤡, 🤔, 🫠, 🗿. Another important thing I probably should mention is what king of streams I want to do. As it is for right now, I'm streaming my design drawing process, but I'd also want to try streaming some programming and games. First in line are Project Zomboid, Omori, and Baldurs Gate 3 (if my pc will survive it), maybe some dbd with viewers, friends, viewers and friends, viewers who are friends etc etc. For now I'm just figuring a lot of stuff out, and I'm so small there's noone to notice if I'm to change stuff. BE THE JUDGE but plz be gentle. submitted by /u/cyberchuff to r/VirtualYoutubers [link] [comments]",

As a heads up to how much the game has earned up until now (6 months in), It's life changing money for me, but in the videos I mention below I just talk about the first month in the hopes that maybe it can stir something in some of you to either continue developing your games/apps or maybe even start it as a hobby like I did. I released my hobby project Bricks Breaker RPG with no previous dev experience. It's been a life-changing and I never in a million years thought that a hobby could end up this way after such a short time. It took me 18 months to code the game and I managed to finally release it on Android and iOS a few months ago. The Android release grossed $11,165.00 in the first month and iOS Grossed $2,765.00 I have a couple of videos that I can share with you if you ask that talk a little about the individual releases. The TLDR is that I didn't promote the game outside of Reddit really, I tried a few ads here and there but ultimately they were a waste of money. I wish there was a secret formula to success launches but I honestly think if the game/app is good enough, that's most of the hard work done.

As a heads up to how much the game has earned up until now (6 months in), It's life changing money for me, but in the videos I mention below I just talk about the first month in the hopes that maybe it can stir something in some of you to either continue developing your games/apps or maybe even start it as a hobby like I did. I released my hobby project Bricks Breaker RPG with no previous dev experience. It's been a life-changing and I never in a million years thought that a hobby could end up this way after such a short time. It took me 18 months to code the game and I managed to finally release it on Android and iOS a few months ago. The Android release grossed $11,165.00 in the first month and iOS Grossed $2,765.00 I have a couple of videos that I can share with you if you ask that talk a little about the individual releases. The TLDR is that I didn't promote the game outside of Reddit really, I tried a few ads here and there but ultimately they were a waste of money.

This is double as true with many “big comebacks”. Patriots fans or fans in general had to watch the Falcons blow them out for 30 minutes. Falcons fans had to watch them get blown out for 30 minutes. There was no tension between back and forth scoring with a close game where each score where the teams are on a tight rope constantly pulling the rope under their opponent. Also this only just highlighted how terrible the OT rules were, making the end only as tragic. MVP had to sit and watch their defense lose.

      "content": "Hi, I'm creating an Asteroids game in Godot and I wanted to recreate the highscore the arcade machines had, in which you enter 3 letters representing your name and your highscore gets saved. I wanted to replicate that in the game so I create a LineEdit Node and give it code to restrict his output. I give it a max_lenght of 3 so it only shows 3 letters. The thing is that I want that the only valid characters the user can write are letters (and maybe numbers) so I searched how can i do that and I found about the RegEx class and after a time looking what it does, I write this code on the _on_text_changed method. The code is from other people that had the same problem as me. Howewer, I had two big problems with this: - The first one is that the code doesn't work. It's supossed to look into the text and check if all the letters fit the pattern of the const ALLOWED_CHARACTERS. But for some reason it does not do it at all. - The second problem is that for some reason sometimes when I run the scene, my screen freezes and does not let me do anything. It's weird because sometimes does not happen but also sometimes does so its a bit weird. While I was writing this I thought that maybe in this case the problem is inside the _on_text_change_rejected. The point of that is to replicate the behaviour of the arcade machines, when if you put a fourth letter when you have already wrote three of them (for example: \"ABC\"), it pushes the two last letters to the left and adds the new one to the right (In this example, \"ABC\" transforms into \"BCD\" in the case I pressed the \"D\" keyword). My point is that maybe because the method is changing the text, it can change the behaviour of the _on_text_changed method, but i'm not sure. That's why I ask for help, can you tell me what exactly the problem in my code? I would aprecciate any help. submitted by /u/anchoasada [link] [comments]",

      "content": "I made a plugin (with the help of chat gpt) to add a confetti effect on rpg maker MZ And as it works well (I didn't notice any bug but it's not impossible that there are some) I wanted to share it. You can find it on this page https://www.rpg-maker.fr/scripts-587-confettis-sur-la-map.html (the article is in french but the plugin is in english) It's not very hard to use (translation of the article) : Just put your confetti images in /img/pictures, enable the plugin, then go to: \"Plugin Command\" → Confetti.js → play and set your parameters: Images → the names of your confetti images, separated by commas, for example: Confetti1, Confetti2 X → the position at the top of the screen where you want your confetti to appear. Example: 0 for the top left, or 408 for the center if your screen width is 816px. Spawn Width (top) → the width at the top of the screen where the confetti will spawn. Example: if your screen is 816px wide, setting 816 will launch confetti across the full width of the screen. Bottom Spread → the width of the confetti spread at the bottom. Example: if your screen is 816px wide, setting 816 will spread the confetti across the full width. Amount → the number of confetti pieces. The higher the number, the more confetti you get (be careful — above 50 starts to get heavy; between 1 and 10 is good). Duration → how long the confetti is emitted, for example 60 for 60 frames (1 second). Exemple the settings in the gif are : X → 480 (my game's window is 960 px wide) Spawn Width (top) → 24 Bottom Spread → 480 Amount → 2 Duration → 90 That’s it!

I have a good graphics card and a good PC overall. (So that you don’t say it might be my PC not being powerful enough, I’ve seen people with very good computers and they also have poor performance.) There are games with good graphics that are well optimized both for mobile and PC. In version 2.0 the game was perfect; you implemented the shader (which is good), but I don’t think it should be difficult to improve optimization if you assign a team to each task. It’s a good game, but I feel that if they don’t fix all these issues, it will gradually have fewer players. I just wanted to make this post so it can help and we can get them to improve it. submitted by /u/ochre13 to r/WutheringWaves [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Hi, this is our first post here! We are a small indie team of two. We have been working on a project called Stack Order, and since we just launched our Steam page, we wanted to share the design philosophy behind it to see if it can interest anyone! We wanted to bring back the feeling of physicality found in TCGs like magic or yu-gi-oh where the order in which cards resolve is a puzzle in itself. In Stack Order, you don't just play cards into a void. You have distinct slots (Attack, Defense, Special) where you physically pile up your cards. When you activate a stack, cards resolve from the top down. This means a card placed at the top happens before a card placed at the bottom. Example: If you place a \"Wound\" card after an Attack card, it’s useless because the attack resolves first and won't be amplified by the wound. You have to physically place the Wound card on top of the Attack for the combo to work when you will trigger all the cards from top to bottom. Also, the Bosses you face explicitly telegraphs their intent (for example: Will deal 10 special damages), so your turn isn't just about playing your strongest cards but it's about building a clever stacks that will have a use in 2/3 turns when you'll need an answer. We are also huge fans of graphic novels, so we are animating the entire game by hand (2D animation) to make the game feel like a living comic book. If this sounds like your kind of jam, checking out the Steam page helps us a lot! Steam Link: https://store.steampowered.com/app/4338750/Stack_Order/ We would also be very happy to answer any questions you may have about the game or discuss it with you!

      "content": "Credit to u/ZealousidealPlay3183 for finding this. As many of you know, Jeffrey Epstein played videogames. He got banned from Xbox Live due to harassment and he discussed about COD and micro transactions with important figures on activision. However, there is a compelling theory that he played Fortnite and his account username was 'littlestjeff1', same as his youtube account (referencing the dreadful island which he nicknamed 'Little St Jeff'). I've watched a few Instagram reels discussing this and ~1 hour ago I decided to take a look. The account appeared to have changed its flag to the Israeli flag (I took the screenshot to send to my friend. Might have been one of the luckiest things I did as the account is now private on fortnite tracker). The account did show some hours of gameplay back in Chapter 1 Season 3, which must mean it was created as early as April 2018. More importantly, it did show gameplay in several recent seasons (2023 and 2024). From my point of view, this must mean one of three things: Someone created this account with this username back in 2018, but it's simply a coincidence and it comes down to chance. Jeffrey Epstein created this account and has been using it recently, meaning he is alive Jeffrey Epstein created this account, but he has not had access to it since his last arrest. If someone is using it, it's someone with access to the account (maybe a hacker or someone with access to the console he used to play or his Epic Games account). Out of the 3, I feel like 2 is the most convincing one. Still don't know what to make of the Israeli flag on his profile submitted by /u/RocketsDitto to r/Epstein [link] [comments]",

I personally liked the `animation player + animation tree` approach the most, so what's the best way to move a character and make the animations work? submitted by /u/BBeyondSky [link] [comments]",

I challenged myself this year to work on a project so i've been planning it out and I wanted to do a collectathon style game using godot4. So far I have been coding movement mechanics, camera etc. But I want to start blocking out a level but I have no clue where to begin in terms a physically making a blockout. In terms of concept art and drawings its fine but how do I physically blockout a level? Do i do it all in blender? CSG in godot4? What practices should I be using to block out things like slopes or cliffs etc. The problem with most tutorials i've watched is they alwsys talk about \"make corridors that direct thr player\" but with the design I am hoping to do is something more open like fields or beaches or somehing like that Any guidance would be appreciated. submitted by /u/RamuneGaming to r/leveldesign [link] [comments]",

But for some reason inZOI always has this microstutter that never gone. I even deleted AMD adrenaline software to get the 'buttery smooth' experience (it did, a little bit but stutter still there). I was already thinking of swapping my RX 9060 XT 16GB to 5060 Ti 16GB but the price difference... But then I found out the reason it stuttered so much was because of SmartZoi. Right after I turned it off, the lag went away. A bit disappointing though, I really like the feature, it made me enjoy the game more. But as long as I can drive without crashing into other cars, I guess I'll keep it off until maybe dev optimises smartzoi with amd gpu 🥲 submitted by /u/sorrymaam28 to r/inZOI [link] [comments]",

      "content": "I’m in 10th grade, and have zero friends. I’ve been growing up with the same kids for years and yet I’m not friends with any of them. Bask in elementary I had so many friends, went to their house, played games, had a nice group of friends at school, and I had pretty much all my friends since elementary since one by one we all started slipping apart. A lot of the friend groups I once had we strayed away because of covid. We were school friends but didn’t have each others number, so that’s definitely why. In 5th and 6th, I still had a few good friend, and still had one friend I would consider my best friend and he would say it too. We would play games almost every night. But then 8th grade came and we got no classes toghether. We still talked but he started losing interest in games, and his parents never let him stay over at my house or his some reason. In 8th grade it was the first grade where I genuinely felt completely alone. I didn’t make any friends, every single grade before this I could recall at least 1 friend I made, but this was the first time it wasn’t. And my best friend had way more important things in life that got in the way of playing games so we strayed apart. All of my friends from elementary, who moved away but I still had their numbers, also strayed away around this time, and especially one, who was my best friend from when I was 8, we kinda just stopped talking. Every time I go to him he’s always playing with his own friend and I can never join. He always seems to have some excuse to not playing and I text him first every time. 10th grade and I’m even more isolated. I join a few clubs but I’m sitting in the corner, seeing everyone have somewhere by their side or someone that follows them, and I have no one. I see new kids that transfers schools get so many friends, so I have realized that it is 100% me. I can’t have 1 interaction where in sweating afterward. I struggle to say “hi” to someone. And I go to people in my schools TikTok’s and they have so many friends. I hace zero. One “friend” I went to his house and he was very dry. When I opened the door he didn’t even say hi or smile or anything he literally just looked at me and then walked away, and he clearly didnt want me to be there. I tried starting any conversations but he answered dryly. Every time I try to spark a conversation with him in class he gives usually a dry answer, and if I say nothing to him in class, he doesn’t either. And now it’s even worse he literally acts as if I don’t exist, and then I see him messing and joking and rough housing with his other friends. Same goes for every single other friend. What am I doing wrong??? Not one person ever texts me first ever since this year. What am I doing wrong and I just want friends like genuinely I almost cried at my club bc I was sitting while everyone else was socializing and I was too scared to say anything bc they’re gonna be like “omg that kid talked omg omg” and I know it. Literally 1 best friend at school just 1 is all I want. I know a group of kids who seem nice and I think I want to be friends with them, especially one guy because he’s been nice to me before. But I’m too scared and he’s not following me online. How do I get over social anxiety it’s ruining my life submitted by /u/Fickle-Work-1225 to r/school [link] [comments]",

My experiences have been so unnecessarily heavy, that I gets to a point that I don't know if I have the capacity to enjoy pure beauty as it is. Almost like... I'll never see light as it is, but all the shadow casted in the corners as well. Personally, there is some weight to this perspective that just blur my own capacity to experience good. The sunset is still beautiful, nature is still majestic, adrenaline is still fuel, but how could I experiences those moments without the weight of my own life? I keep trying though... trying to experience just the good... but this might not be for me and I should embrace this process. Perhaps that's what I am supposed to offer to the next generation (my own family), a life where good is actually good, not just unrealized potential. Because I feel like all the good I see, is just brute potential, not reality. And there are no safe places around me, that holds space for genuine expression of good. I guess I am doomed to perceiving life with the same eyes that saw all the terror I met. Perhaps my children will live free of this nightmare...

      "content": "Hey everyone! Solo dev of Star Crust Excavations here with another update for you! I don't like to post unless I have something good to share, and I think this time is a really good one! Long story short, I've added random events to the game, which I think add a lot of depth to the core game loop. The video attached shows most of them, the black hole, cargo drone, and crust swarm (which is less a random event and more adjacent to random events) however there is one more where pirate drones attack and siphon your resources and disable your drones if you don't take them out. I've also made some balance updates to the mining drones, as well as how scanning works. This game has come a long way since I've first posted and has even more to go. Take a look at the Dev Log if you're interested in more of what I did this update or in any previous updates! And come play the game if you haven't already. It's for web, playable on desktop and mobile. I'm looking to do a Steam release in the future, more info on that outlined on my Discord! As always, thank you all for playing and for your feedback! submitted by /u/Disamble [link] [comments]",

I kinda just go off the top of my head but i kinda want like things i can fall back on to talk about forever, i make a lot of raunchy jokes as im an 18 plus stream. Also like to do lil silly voices and just being my lil bean self. Im getting a little overwhelmed on what to focus on or what things i should be moving toward next to better my streams.

      "content": "This is your sign to get a vr treadmill, especially if you’ve been watching reviews and YouTube demos but never pulling the trigger. I’ve been there 😅. I mostly play Skyrim VR, and mods are a big part of how I play. And once I added movement mods, combat tweaks, and expanded landscapes, joystick movement started feeling limiting. Physically walking, even in short steps, made exploration slower, more intentional, and way more immersive. It felt like actually being inside the world instead of just steering a character. Beyond immersion, the treadmill is a surprisingly good workout. You’re constantly moving your legs, balancing, and shifting weight, which adds up over a few hours. The Kat Walk C2 works well for me because it folds up easily and feels solid enough for long sessions. The harness spreads weight evenly, and noise and calibration make a huge difference. After tweaking it for my space, turning and strafing feel natural, and I can move safely without worrying about bumping into furniture. Before buying, I compared Amazon, eBay, direct brand sites, and even skimmed Alibaba just to see how different designs hold up. If you already care about immersion or want a fun way to add low-impact cardio, a vr treadmill closes the gap between gaming and exercise.

      "content": "Hey Salesforce devs! 👋 Have you checked out the latest Spring ’26 release? It’s pretty exciting—now you can perform GraphQL mutations right inside your Lightning Web Components using the executeMutation function from lightning/graphql . I used to juggle between GraphQL reads and update/delete through Apex or lightning/uiRecordApi , which sometimes felt like keeping data flows out of sync. But now, with Spring ’26, it’s possible to keep all CRUD operations in one neat GraphQL flow! The exampleLWC pattern in particular shows how you can load accounts, edit inline, create, update, or delete records—and keep your UI refreshed consistently from the same source of truth. This means less code complexity and improved data accuracy, especially for apps relying heavily on reactive data and rich UI summaries. If you're building Salesforce apps with LWC and GraphQL, this could be a game changer for managing data reactively and imperatively. Has anyone tried this out in their projects yet? What’s your take on unifying read/write GraphQL flows like this? Check out the full post here: https://lenguyensf.blog/2026/02/04/spring-26-graphql-mutations-in-lwc-using-examplelwc-as-a-practical-pattern/ SalesforceDev #LightningWebComponents #GraphQL #Spring26 #SalesforceLightning submitted by /u/leeseifer to u/leeseifer [link] [comments]",

There's a ton of data to handle with all the affixes, crafting options, slots, and how everything connects to the rest of the planner.

I knew it would make early game harder but mid to late game easier. I expected that I’d need this because how else would I beat bosses? Well, after 300 hours it became evident that max 300 made mid to late game lose all tension. Nothing was a threat anymore in the wild on land short of a wild Giga or carcha. You simply were too higher leveled. And for some reason making wild creatures higher level makes loot way way better. Why? Idk. But all I ever found is Mastercraft and ascendant gear and saddles. The world could no longer push back. Also, Ragnarok seems very unbalanced. That ice cave in particular is so broken: allowing flyers to go in to easy high tier loot over and over.

      "content": "I barely have any game dev experience so bare with me. So I'm implementing player controls in my game and now I'm probably overthinking about stuff that'll come later. All the tutorials put the player control script in their player node. This doesn't make any problems when the project is a tiny tutorial. But now I'm thinking about what'll happen once I have multiple elements that will take in inputs. For example a UI element that uses arrow keys. That would use the same inputs as my player, so it would have to override the controls. My first thought was that it could make sense to have some sort of central script that handles all controls and inputs. Although I'm guessing that's not an optimal solution, because of modularity or some shit. I think the solution is to just write the scripts so that any element that needs to override the controls does that by itself. So for example if you open a menu, that UI scene is loaded and it has a script that stops the player controls from working while the menu is open. How is this stuff usually done? I get stuck thinking about this kind of stuff at every step of development. I probably should just make the game and not stop at every step. I'll post this anyway. Maybe one of you will say something that gives me a lot of clarity. submitted by /u/Vylez [link] [comments]",

He weighed 731 pounds, served as a town marshal without a gun, and once shoved a burning safe to safety with his bare hands. But in Farmersville, Texas, they remember Sam Harris for one thing above all: his heart. In the early 1900s, Sam Harris wasn’t a spectacle. He wasn’t a sideshow attraction; he was simply Big Sam , the gentle giant of Farmersville. Despite his enormous size, his legacy wasn’t built on his strength but on his kindness and quiet presence. After surviving typhoid fever as a boy, Sam grew into a man who could have easily been isolated, but instead, he rooted himself in his community. As town marshal, he kept the peace not by force, but by being a steady, calming presence. When a local business caught fire, Sam, without hesitation, walked into the flames and pushed a 2,000-pound safe to safety with his bare hands. Sam’s life wasn’t marked by his size, but by the way he made others feel. He traveled through town in a custom buggy pulled by two white mules, always tipping his hat to neighbors. On summer days, he would float in the river, and his children would use his chest as a diving platform. Despite his fame—he was a fixture in parades, a member of fraternal orders, and even featured in Ripley’s Believe It or Not! —at home, he was simply “Big Sam.” A devoted father and a man made mostly of heart. When he died in 1931, thousands gathered to honor him. A custom-built casket was carried on a flatbed truck through town, and mourners followed not to gawk, but to mourn a friend. Sam’s grave in Farmersville Cemetery serves as a reminder that true greatness isn’t measured in pounds or feats of strength. It’s in the quiet moments of grace, the kindness that outlasts the legends, and the way we make space for others in our lives. His legacy, carved not in stone but in the hearts of those who knew him, teaches us that the largest legacy isn’t written in stature—it’s written in the weight of our character. •Please pray for those who dedicate their lives to helping• “Whoever pursues righteousness and love finds life, prosperity and honor.” Proverbs 21:21.

      "content": "I barely have any game dev experience so bare with me. So I'm implementing player controls in my game and now I'm probably overthinking about stuff that'll come later. All the tutorials put the player control script in their player node. This doesn't make any problems when the project is a tiny tutorial. But now I'm thinking about what'll happen once I have multiple elements that will take in inputs. For example a UI element that uses arrow keys. That would use the same inputs as my player, so it would have to override the controls. My first thought was that it could make sense to have some sort of central script that handles all controls and inputs. Although I'm guessing that's not an optimal solution, because of modularity or some shit. I think the solution is to just write the scripts so that any element that needs to override the controls does that by itself. So for example if you open a menu, that UI scene is loaded and it has a script that stops the player controls from working while the menu is open. How is this stuff usually done? I get stuck thinking about this kind of stuff at every step of development. I probably should just make the game and not stop at every step. I'll post this anyway. Maybe one of you will say something that gives me a lot of clarity. submitted by /u/Vylez to r/godot [link] [comments]",

      "content": "(Do people even read these??) I had these 4 in minds : New camera mechanics - Both spectating and only getting to view the back of ur bot is getting kinda old..Pixo needs to add camera angles and such. We also need the most obvious thing.... FREE CAM. Some people get creative when it comes to freecam, doing some sick edits/gameplay with it. It would be amazing if they added these things. They should also make the UI invisible when we are in free cam and in different angle (or they could have a setting specialised for it) Dgems to Resource - When it comes to dgems, some people spend them and then somehow get left with 10 or less of these precious digital cubes. The idea is, when players have 10 or LESS dgems, they can convert them to resources, such as silvers,golds,modules and so on. These would make those un-spendable dgems come to hands.. Specialisation - I know this might sound useless, but this gives an advantage to SOME peoples....Anywho, The ability to ENABLE/DISABLE specialisation is quite handy when it comes to testing and other *stuff* ADS - I know it, you know it, we ALL know it..The ads are quite, sad..Fake gameplays, some *questionable* ones and as such. The ads NEEDS to be FIXED, that's when free cam stuff comes in handy...The pictures in Google Play also needs to be replaced with TRUE gameplays.. Converting Special Editions to normal versions (this would never make it to the game as it is kinda bs) - Some people (js SOME people) ​prefer design over damage (like ME). They should make it so we can obviously convert Special editions to normal versions with a cost of golds or silvers?. This wont do any advantage besides having lesser damages... I hope pixo reads dis (ofc not) especially for the specialisation and camera mechanics things. Thanks for reading and lmk what would be the disadvantages of one of these ideas :D submitted by /u/Frryx to r/walkingwarrobots [link] [comments]",

      "content": "1. I suggest resetting the PK count and Arena Rating (AR) on a monthly basis in order to encourage players to keep participating in PvP, instead of benefiting from a high rating and then avoiding fights to prevent losing it. For a more motivating experience, it would be great to add an in-game menu that displays these rankings, with sorting options by class, while still keeping a Top 50 players leaderboard. I believe this system could help create new legends within the game, similar to what we used to see in classic MMORPGs, where competition and reputation truly mattered. 2. I hope the dev considers adding a new PvP mode with a large-scale, team-based focus. Once every hour, players could enter a war zone through a portal and be randomly assigned to one of two teams, with no player limit per side. Each team would defend its own boss while trying to defeat the enemy team’s boss first. This kind of mode could be a great addition for endgame players, especially for those who find traditional dungeons too repetitive (myself included). It would offer a fresh, dynamic alternative that encourages coordination, large battles, and replayability. Wars can last for 30 minutes, every hour. If there would be many players in each team (no level restriction or player number restriction), maybe would be better that mages and rangers can have AOEs in this PvP mode 🤔. Clerics will heal and shield etc., while paladins can make engages, through their spell when they run to enemy and stun it. I think that would be a cool implementation, and not very difficult to code, and a good reason to make people stay in the game and chill as endgamers. submitted by /u/HourNeedleworker688 to r/Dreadmyst [link] [comments]",

Nah, VPNs did not work during that time and won't since they just pull the plug to the outside world. I wanted to ask, is it possible to trick the Minecraft Bedrock client to think it's still logged in or just enable entry to the servers tab regardless? Not sure where I should have written this post but since it's leaning towards Piracy in a way, thought it'd be safer here. Any ideas what to do during a blackout besides downloading PojavLauncher?

Easiest comparison is to the recoiless rifle which has 6 total ammo while the breaching hammer has 8 charges. The breaching hammer one taps most things with some exceptions like factory striders and hive lords lol. The breaching hammer also doesnt require a backpack If you look at just the values than yeah the breachinh hammer is extremely good But I dont think some people realise how tricky using melee weapons in this game is. Not only can you not kill flying enemies you also have to come close to an enemy which is usualy pretty risky. Dont get me wrong I am not saying that the breaching hammer is bad. It is really good especialy for a melee weapon in this game. I just think some people overhype it making it seem like it is extremely overpowered.

      "content": "I am working on a mobile game and digging deeper into performance decisions, especially around real-time shadows. I always assumed shadows were a “must-have” for visual grounding. But as we’ve started profiling on actual devices, it’s become pretty clear how expensive shadows are on mobile, especially with skinned characters and anything targeting stable 60 FPS. I have also just learned more about how common auto-tuning / device-tiering actually is (auto-detecting hardware and applying different quality tiers at runtime). That got me thinking differently about the problem. So I’m curious how senior / experienced mobile devs approach this today: -Do you consider real-time shadows necessary on mobile? -Or are shadows more of a luxury feature that should be reserved for higher-tier devices only? -Is it reasonable to completely disable shadows on low- and mid-tier devices, and only enable them (at modest quality) on mid-to-high / flagship devices? Right now I’m leaning toward -Low tier: no shadows -Mid tier: no shadows -High tier: medium-quality environment shadows only Gameplay readability and performance stability matter more to me than visual fidelity, but I don’t want to make the game feel flat if shadows are considered important. Would love to hear how others are handling this in real production. Especially what players actually notice vs. what we think they notice. submitted by /u/build_logic [link] [comments]",

But then it stroke us. Maybe we were too focused on the game development itself. Making the interactions perfect. Making the animations perfect. Making everything perfect inside a project that doesn't have any audience. I guess we could call it a rookie mistake. Now we know wishlists won't come out of nowhere. Especially not while the game is only presented through pictures and a video. Previously, our branding was based on a \"1-hour job\" with the goal \"Just get it out there\". Didn't work. Therefore, now we started looking into re-branding of, what we believe, is a great game with a lot of potential. Before Branded as a detective horror game. You play as a detective that has to uncover the truth. After Branded as a full on horror game with a side quest as a detective. Go out there with your friends. Scream on a Discord call. Explore the ever-changing maps. Your detective lobby is just a funny place with Easter Eggs. Throw toilet paper and beer bottles at your friends. Then move to search the scary locations. From boring to exciting. I'm attaching a visual of the most important element on the Steam page - Our Header capsule. What do you think?

This doesn’t make sense though if they have actual songs from our universe made probably 10-20 years after that, but if they split in the 60s wouldn’t their technology, pre-war clothes, and overall aesthetic have looked different?

      "content": "I am working on a mobile game and digging deeper into performance decisions, especially around real-time shadows. I always assumed shadows were a “must-have” for visual grounding. But as we’ve started profiling on actual devices, it’s become pretty clear how expensive shadows are on mobile, especially with skinned characters and anything targeting stable 60 FPS. I have also just learned more about how common auto-tuning / device-tiering actually is (auto-detecting hardware and applying different quality tiers at runtime). That got me thinking differently about the problem. So I’m curious how senior / experienced mobile devs approach this today: -Do you consider real-time shadows necessary on mobile? -Or are shadows more of a luxury feature that should be reserved for higher-tier devices only? -Is it reasonable to completely disable shadows on low- and mid-tier devices, and only enable them (at modest quality) on mid-to-high / flagship devices? Right now I’m leaning toward -Low tier: no shadows -Mid tier: no shadows -High tier: medium-quality environment shadows only Gameplay readability and performance stability matter more to me than visual fidelity, but I don’t want to make the game feel flat if shadows are considered important. Would love to hear how others are handling this in real production. Especially what players actually notice vs. what we think they notice. submitted by /u/build_logic [link] [comments]",

      "content": "I was really hyped for Menace (maybe even over hyped) but in the end it's just not for me, and here's why: The systems seem complex and the game doesn't do a good job of informing me of how they work. There are no damage previews, so it's hard to make a informed decision about what to do. Units are extremely slow, mission objectives are far away, and there is very little cover to move between. You don't get anything for saving your action points either. There's no overwatch mechanic or bonus AP on the next turn, so if I don't move them to the full extent of their ability, it kinda feels like a waste. The basic infantry guns barely even tickle the enemy. They just feel bad to use. Maybe it focuses more on \"realism\" but I think in general I prefer more arcade style strategy games like XCOM or Into the Breach. submitted by /u/Openly_Gamer to r/StrategyRpg [link] [comments]",

In the version I'm building, I've integrated an API that pulls official F1 data (like the stuff you see in the video) to help decide on Race Partners (sponsors picked but change every). For example, instead of just picking a sponsor and hoping for the best, the game has a \"Data Centre\" where you can: Compare Driver Telemetry: See side-by-side speed traces for two drivers to see who actually has the better pace vs the top 10 and 11th-15th. Track Tyre Age/Compounds: View exactly how many laps your driver’s current set has done. Targeted Payouts: Use this data to choose specific \"Race Partners\" like the Apex Double Top 10: Pays if both your drivers finish in the points . https://preview.redd.it/p4jcb6mq1yhg1.png?width=1150&format=png&auto=webp&s=8893b27e30fd87f77056b8bd1bc3fec86e270e69 The idea is to move away from \"set and forget\" teams and actually use the Friday/Saturday data to \"lock in\" your sponsorship strategy for Sunday. Does this level of depth appeal to you as a fantasy player, or do you prefer the more casual approach of the official app?

      "content": "Let's say my artwork is designed at 320x180. It's a 2D game. The game is ultimately going to be played on 1920x1080 screens (6x difference). What is the right way to handle this? Should I be... scaling up each sprite node 6x in godot so that the game is built at 1920x1080. build the game pixel-perfect and let the window size scale it? building the game at pixel-perfect scale, then scaling up the entire game in a subviewport node? build the game at the native 1920x1080 size and just saving out all the sprites and graphics at 6x Or something else? I'm finding that if I make the game at pixel perfect scale, I can sometimes see flashes of gaps between graphics when scaled up, unless I check the pixel \"snap\" options in my project settings. However, this leads to slower animations looking jagged and star-steppy. I'm kinda leaning toward just saving my graphics at 6x to avoid these issues. And that will also give me the option to render things at higher resolution as-needed, like fonts. submitted by /u/dylanmadigan [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Built a universal screen translator (OCR + Python) Hey everyone I wanted to share a hackathon project I’ve been working on called Lingo-Live . It’s a desktop app that translates any text on your screen , even when the text isn’t selectable — like: text inside images YouTube videos game dialogue or error messages foreign-language UI elements I kept running into this problem myself and got tired of manually typing things out or using phone-based OCR, so I decided to build a proper desktop solution. How it works: You press a hotkey Select an area of the screen OCR extracts the text The translation appears instantly in a floating, glass-style overlay The app is built in Python , uses OCR under the hood, and focuses on staying lightweight and unobtrusive while you’re working or gaming. Demo video (1 min): https://youtu.be/YRHfRc4_d3s Source code: https://github.com/Samar-365/lingo_live This is still a work in progress, and I’m actively improving it, so I’d really appreciate: feature suggestions UX feedback ideas for real-world use cases Happy to answer any questions about the implementation as well.

I have a few ideas of games I'd want to make, but there have been some barriers. What kind of microtransactions are there, if any?

I’ve already tried a few times, but it usually ends with either FPS drops or the game crashing. I’m not using a huge mod list — around 20 to maybe 30 mods at most. The problem is, I don’t really understand load order on console, which mods overwrite others, or which combinations can cause issues. There are also a few mods that always move themselves to the top of the load order no matter what I do, even after saving, which makes it even more confusing. Below is the list of mods I’d like to use. I’m not sure if they work well together, if some of them conflict, or how I should order them properly on PS5. I’m not really looking to add more mods — I just want these to work as stable as possible.

I think you should HAVE to pick one pilot and three infantry leaders to start, and everyone should start out with max squadies, and equipped with the starter equipment Especially the car and it's gun. That might put you over the cap depending on the crew you take, but simply make it so the cap is at the max a new player could possibly have. Aside from that is the decision on what leaders to take specifically. Aside from the lore blurb, an assessment summarizing the strengths of the leader and how they can develop would be great. Mousing over all the badges is not intuitive and also too time consuming for someone who doesn't really know the game yet. It might even be better to take the choice away from players at first and stick them with four specific leaders rather than give new players decision paralysis right at the start. submitted by /u/Corka to r/menace [link] [comments]",

This would also impact the lore because Nibbler is omniscient and knows how every ritual will end. He sees in an alternate universe that the opposing patron's court would destroy the world with their newfound power and status, and that's why he is fighting. Also everyone else on the team is surprised that Nibbler can talk because they all knew each other and were friends before because of course. Nibbler is cute. Who wouldn't want to be friends with him? But after the game, they all forget he can talk and have their memory of the ritual wiped. Anyway this is my headcanon.

      "content": "Today I decided since all my friends are currently playing in a 4-stack without me and I was getting tired of killer after 2 hours to try some Solo Queue. First match I spawn in Eerie with The Ghoul. Ghoul appears to be decently new, but he does understand gen pressure and when to drop chase. They left me multiple times when I led them away from gens. After about 14 minutes we lose a teammate before the last gen can pop, but we keep rotating 2/3 of the last gen. After a while the three of us get out. Then as I'm typing out \"GG\" this lovely message comes up right before I hit enter. I don't know any of these people here, and none of this is even close to genrush. You can even tell by the point distribution that genrushing wasn't happening here as then the points would be in the teens or less for basically everyone. I'm hoping they learn more about the game and also switch up their build to better counter what they consider to be gen rushing. submitted by /u/luigind123 to r/DeadByDaylightRAGE [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Valve's upcoming Steam Machine faces significant delays and unexpected price increases due to soaring RAM and storage component costs, forcing the company to revisit its schedule and pricing. Analysts predict the 512GB model could now start at $700-1000, with the 2TB version potentially hitting $1300-$1500, far exceeding initial targets. Experts warn that a price exceeding $700 could be a \"death sentence\" for sales, as Valve, unlike larger console makers, lacks the negotiating power to absorb these rising costs. This pricing challenge primarily threatens the Steam Machine's ability to expand its user base beyond its established PC enthusiast audience.

Learn to travel alone. Watch movies alone. Play. There is so much that can only be done in your solitude. And this is what will make you strong, fulfilled, and complete from within.

      "content": "I think that CSS should make it so you have the option to transfer blueprints from saves into another save. You could go into the settings and have blueprint share/transfer on or off. Choose what save to share from or have them all share. When in the blueprint section it is in a folder labeled from the save name or a name chosen by you (like how you can edit the folders already). from. And if you make the blueprints in a higher level blueprint maker they are locked until you unlock that level (if possible the game could measure how big the blueprint is if made in a mk2 or higher blueprint maker. And if it’s small enough to fit in a mk1 it’s unlocked before mk2 unlock.) I am just putting it out there so that the devs may see this and make it an official feature. Please upvote to support and comment any ideas with blueprint sharing. Or other discussions in the comments. I am aware pc can go into files and share blueprints but it would be nice for it to be an actual feature.

      "content": "Hey everyone, I'm building a PC for a friend, and we're having a lot of trouble with a potential DRAM issue. We had trouble with the old motherboard, and bought a brand new one factory sealed. But when we turn the PC on, the lights/fans/RGB turn on, but the DRAM light is a solid yellow , and stays on for at least 5 minutes. We have a ROG STRIX B550-F GAMING WIFI II and a Ryzen 9 5900X , with 32GB of DDR4 3600, in a Lian Li Vector V100R (including the case for reason below). This is everything I've tried so far: Tried reseating each stick of RAM, in each slot/configuration Tried with a confirmed working stick of RAM in each slot Checked the CPU for damaged/missing pins, or excess thermal paste in the socket Reseated the motherboard/CPU power cables, and checked the PSU connections Replaced the CMOS battery with a brand new and confirmed working CMOS battery Updated BIOS using the flashback feature on the motherboard Plugged in a PC speaker, no beeps or codes Checked for any stray standoffs in the case Now, the RAM, CPU, and SSD come from a prebuilt Alienware Aurora R10 . We used the motherboard from that PC to troubleshoot, and it booted perfectly. We also had a Gigabyte B550 AORUS ELITE AX V2 motherboard originally, with different issues but also not posting (we had good reason to think that one was just a bad board). I've tried literally everything. It can't be two bad motherboards back to back. If anyone knows what else to do, please help us out!

It was the first time doing something to a figure and am happy how it came out even though I was nervous to mess it up. I had to get the Silver Surfer and so I got two: the 6 inch and the retro 3.75. Both look amazing and even though I tried to do a perspective shot I just couldn’t do it without it looking fuzzy. So I did the next best thing which was to do separate shots and make the surfers smaller. I opted to do one shot for each surfer. I decided to make a shot that reflected to some degree what’s been going on and how the Surfer, being noble and righteous, helps people while Galactus, being amoral, just consumes planets for substance. I wanted that interaction of the Surfer pleading for the people of the world… submitted by /u/Nervous_Coast_77 to r/MarvelLegends [link] [comments]",

I played since November and now I can say for me this is one of the worst CODs I ever played. I haven’t played one since bo3 way back in 2016 and now I remember why. Which is sad because it can be a fun game. So do “older” ones still have players? Like mw2, mw3 etc you know? Sadly I can’t play bo6 anymore because every time I trie to start it and choose multiplayer it always says dev_error and people I’ve been playing with have the same issue.

      "content": "Not really a poster, but I’ve played RS since 2005, stopped playing for a year when EOC came out, but gave it a shot after some updates and stayed. I’ve completed MQC/Comp and very close to Trim now, so I’ve done most of the content in the game. I don’t think I play as optimally as all you professionals here because I barley used auras because I didn’t own them, but once I got them it felt like they were required or I wasn’t doing the content (big feels bad). I am definitely in favor of removing the time gating of the aura ability’s so I can do whatever where ever (with some nerfs for things that would make it broken ofc). Something I’ve been thinking about is how it would be implemented. After reading the updates/blogs, to me It seems like the direction they would head in is something like the archeology relics, or the permanent buff scrolls you can purchase from the dung shops. Maybe they could make an aura stand in the PoH update that we could sacrifice our auras to and change like relics? Maybe not for all of them…. Maybe they could make some into scrolls, buff dung xp from doing floors and make the skilling inside dungeons worth running floors with scrolls in the shops? Just spit balling but interested in what others were thinking could be done for auras. Edit: added I have completed MQC too submitted by /u/Solo-Zed to r/runescape [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Hi everyone, solo dev here 👋 I’ve been working on Dropletts for about 6 months and really excited to share it. It’s a word game where letters fall into a 5×5 grid and you build words to keep the board under control. The twist is that the board shrinks as you play: columns fill up, collapse, and never come back. The longer you survive, the less space and fewer letters you have to work with. Preorders are live now ahead of the March 12 launch (free to play). Happy to answer any questions about the game or the dev process!

      "title": "I've been treating my boyfriend like he's an OC",
      "content": "Since I got together with my boyfriend I've been treating him as if he were one of my OC's. For those of you who don't know, OC stands for 'original character'. It's kind of a catch-all term for the characters, personas, or fursonas people make up to use in stories, online roleplays, avatars, or an alter ego. Part of the culture of having an OC is drawing reference sheets of them showing their info like age, gender, likes, dislikes, etc and what they look like. And then using that to make TONS of art, fanfics, and memes. I cannot express how much energy and excitement I get from making drawings and little needle-felted plushies of him. I add a lot of fantasy elements to how I design him, with things like horns, wings, and cool accessories. And sometimes I'll make furry versions of him or in different video game art styles like Fallout or Overwatch. He loves that I make these things, but I ABSOLUTELY need to keep this stuff hidden from family members that come over and even some friends. To anyone who isn't familiar with fandom culture, it just looks like an unhealthy obsession. But to me, creating things is how I express joy. It just happens to look... really odd when I have fridge magnets, clay figures, and a wall of art dedicated to a fictionalized version of my boyfriend. I almost treat it the same way a fangirl does with an anime or a youtuber. Maybe it's a little extreme for most people, but I've noticed it makes our relationship really enjoyable. I guess I have more ways to show \"I love you\" besides saying it, buying gifts, or doing house chores. And I count myself lucky. Not every guy is okay with you one day coming up to him and showing off a doll that looks just like him. It's weird, but it makes our lives much more fun I think. submitted by /u/fangirl-throwaway to r/TrueOffMyChest [link] [comments]",

He has put me through so much that I’ve developed mental health issues and am undergoing psych evaluation. He knows this, and he keeps treating me horribly. Promising me everything I’ve ever wanted, saying the guilt eats him alive and he considered just leaving me alone but thinks it’s better to “make it up to me and give me the life I want”. But he’s not doing that, he’s still beating me for no reason, still stealing from me, still lying to me, still manipulating me, still doesn’t have a job, still doesn’t help around the house. I keep telling him it’s insanely cruel at this point. And he keeps going. There has to be something wrong in the empathy department with him. I was abused growing up by a mentally ill parent and they ended up getting the help they needed to stop. It doesn’t excuse what my parent did, and it doesn’t change it either, but at least they knew it was wrong and it had to stop. He doesn’t. He has no friends, no family that talks to him. I want to leave but I’m so mentally fragile atm and I have no friends or family near me. I know I’ll end up going back if I leave due to lack of support. I won’t be able to handle being alone in my current state. I want a soft life, surrounded by nature and animals with a man who loves and protects me and we can have a family.

I know a lot of developers just constantly update social media to grow their organic fan base. Some can do quite well going viral. I would say I had been doing a very bad job updating the development process on social media, partly because I have very low confidence on showing some of the work in progress, partly because most of our previous post did not have a lot of reponses. Now that the demo is out, I feel like the traffic is weak. I had been reaching out to content creators and media, but so far the coverage is very limited. Maybe it is just too niche? or the game is not special or good enough? =( Should I try to have some budget for marketing?

I have been agonizing about it. The rumination goes on and off in waves. I just do not see how one can make such a life changing irreversible decision without knowing how it will go. On the one hand, I would like to see my husband as a dad, I can picture an adult child visiting us with their partner when we are older, or having a young adult venture into their life. I can also picture going to museums and amusement parks with our kid, playing with them, building forts, reading books, making up stories etc. On the other hand, the irreversibility of the decision haunts me. What if I end up feeling trapped and hate my new life? What if our child is born with special needs? I do not think I could handle that. I know my limits. What if my body never bounces back? I am barely happy with my body as it is now, post partum changes could result in self-hatred and resentment. I would like to finish my studies this year, to find a new job, to advance my career, to expand my social circle. I want to spend time with my husband and not knowing how a child would affect our relationship is scary to me. I knew that if I were single, I would not even think about kids. I would not want them. My husband says it is a couple decision and it is natural that a single person would not want kids. I am not sure I agree. I suspected I had some health issues and had a blood test done. When I got the results and saw that they were good, except for some vitamin deficiencies, I felt disappointed. I was hoping that the result could show I am infertile or that something else is wrong with me and this would take this decision off my hands. I then thought maybe the way to go would be to just to stop protection and just leave it to chance. Just to throw the dice. I do realise this would mean a possibility of having a kid but thinking about this solution and releasing control also calmed me down a bit. If I were to get pregnant, we would have one and be done with it. But even one child is a commitment for life. I keep tormenting myself to the point when it is not healthy anymore. My husband says we do not have to have kids. He also says he is leaning towards Yes but with me, he wouldn't have a kid if he were single and he wouldn't go look for a new wife to have a kid with. I feel like at 35 I do not have much time left to decide but I just do not know what to do. submitted by /u/ObjectiveRate7144 to r/Marriage [link] [comments]",

Past 5 years were spent living off his savings. As of a year ago, my mother (Who had been stay-at-home) and I are having to cover the family's mortgage and debts. More minor, but my long term girlfriend of 5 years at the time broke it off a year ago. She didn't cheat on me, but was together with my only friend at the time not 2 weeks after we broke up. I had 12 aborted attempts last year. Mostly going for 2 am walks with the intent to throw myself off a bridge. I though it was getting better. I was admitted to the Psych ward last October, stayed for a week. Lied my way out, saying I didn't want to kill myself anymore. But I couldn't get the idea of how much my stay would cost out of my head. Lied to MYSELF, saying it was getting better. It was not. Have nothing to show for my week-long stay except a 5,000 dollar bill (after insurance) Better yet, just got fired from my job this morning. It takes all of me just to get out of bed in the morning, to open a can of soup. I haven't showered in weeks. Now I can't even look out for my mother and younger sister. Where do we go from here? I don't need real advice, I know what I have to do. To quote my favorite game, we just have to \"Keep on keeping on.\" I guess I just need to hear people say I should keep on , even if it's only strangers on the internet. submitted by /u/WaveBusy to r/SuicideWatch [link] [comments]",

I started the day at Rank 4,443 on IndieDB, and after a series of updates and community engagement, I woke up to find the game at Rank 50 out of 72,000+ games! Even more exciting: The demo just crossed the 1,000 units mark on Steam. Some stats that might be interesting for fellow devs: Median Playtime: 27 minutes (This was the most surprising part for me, people are actually sticking around!) Marketing Budget: $0. Just organic reach through Reddit and IndieDB updates. Engine: Unreal Engine 5 (High-fidelity visuals definitely helped with the initial \"hook\"). It’s a huge relief to see people connecting with the atmosphere I’ve been building alone in my room for months. I’d love to hear your thoughts on the visuals or any advice for the upcoming Steam Next Fest!

      "content": "Doing a re-watch now that it's on Netflix, and the dark tone of the last run of episodes is off-putting. I have really hated the Phillip Stroh storyline, especially the way Brenda lost her perspective in her obsession. Every time Curtis Armstrong appeared, I knew I would dread the rest of the episode. I honestly preferred the pyromaniac and his weird energy to Stroh's menace and elusiveness. One of the best parts of the show for me -- besides the unlikely chemistry of the team -- is how Brenda is so good at what she does. That is lost in these episodes as she is off her game (and not just because of her mother). Of course, the final episodes had lots of necessary darkness and change, with the leak reveal and Willie Rae dying (God, that killed me), but Stroh just felt like too much. I had to turn off the final episode last night 25 minutes in because it was making me too anxious -- and I know how it ends (mostly). submitted by /u/MollyDog2638 to r/majorcrimes [link] [comments]",

I’ve been seeking for a time to start a game dev project since I started my high school years, but it always gets interfered by something before I can actually progress. So, recently I finally got accepted into a university I wanted, and I figured that it could be the best time to start now as I need to learn comprog in engineering anyways. I started by learning C++ from those 5-6 hours tutorials and implemented it a little, nothing serious. Currently I’m watching a tutorial on SFML, but it seems the learning curve is pretty steep. Additionally, I’m working on an isometric 3D-ish project so I’m not even sure if SFML could do it. I feel like I’m learning it just for the sake of learning it right now. Should I switch to learn Unity/Godot/Unreal first before jumping into something like this?

I've manually registered the 'beats' (spawn time for each ~music note~ - which are the bullets here), and it works really well on windows. The issue is that when I export to HTML5 and run in on the browser, it is noticeably off-sync. So much that it seems the music is just background music and has no connection with the bullets themselves. Everything is coordinated through audio_player.get_playback_position(): the spawn of the bullets and their position on the screen, nothing is using delta time. I've looked around and haven't really found any answer to this Is this a known issue? Is something wrong with my approach? Is there any work around to sync the bullets with the music, like it happens on the Windows export? Also, if I add some offset time to make them match on my Firefox, the still don't match on Edge. Without the offset, the sounds I hear are significantly late compared to what get_playback_position() is registering submitted by /u/Sad-Local-6229 [link] [comments]",

I started the day at Rank 4,443 on IndieDB, and after a series of updates and community engagement, I woke up to find the game at Rank 18 out of 72,000+ games! Even more exciting: The demo just crossed the 1,000 units mark on Steam. Some stats that might be interesting for fellow devs: Median Playtime: 27 minutes (This was the most surprising part for me, people are actually sticking around!) Marketing Budget: $0. Just organic reach through Reddit and IndieDB updates. Engine: Unreal Engine 5 (High-fidelity visuals definitely helped with the initial \"hook\"). It’s a huge relief to see people connecting with the atmosphere I’ve been building alone in my room for months.

I'd love to see the game go in this direction rather than Yandev trying to take himself and the game too seriously with all the stupid lore and whatnot. Even then the more controversal original topics (such as characters being under 18) could have been kept if someone other than yandev could have implemented them in a way that was a bit more sensitive or clearly supposed to be parody.

No. Game is supposed to be fun, i would like to avoid wasting hours of my time doing something i dont like to continue doing the things i love. Having the choice to afk, and what i thought, having active plays gives more exp, would be the next step makes more sense of a direction for me. Because the EXP was good, but it can be great. What makes it broken was because of MTX bonus experience. No i dont want less exp, the state that it is in now is good. Just need to be more rewarding if i am doing active methods.

I started the day at Rank 4,443 on IndieDB, and after a series of updates and community engagement, I woke up to find the game at Rank 18 out of 72,000+ games! Even more exciting: The demo just crossed the 1,000 units mark on Steam. Some stats that might be interesting for fellow devs: Median Playtime: 27 minutes (This was the most surprising part for me, people are actually sticking around!) Marketing Budget: $0. Just organic reach through Reddit and IndieDB updates. Engine: Unreal Engine 5 (High-fidelity visuals definitely helped with the initial \"hook\"). It’s a huge relief to see people connecting with the atmosphere I’ve been building alone in my room for months.

      "content": "To be completely transparent, this post will likely promote my game but perhaps some of you will find some value or inspiration from it as well as I know this info is great for other devs. I posted a while back about the release of the Android version. As a heads up to how much the game has earned up until now (6 months in), It's life changing money for me, but in the videos I mention below I just talk about the first month in the hopes that maybe it can stir something in some of you to either continue developing your games/apps or maybe even start it as a hobby like I did. I released my hobby project Bricks Breaker RPG with no previous dev experience. It's been a life-changing and I never in a million years thought that a hobby could end up this way after such a short time. It took me 18 months to code the game and I managed to finally release it on Android and iOS a few months ago. It's now sat at 4.9 rating with 2000+ reviews across both platforms. So the players seem to be very happy with it. The Android release grossed $11,165.00 in the first month and iOS Grossed $2,765.00 I have a couple of videos that I can share with you if you ask that talk a little about the individual releases. The TLDR is that I didn't promote the game outside of Reddit really, I tried a few ads here and there but ultimately they were a waste of money. I wish there was a secret formula to success launches but I honestly think if the game/app is good enough, that's most of the hard work done.

      "content": "The monthly hard reset is excessive, compare it to every other game's ranked mode. The low player population makes it even worse, 1/3rd into the season and there isnt enough diamond players to fill one table. Its also just annoying to have to wade through the low ranks every month, if you dont have a ton of free time or if you take a break from the game then boom back in silver, have fun grinding back to the top; hope you have a ton of free time for just this game. The resets need to be longer or give a much lower hit to ranked points.

      "content": "Hello I've recently been working on implementing proxy chat in a game. I haven't done this before and don't fully understand the underlying systems so followed this tutorial which sets it up with the voip talker component. After a few tweaks everything seems to work fine apart from one thing. I have a level which, when loaded, loads other mini levels into it, in its level blueprint. For some reason doing this cuases the proxy chat to break for clients. the server can still hear the clients and themselves but the clients cant hear anyone. The mini levels are loaded in using the load level instance by object reference node. I have no idea why this is happening so wondering if anyone has come across this before. It seems to work fine if i remove loading the level instances. I'm wondering if theres a network thing here with a race conidition or if the load level instance node resets the voip talker for some reason but im just shooting in the dark. submitted by /u/Konoisseur [link] [comments]",

What if after getting unhooked of the killer tunnels you within 3 minutes and you haven’t done an inconspicuous action - while injured (self care and healed by another is ok) you get a percentage chance to get the endurance status effect. Like 65/75/85. I’d also like it if there were traps that can be armed/disarmed from both sides. Pro - you have a way to slow down killer/gens. Con - it cost time. If it affects the opposite time without them turning it off it gets worst. Would also be cool to find an item maybe in an intractable like pumpkins that can activate something like fog, grass, birds, totems Etc. make for more evasive maneuvers or killer perks. I’m not a game dev so idk but seems like the things they work on almost never improve the gameplay loop.

      "content": "Before you list all the examples in which a bug is a feature, hear me out. The title is intentionally provocative because it's a sentence that's often uttered as a joke. To give an example: Someone says something along the line of: \"In my game, there is a bug that makes enemies explode on death!\" And someone else says \"That's not a bug, that's a feature!\" Of course, the intention in that moment is likely understood. You might have created some kind of gameplay by accident, but it probably should be a feature. Right? That is completely fine and legitimate, actually. That's how Fortnite got Rocket Surfing after a Halloween update that made rockets just big enough to surf on after you shot them. After the update people demanded it stayed in as a feature and Epic Games obliged. It has even spawned an entire franchise of games (GTA) because the creators was making a different game but accidentally made police cars super aggressive so they always tried to run you over. That made them pivot and make the first GTA instead of what they were going to make. However, I have experienced the following happening as well, and that is the real issue I am tackling today: Someone leaving in a bug because it's fun gameplay. That needs to be avoided. Some of you reading this might be rolling your eyes, but you are not the intended audience then. People who are new to gamedev or are unaware should know; Unpredictability should be intentional, not a glitch or a bug. Because if you can't control it, then you can't design around it. So be mindful of that whenever you see a bug you want to be a feature. Actually do the work and understand the bug so you can deconstruct it and reconstruct it as a controllable element in your game.

My laptop keeps making this Brr sound and sometimes slightly freezing whatever it’s doing. For example if I’m playing Helldivers I will hear a brr and it will freeze for a frame or two. Nothing game destroying but enough to be annoying and noticeable. The games itself have begun to lose frames. Where I could comfortably have 60 frames in a large fight it may now drop to 20! The weird part is the sound will come from different areas. With no headset in it comes from the computer itself but if I plug the headset in that brr noise comes through the audio of the headset.

I know HDD isnt ideal for a back up storage but IDK if it'd be completly unusable or if Id be able to put some games on there? If not the two M.2 drives at 480gb and 480gb seems like by far the best option but maybe theres some reason using two M.2 drives is worse then one M.2 drive and one storage drive.

I'm trying to create a weird tileset here to recreate Bubble Bobble. Basically the idea is that the tile has one-way collision on all sides except the bottom, meaning the player can jump into the tile from below and walk out of it, but they can't walk or fall into it. I managed to make basic one-way platforms with this, but this task is proving difficult because I can't set the direction of each individual polygon; all of the polygons directions are down. I can of course rotate the node itself but that won't fix the problem since all of the collision polygons are still facing the same direction. Something is telling me I'm gonna have to find another solution to this problem but I honestly can't think of what it would be without getting really complicated. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated! submitted by /u/muscularmouse [link] [comments]",

I'm trying to create a weird tileset here to recreate Bubble Bobble. Basically the idea is that the tile has one-way collision on all sides except the bottom, meaning the player can jump into the tile from below and walk out of it, but they can't walk or fall into it. I managed to make basic one-way platforms with this, but this task is proving difficult because I can't set the direction of each individual polygon; all of the polygons directions are down. I can of course rotate the node itself but that won't fix the problem since all of the collision polygons are still facing the same direction. Something is telling me I'm gonna have to find another solution to this problem but I honestly can't think of what it would be without getting really complicated. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated! submitted by /u/muscularmouse to r/godot [link] [comments]",
