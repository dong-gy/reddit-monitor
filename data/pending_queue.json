I've noticed a spend a lot of time sitting idly trying to think of which classes should be in charge of what, and how they should all interact with eachother to get my game working how i'd like. Right now im attempting to code a kind of board game, so drawing pieces, placing pieces, how they move on the board and in your hand and all inbetween. It would probably be smart to plan out before i get too deep in the code, so i can avoid spaghetti and sitting idly. Maybe there's some kind of planning approaches for systems like these i dont know about.

      "content": "Btw I think most people know this but still let me put some information here for those who doesn't know about DLS and having CR7's siu celebration in-game. So since the old DLS versions (iirc) CR7's siu celebration was part of the game till DLS23 and almost every player would do that celebration that too very frequently but since the release of DLS23 they kind of nerfed or something and most times no players were doing the siu including CR7 too. But siu wasn't removed entirely tho. Because I myself saw my players or Bot players or Opponent's players doing siu but VERY VERY rarely in DLS23, 24 and 25. And it continued like that as for the time being and even now. I think siu was never removed but Devs intentionally or unintentionally nerfed the celebration to very odd so we don't get to see it more often. But those who've played the 20, 21, 22 versions know that players used to literally spam the celebration back then after scoring and that was so frequent. One other thing is that I noticed sometimes players doing the siu celebration after winning career games final game be it the all star game or the final of global challenge cup or anything, in the end when all player and managers do the run off celebration and one player hits the siu. I noticed this in DLS25 too but haven't seen it in DLS26 as far as now. But it looks like siu is still in the game guys for the time being. submitted by /u/Cholic_Gerardo to r/DreamLeagueSoccer [link] [comments]",

You have developed the most pathetic excuse for a Star Wars game we’ve seen since BF2 at launch. It is unfathomable to me that you somehow destroyed your game so thoroughly that we are all losing conquest energy on battles that just… don’t… start. How in the world does that get past testing? Do you do any testing at all? At all??? I’m a few battles in and it’s already happened to me twice. Refunds. Now. But this keeps happening, your game just doesn’t work and you refund us over and over with a bunch of stuff. That’s cool and all, but why isn’t your game just working in the first place? Just pathetic, incompetent shit that would make a game design team in college scoff. Figure it the fuck out, your game must be so profitable because you’ve stopped testing and fired any devs worth a damn.

In strategy games, you spend half your life in menus, so I refused to let this just be a boring static spreadsheet. I spent the last week polishing the UX to make it feel as crisp and responsive as the combat itself. What’s under the hood: Seamless Drag & Drop: for unit placement. Smart Category Filters: to sort huge rosters instantly. Dynamic Layouts: Move and resize blocks to shape your formation exactly how you want. It’s been a challenge getting the \"game feel\" right in a UI, but I’m really happy with the flow. Let me know what you think! submitted by /u/Cifurr55 [link] [comments]",

Then, i didnt like the way of progressing the game, like, i dont want to get 700 amy hearts for me to advance to the next area, and if i did, i dont want to do that IN EVERY SINGLE WORLD BUT WITH A RESKIN.

      "content": "Hi guys - first project with Godot here and I'll keep it short. I am making a small Grand Strategy game and trying to add markers onto my map such I can have units / places visible. Here is the necessary context: Important Setup Visuals The crux of my issue is that I can't interact with my MapMarkers' MarkerCollisionShape , despite it being visible on the map. If I move the MapMarkers node outside of the SubViewport they become clickable, but in the wrong location. If I keep them in the SubViewport then they are in the perfect location but not clickable. Here is a demonstration of that: https://preview.redd.it/6k2ktzsodmeg1.png?width=812&format=png&auto=webp&s=5fcbf83461d0c010da18438ee9ce15a12cfbbfda It would be amazing to keep them within the SubViewport such that I don't have to recalculate the centroids for my all of my regions. My only understanding is that this is likely due to coordinates outside of the Subviewport being 3D while 2D inside - but I have fried my synapses trying to figure out a solution. Right now my player input is handled by the following script attached to the Player (Node3D): extends Node3D signal region_selected #Nodes var camera: Camera3D = $CameraSocket/Camera3D var camera_socket: Node3D = $CameraSocket func _ready() -> void: pass func _unhandled_input(event: InputEvent) -> void: if event is InputEventMouseButton and event.button_index == MOUSE_BUTTON_LEFT and event.pressed: shoot_ray() func shoot_ray(): var mouse_pos = get_viewport().get_mouse_position() print(mouse_pos) var ray_length = 2000 var from = camera.project_ray_origin(mouse_pos) var to = from + camera.project_ray_normal(mouse_pos) * ray_length var space = get_world_3d().direct_space_state var ray_query = PhysicsRayQueryParameters3D.new() ray_query.from = from ray_query.to = to var raycast_result = space.intersect_ray(ray_query) if !raycast_result.is_empty(): region_selected.emit(Vector2(raycast_result.position.x,raycast_result.position.z)) Thank you so much for anyone whose time is lent!

      "content": "Recently I have been having massive issues with sleep and my overall well-being. I can’t sleep for more than two hours at a time and I’ve been having vivid, awful dreams every single night. I wake up sweating and scared and exhausted. I’m always tired. Always. Falling asleep in class, in the car, during meals…it’s bad. This has caused me to move my “bedtime” from 11pm to now 9pm or earlier some days. I have band and other extracurriculars every day after school, some days I don’t get home until 9pm. Of course I also have to do homework when I get home and sometimes even practice my instrument more because I’m in so many different ensembles (roughly 7 different bands with different music). And of course there’s getting ready for bed, getting ready for the next day, and eating dinner. With all of this, I barely have time to do more than one thing of my choosing at home. I used to do so much, whether that be video games, sewing, working on crafts, making videos, playing with my dogs, and more But not with my schedule, I have to *choose* between relaxing or doing something I enjoy. I hate this. I want time to relax in bed, take a bath, play some games, but I also want to be able to know I have time and energy to do all my crafts and playing with my dogs and even just cleaning my room. Not only this, but I believe my new ADHD medication has made me start to feel extremely icky and useless when I’m not doing something. So not only do I hate not being able to do all this, but when I am relaxing and just lying in bed hanging out, my mind and chest are all icky and I feel so…stupid and useless. I just want the time and energy to hang out *and* do things I love. submitted by /u/Peanut_Femboi to r/Vent [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Alright here's a game, pick a random episode of Simpsons, then a random episode of Family Guy, then tell me how these two have anything in common besides featuring a lower middle class American household Homer is a stupid fat drunk who's sometimes an asshole Peter is an alcoholic manchild with very little intelligence, but he makes up for it by being genuine and unabashed at being himself- which of course a lot of the times is an destructive asshole who's a danger to him and everyone around him-- but the core part of Peter's character in the first 9 seasons is that his immaturity and impulsiveness is where all the conflict and humor comes from. Now tell me, how's that even remotely similar to Homer? It isn't All of this falls apart when looking at the rest of the families: Bart, Lisa, Marge, etc, none of these characters are like anybody from Family Guy And the funniest part is these shallow comparisons are usually where it ends, because once you compare pacing, tonal and writing styles of these two shows, they diverge even further. Family Guy is optimized for laughs per minute and edgy shock value-- in other words, the absurdity and randomness is the appeal. Simpsons is honestly a Proto-Adult Cartoon these days; it feels more like a sitcom that just happened to be animated rather than live action. And yes, Family Guy's Golden Age (Season 3 - Season 8) beats all of the Simpsons any day. There's a reason why South Park and Simpsons basically teamed up to try and defame Family Guy during its prime. They were simply jealous that Seth MacFarlane had found a new formula that worked and was \"low-brow\" compared to what came before. Not realizing that all animated sitcoms are low brow and not exactly peak comedy lmao submitted by /u/RedditSucksMyBallls to r/CharacterRant [link] [comments]",

I would like constructive criticism on my match and performance please. I have come back from a 5 year hiatus on the game. I used to be gold-plat on my old account for context. I am aware that Bronze players now are better than the Bronze players back then so I am not too ashamed of being in Bronze. I just want to climb out. Replay code: DC1TVF Battletag / in-game username: likejava Hero(es) played: Tracer/Phara Skill tier / rank: Bronze Map: Route 66 PC or console: PC Note: I had switched to Pharah mid match because my teammates had requested, I get off of tracer. They asked me to get off of her right as the first match ended. I switched to Pharah because 1) She is very familiar to play and 2) Their reaper, torb, and brig started to become annoying and 3) My teammates requested that I switch. While I know that torb counters Pharah, I decided that I could play around it. I have no idea why they switched to Mei after that. Note 2: After practicing and reading on this sub to try to become a better Tracer, I realized that my sensitivity was WAY too high (17) so I bumped it down to 6.5. I haven't gotten used to doing 180s at this sens so please bear with me. It's especially apparent when the Torb kills me in the tunnel. submitted by /u/NoTransportation8027 to r/OverwatchUniversity [link] [comments]",

It’s the mental mistakes that are costing us games. Missed layups, we practice layups at game speed constantly at practice. Turnovers, bad passing, high risk passes that lead to nothing. Fouling 80 feet away from the basket when the other team is in the bonus. Not knowing who they’re are guarding when playing man to man. I just feel defeated. We go over our plays, when they run it we get open looks. We talk about the importance of taking care of the ball, getting back in transition. Making our layups and not fouling. Just venting.

I'm not even opposed to the idea of message length limits, just tell people they've hit it so they can shorten their message instead of deleting the paragraph they just wrote. Also I know someone who graduated from reddit university is probably gonna miss the whole point in this rant and say something like \"just type your message in the notepad before sending it\" and you are missing the point. I shouldn't have to find a workaround to something that shouldn't even exist in this game. this is a text based game, THE CHAT IS THE ENTIRE POINT, how have i been playing this game for like 3 years now and they still haven't fixed a blatant issue in the primary feature of the game. could you imagine any other game having an issue this fundamental to their mechanics for so long? imagine if gta had a feature where if you tried shooting too much the gun despawned or something, how long do you think it would take them to fix that? a chat based game shouldn't have such a basic, easily fixable, issue with their chat system after this long. fix your game devs. wtf submitted by /u/Express-Tip-6337 to r/TownofSalemgame [link] [comments]",

      "content": "I know this will probably be ignored, but I’m posting it anyway. I downloaded Tor because I wanted to browse the internet anonymously. It’s clear that normal internet use isn’t private anymore, and even basic political searches can feel risky. Tor seemed like the safest option. What I found was illegal content almost immediately. There were links leading directly to websites hosting child sexual abuse material. This was not hidden or difficult to find. The links were openly shared. The volume of it was overwhelming. Images and videos of children were being distributed without any attempt to conceal it. I was disgusted and angry. I couldn’t just close the browser and move on. I started collecting links and usernames so I could report them to the CyberTipline. I organized URLs and pages to make the reports clearer. Every report required seeing more material. The amount of content involving children was disturbing. I am still a minor myself. That made seeing this harder to process. These were children being abused and exploited, and adults were actively trading the material. I’ve submitted many reports. I documented usernames, pages, and links. I also interacted with some of the people involved to confirm intent, then reported those interactions. Now I’m worried that my actions could put me at legal risk, even though my intent was to report and stop the activity. I want these sites and accounts taken down. I don’t want to ignore what I saw. At the same time, this has taken a mental toll. I feel stressed, angry, and constantly worried about whether I crossed a legal line. I don’t know where reporting ends and personal risk begins. I need direct advice and safety information. Has anyone done this before without facing legal trouble? Did reporting actually help? Should I stop before this causes more harm to me? I’m trying to do the right thing, but I don’t know what the safest option is anymore. submitted by /u/Sad_Raspberry_6759 to r/TOR [link] [comments]",

The Quest 3 is SO close to a level of graphical capability chat it can just barely handle some modern graphics features like real time shadows. I think that once standalone finally gets to a point where it doesn't suck to look at, devs will be more willing to put effort into games for it:) submitted by /u/GuyWithALizard to r/OculusQuest [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Will be living on cruises for most of the time in the future and I'm pondering about what to do with my gaming setup. I of course thought about getting a handheld PC for this but after digging, I'm currently of the opinion that using my flagship Android phone for Android games and emulation (including low-spec PC games) and getting a high-end laptop (e.g., latest Zephyrus) for demanding emulation and PC games is the wisest with its balance of providing the best experience for both on-the-go/on-the-bed and sitting in front of a desk while maximizing cost spent. I'm making this post to get the opinion of actual handheld users in hopes of reading things I haven't considered resulting in me either changing my mind for the better or solidifying my thoughts. Conditions/Situation 1) Non-portables such as your traditional PCs and living room consoles are out of the question 2) The flagship phone is already on hand (Xiaomi 14 with an SD8 Gen 3) 3) Will also have a PC/Android compatible controller I've considered the following too and here were my thoughts: 1) Steam Deck: too weak for some of the PC games I'm looking at, has a lot of overlap with what my phone is capable of running, I just get the advantage of having a separate gaming device which doesn't seem cost-effective 2) Xbox Ally X/Legion Go 2: more performance which will let me run demanding games better even while OTG, but is not as powerful as a gaming laptop for when I want an immersive, as little compromise as possible experience (also has a smaller screen) 3) Ayn Thor: really cool and tempting form factor with its dual screen, but I figured its largely a novelty as my phone's more powerful comparatively 4) Strix Halo Handheld (GPD Win 5): Now we're talking real power and should run any game I want with satisfactory framerate and settings, but still has a smaller screen 5) Strix Halo + Portable Monitor: Quite possibly the most compelling alternative for me as it solves my issue with the smaller screen, but unsure about the OTG experience particularly concerning battery life Input is very much appreciated.

They were compact, clear, minimalistic, never distracted me, and provided essential info, like kickable vs unkickable casts. Yes, they did lack a few important features - like debuffs on the mob or the ability to adjust the distance between the enemy model and the nameplate. But overall, they worked great and felt intuitive. The new nameplates, on the other hand, are nearly impossible to make look good. I can’t get the width right - they’re always too wide. They are too cluttered. No preset feels right - for example, only a handful of presets let me move the mob name above the nameplate, but those presets are oddly tied to “thin” nameplates or a thin cast bar, which makes no sense. Not being able to change the mob name text color to red unless I use preset that also makes bars thin is wild. Can't decouple mob name from mob health. List goes on. As a result, everything feels cluttered. The game is more cognitively demanding than ever, and I somehow miss more important information than ever before. And no, it's not a habit thing. TLDR: Please let us recreate visuals closer to how nameplates used to work. And yes - gradient colors looked far better than the flat, mobile-game-style visuals we have now. The current look makes the game feel cheap /shrug. PS: I’m not using/didn't use Plater or similar addons. I genuinely prefer the original design aesthetics of the default UI. submitted by /u/ngrubo to r/wow [link] [comments]",

It feels like we're all just gambling on luck rather than following a proven system. I'm starting to believe that marketing is the true \"final boss\" of game dev. Do you agree?

I noticed the 'Burning Rewards' system where the reward amounts slightly decrease every 3 days. ​I'm currently at Board 17 and progressing a bit slowly because I’m also completing 'watch an ad' tasks in Idle Bank Tycoon at the same time. ​My questions are: ​Is it worth pushing for these rewards despite the 'burning' mechanism? How much do they usually drop in the long run? ​Does it make sense to spend some money (in-game purchases) to speed up the process and reach higher boards (like Board 100 or 125)? ​For those who completed this offer, at what point did you find it getting too difficult to continue without spending? ​I've attached screenshots of my current reward table.

Unlike regular triggers, an NPC trigger moves together with the NPC. - Taught NPCs to use navmesh-based pathfinding. - Improved the shadow system. In the video: - One NPC constantly follows the player (script). - Another NPC patrols along a route defined by coordinates (script). - At the end of the video, I add a trigger and a script that turns off one of the light sources when the player enters the area.

      "content": "I dont mean to rant but the overall performance feels like its fell off a cliff ever since septimont and now the 3.0 update. I’m running the game on a rx 9060 xt, 32 gigs of ram and a Ryzen 7 5700x. I tried turning on FSR but even though the frames were higher the game felt even more stuttery and laggy than it does without it on. I feel like this game is very cpu heavy and isn’t utilising the gpu as much as its supposed to, hope the devs find a way to optimise the new regions going forward. Does anyone else with similar specs have the same issue? submitted by /u/WoodpeckerMean272 to r/WutheringWaves [link] [comments]",

      "content": "One thing that’s always bothered me about this game is ultimate weapons and their abilities. They should reflect their namesake and the devs need to go crazy with them just like they did with the Thunder Cage. For example: Secret Garden: After so many weapon hits to enemies are entangled with vines stopping enemy movement 25% chance to spread to other enemies on kill. This has diminishing returns. (This weapon does very little damage so it should provide some sort of utility and it would keep its bonuses to Tech/Dimension skills) Divine Punishment : Activates bombardment after so many weapon hits. When allies are within range of bombardment Divine Forgiveness is activated and it heals them for 25% of max HP/Shields .(I would remove this ability from Greg’s Reverse Fate and find a new ability for it) Hammer and Anvil needs to be changed to a Hammer and Sheild : Melee hits from Hammer buff Anvil increases DEF by 20%. When Anvil takes damage buffs Hammer increases melee damage by 20%. When Hammer and Anvil are both at max, activates End Game : Hammer and Sheild can be thrown for five seconds kills extend End Game’s duration up to ten seconds. submitted by /u/shadow-side2022 to r/TheFirstDescendant [link] [comments]",

      "content": "I am working on a card roguelite, with gameplay heavily inspired by a traditional card game from my country. Sort of like what Balatro did with poker, but with a regional game instead. I am aware this will probably make the game sell a bit better in my country, but do you guys think it will make it sell *worse* in the rest of the world, if i do get to that stage? Of course I would make tutorials and stuff, but this traditional game has pretty complex rules that aren't entirely intuitive. If people have to learn a sub-game to be able to play the game itself, will that pull them away from it?

      "content": "I’ve been following a lot of upcoming memecoin projects lately, and Whally Coin ($WHALLY) is one that genuinely stands out as it gets closer to launch. At its core, Whally Coin leans fully into what makes memecoins work: a strong, recognizable whale-themed identity, clear branding, and a heavy focus on building community before the token even goes live. Instead of rushing a launch and figuring things out later, the project is setting everything up properly in advance. One of the more interesting parts is that Whally Coin isn’t just stopping at being a memecoin . According to their official info, they also have a game launching soon , which adds another layer of engagement beyond just holding a token. That kind of utility fits really well with meme culture — something fun, interactive, and community-driven rather than overcomplicated promises. The team has also been clear that the contract address (CA) will be shared first in their TG , which helps keep things organized and avoids confusion or fake links when launch happens. If you’ve been around crypto long enough, you know how important that is during early moments. What I like most is how cohesive everything feels already: the branding, the messaging, and the direction. It doesn’t feel like a rushed cash grab — it feels like a project that actually understands meme culture and how communities form around it. With launch coming very soon , a growing TG, and a game on the way, this looks like one of those projects people will wish they followed earlier.

      "content": "Lenin Street Geek Shop was born from memories of the 2000s: neighborhood kiosks, pirated discs, weird merch, conversations with shopkeepers, and the feeling that adult life starts too early. We wanted to make a game not only about running a shop, but also about growing up, making choices, and the people around you. You play as Kirill, a teenager who drops out of school and works in a small shop to help his mother fulfill her dream. You can develop the store, decide what kind of place it will become, meet customers, make friends, get into conflicts, take questionable compromises, or try to stay honest. It’s important to us that every action carries emotions and consequences. We’re inspired by everyday life and the atmosphere of the time: an old computer with mini-games, a street where something is always happening, conversations “about nothing” and “about everything at once.” If you’d like to help make the game better, sign up for the playtest on Steam. We’re planning a release in 2026. We’d also like to give away several Steam keys to the best commenters on this post. https://store.steampowered.com/app/3225880/Lenin_Street_Geek_Shop/ submitted by /u/SlightlyAttached [link] [comments]",

      "content": "I remember staring at the PS5 shelves, wondering if the Pro was really worth the extra cash. Here’s the thing: if you don’t currently have a 4K TV or aren’t chasing ultra-high refresh rates, the Pro’s benefits are minimal. Most games that offer Pro enhancements make you choose between higher frame rates or better visuals anyway, so the “best of both worlds” pitch doesn’t really land. For someone playing single-player story-driven games like Horizon, Spider-Man 2, or Elden Ring, the base PS5 handles them beautifully. Adding a disc drive can actually save you money in the long run by letting you buy cheaper physical copies or secondhand games. The Pro only really shines if you plan to invest in a 4K 120hz setup in the future or want that extra storage, since it comes with a bigger internal drive. From my experience, focusing on offline play lets you ignore the Pro’s minor advantages and just enjoy the games as intended. You still get all the major features and stunning visuals on the base model, and if you ever upgrade your monitor or TV, you can consider the Pro down the line. For anyone in the same boat, are you going for the Slim and saving the difference, or planning to future-proof with the Pro? submitted by /u/edward_dd to r/PlayStation_X [link] [comments]",

      "content": "'The drinking and eating disorders of people may be just as much a compulsion as sexual orientation. And people may be drawn or even compelled beyond their personal control toward alcoholism, drug use or obesity by natural inheritance as well as emotional trauma and addiction. No one would dare say that these individuals or members of society cannot change these unfruitful and sometimes even destructive behavior or damaging practices. No one would think it is okay to buy alcohol for or encourage an alcoholic to drink. The changing of compulsive behavior often requires a more in depth approach to the problem or practice than many are willing to make. Many of the conditions labelled as problematic are really only symptoms of deeper issues. Treating the symptom seldom helps in overcoming the problem. In fact such treatment may merely mask the real problem behind more symptoms and/or side effects. Ideas that become accepted in the mind as unchangeable facts can become immune to reason, being rooted deeper in the mind of men than they are willing to go. To even question those ideas is often perceived as a personal attack and source of anger and fear. If someone can be groomed to accept an idea or a pattern of behavior, that behavior is not the product of birth but of external influence that may have infected the individual. You cannot rightfully address the mentally accepted behavior without addressing the mental influence of the grooming and the presence of the vulnerability that allowed the grooming to become effective. It may also be true that strongly conservative religious views that lead an individual to seek to change themselves in their sexual orientation are often motivating and even driving the process through a form of ideological grooming. Their own religious beliefs may be a product of preprogrammed religious practices and rituals that resulted in their own Mass Formation of Psychosis.' preparingyou.com/wiki/Homosexuality #AbolishHumanArchism #RepentWithUs #ChristianAnarchy https://preview.redd.it/27677jsy4leg1.jpg?width=7700&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ae7e57f4ae41e731057b1208b015c03f4845c009 submitted by /u/AbolishHumanArchism to u/AbolishHumanArchism [link] [comments]",

The real problem is the prices and the ways to find them, in fact, they cost a lot together and this would make it difficult to have all the brawlers maxed out in the game. I have 4 solutions: add more ways to find them for free, decide which resources we want to use at 2000, put a change of coins and energy points so it would solve all the problems of those accounts that have too many energy points and lastly put a shop just for resources, in exchange for seasonal cups, where we can spend them either for mega boxes or for resources submitted by /u/CraftRough6320 to r/Brawlstars [link] [comments]",

Hopefully it can be useful to others experimenting with narrative-driven systems.

      "content": "Our game, Letter Lost, is coming out later this year, and we decided to make a shift on our capsule art. We loved so much about our old art, but found that at conventions, it gave people the wrong impression. People would see our banners and immediately assume our game was a point and click mystery rather than a dystopic work sim set in a 3D environment. I do think we lose a sense of the narrative focus of the game with our new capsule, but capture the vibes of the gameplay in a more tangible way. Would love to hear what you think when you see each capsule, and if one draws you in more! submitted by /u/joojabean [link] [comments]",

This quest for Shiny Pets has seen me through a new and better job, my son turning 2 and 3, my daughter turning 1 and 2, a root canal, week long trips to Vegas and Alaska, my dog’s surgery on his eye, my grandmother succumbing to dementia, me winning $500 on a scratch off, my weight-loss journey losing over 30lbs so far, getting a shoutout from the devs, all of life’s ups and downs. Throughout everything I’ve been through, this was something that kept me constant. Kept me going even during the hard times and giving me something to look forward to everyday. Having something to do and interact with such an amazing community has been a blessing. I truly enjoyed every single time someone would comment and let me know how much they enjoyed a Shiny Pet, had ideas, questioned how Shiny Pets would work, wondered about future Shiny Pets. This started as just a funny little project but as the days climbed it became something I truly enjoyed doing. I am lucky to be part of such an amazing community, and make a name for myself as “The Shiny Pets” guy. I also want to thank Arkuni for even indulging me and adding the Shiny Pets intro animation. It really means a lot to me that I inspired something in a game that means so much to me. Even though I may not be posting everyday anymore, I’ll still be here in the subreddit. Upvoting all Sloth wins, upvoting all big PP hedgehog builds, being helpful and answering any questions for new people, theorycrafting new and crazy builds. Thank you all.

It started as a weekend experiment to make something bright, relaxing, and satisfying, and somehow turned into a full-on passion project. Our goal was to capture that feeling of “just one more move” in a colorful, logic-based puzzle world. We’ve been building different visual themes — Underwater, Neon, Egypt, Halloween, and more — to keep it fresh while you clear the board. We just launched our “Coming Soon” page on Steam, and we’d love to know what you think of how it’s shaping up so far — visuals, tone, or anything that stands out (good or bad!).

When I found out about this I switched the gameplay to suit vertical gameplay. After talking to some friends, some prefered the horizontal over vertical, but most like the vertical style. I'm not planning on switching it back, but it got me thinking what other kinds of modifications have people made to their game to suit their player base? submitted by /u/Used-Stress-6941 [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Portals are in a good few games now, however I don't think any of them are as complex as Ultrakill. The obvious portal game that comes to mind is Portal. You are basically only bringing stationary objects through portals, the most complex being Turrets. However, Turrets don't have any pathfinding, and don't even look up. They just send hitscan fire through portals. I've seen people mention other games that have \"portal mechanics\" when in reality the portals are just PNGs that teleport you to another PNG. Not seamless like the portals seen in Portal and Fraud. The closest game that is somewhat similar to the mechanics seen in Fraud is Splitgate. It has both seamless portals and combat mechanics. However, Splitgate is PvP, meaning there are no NPCs that need to pathfind through portals. I'm making this post because I don't actually know a lot about Splitgate, or any other games that might include portals (except Portal). There might already be a game that combines portals and PvE. If not, then we have a reason why Fraud is taking so long. The game devs are trying make something that has never been made before.

The game will have a vast number of enemies, each with their own threat styles. There will be several distinct classes with their own decks, and a large number of artifacts, items, cards, and other cool things to find. Check it out on Steam if you're a fan of deckbuilders, and I know this genre is overly consumed in the market but it's my passion to craft a great deckbuilder (hopefully). submitted by /u/megaglope [link] [comments]",

I was over 300m away and across a river, in Yukon. Had a couple of smaller Grizzlies between me and this beauty. Had to scare the bears away, without scaring the herd of Caribou. Managed that, walked to where the bears were, then crouched to about 120m from the herd. Just as was going to go prone, the GAME moved the 💎 Bou (actually moved him 3 times. No he didn’t move on his own, the game just moved him). I was pissed I was gonna have try another day, but saw he was still there, just behind some other Bou. I crawled to about 40m when a 3rd Bou moved in front of the 💎. I side-crawled to get him in sight, while not spooking 3 MORE Bou just to the left of me. Finally got enough of an area of his chest to make the shot. I wish I would have thought to take a pic of how tight the shot actually was, but was so intent on what I was doing, I didn’t think of it.

It was called... QUIZZES. The game was a quiz mixed with YTPBR, with random characters, eurodance and trance music with the famous \"This is Sparta\" remix. And besides national rock, also Mamonas, Charlie Brown Jr., and hardcore punk from some Brazilian demo tape in 90s. And also, when you complete every 10 or 15 questions, a very well-animated cutscene appears, like 1st cutscene: Katy Kat from Parappa the Rapper, trying to invade an apartment while Concerto No. 2 in G Minor, RV 315 Summer: III. The game suddenly cuts to random characters in a bar announcing that Penny from WarioWare had been taken to the hospital after a shootout in Diamond City. However... while some scenes are completely 2D, moving in a 3D style like bitmaps in DOOM and poorly done, it looked low-budget and the rest well-animated, the game has many cutscenes dubbed in Brazilian Portuguese. They are funny, even the sixth cutscene is awesome. It showed the Syrian guy playing Casio Arabic keyboard with his feet and nose in the bar, and sadly, in the fifth cutscene, Katy Kat dies next to Lammy. The game takes 5 hours to complete and has many long cutscenes (ever cutscene is 10 minutes) that could make a movie. It's like a toy/game for Master System and Mega Drive, Pense Bem from Tectoy.

Currently, my capsule art is just a 3D render of the in-game cockpit. I chose this route as I wanted to focus on the \"Simulation / Diegetic UI\" aspect that defines the genre. Here is my data (~24 hours since page launch) Wishlists: ~ 50 (With any wishlists from family / friends / associates subtracted.) CTR (Coming Soon List): 21.43% (Although very small sample size) Page Conversion Rate: ~19% ( page visits divided by wishlist count ) The Question: I have heard (from this sub and others) that for the steam capsule art I really should hire a professional illustrator. However, considering my target audience is simulation fans, who often prefer fidelity/tech over stylized art, I'm wondering if sticking with the 3D render might be better. Does this current art look \"professional enough\" for the genre?

The MtgWiki for the plane even describes the plane as \" Escherian reality - or physics-bending effects - and kaleidoscopic geometric features.\" Seems very Reality fracture-y to me. I remember Gavin or Mark Rosewater talking years ago about how they were fascinated with the plane when it first appeared on a Plane chase card. The MtgWiki also mentions that Xerex won the player vote for plane featured on a Battle card during MOM that they most wanted to see recieve an actual set. That was in 2023... it takes ≈ 2 years to design a Magic set... what am I missing? I know there was a post about how Reality Fracture includes an innovation that was difficult to implement, but I also remember Gavin or Mark Rosewater mentioning that all cards featuring Xerex are symmetrical by design or something (I honestly don't remember exactly, I'll try to find the video or article source). And just look at the art we do have for Xerex. Xerex Strobe-Knight seems pretty Reality Fracture-y to me. Am I missing something, or is this an open and shut case?

      "content": "My bf of 4 years and I have been living together for 3.5 years and I am growing resentment for his lifestyle. I am currently in college and working full time, and he is on disability for (fetal alcohol syndrome) borderline personality disorder, and major depressive disorder. He is also receiving a 250k inheritance in a few months so he will have that to live off of. For the first 2 years of our relationship I was unemployed and living off of welfare and was really trying to find myself and get out of my depression. I felt extremely lost. I've luckily found a passion and I'm pursuing it in school and finally found a full time job and a part time job a year ago. Back when I was unemployed, I didn't mind his lifestyle because I could also play video games and relax all day. I deeply connected with him emotionally from the start, we have so much in common except for our ambition. Now that I've been working on myself a lot for the last year I've started becoming worried for our future. I imagined I'd feel this way and I wish I would have left early on before becoming way too attached. We want to have kids in the future, he's amazing at communication and he drives me whenever I need a ride to work/school. He just plays video games, day and night, from the moment he wakes up until he sleeps. He will literally wake up at 8pm and play until I leave for work at 7:30am usually. We do spend 30 minutes or 3 hours together everyday watching a show or something but then it's back to games But we are so happy living together and the intimacy is always perfect. We also have 2 cats and a whole future life imagined. I've communicated that I would really love to see him try to become more productive at least a little bit with time management, so I can feel secure with his reliability for the future, and he replies with \"well as long as im driving you and spending time with you it doesnt matter when I sleep or what I do when you're sleeping or at work\" I've expressed that it would be more attractive to me if I knew he was doing something to help him grow at least in little ways while I'm not around, to not have his whole life revolve around me and video games. This is just something we constantly fight about lately, because he sees it as an attack but I am just expressing that I am happy now, but worried that out mindsets and lifestyles will make us grow apart. I can't imagine leaving him it literally makes me want to throw up but at the same time I am so scared to be a mother who does everything herself while her man is napping cause he gamed all night. How the hell do I make a decision when he truly feels like the love of my life, but he clearly is so comfortable with how he lives I don't think he'll put that effort for me. And pf course it's even worse because he deals with bpd, fasd, and major depressive disorder. He has no family and not many friends so I feel even worse thinking about leaving him submitted by /u/ThrowRAfxntasi to r/relationshipproblems [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Just picked up the Caspia Wool Cardigan with Embellishment from Timeless London and honestly… it’s a showstopper. It’s crafted from a finely knitted, stretchy black fabric blend with wool, so it feels soft, warm, and comfortable without being heavy. What really makes it special are the subtle rhinestones and sequins scattered across the cardigan. They catch the light beautifully and add just the right amount of sparkle without feeling over the top. I love how versatile it is. You can throw it over jeans and a tee for an elevated everyday look, or layer it with a dress for evenings when you want something cozy but still polished. It’s one of those pieces that feels timeless but still has personality. If you’re into statement knitwear that’s elegant, wearable, and a little bit glam, this one’s definitely worth checking out. submitted by /u/PangolinAdept2433 to u/PangolinAdept2433 [link] [comments]",

I had installed directX9 and VC++ somewhere in the mix and now I'm having trouble getting a vanilla installation to work. I have deleted my instance in M02 as well. I ran the pre-shipped VC++ installer, and installed VC++ 2008 after deleting it entirely. In event viewer, I can see that the game crashed with the exception code \"0xc0000005\", which is a memory-related crash, indicating the computer is trying to access invalid memory. So I think this is some kind of weird memory cache issue, although I don't have any technical knowledge as to how these internal processes work, or what to flush. I think there must be something it's trying to access that it can't, and I have no idea why. I believe it would be something being loaded into the memory at runtime, then deleted, and attempted to be accessed? Any ideas on what could be causing this? I also noticed that when I try to launch through admin that it doesn't launch at all, unsure if this is normal behavior (because I have no way to test that), and the same code appears in event viewer. submitted by /u/FBIagent67098 to r/falloutnewvegas [link] [comments]",

Probably a very niche thing but I looked at discords documentation and found nothing to suggest how this exactly works so would be interesting to hear if someone knows how this works and how it can be set up. https://i.imgur.com/7lMlE4l.jpeg - screenshow of how the activity is shown on discord. submitted by /u/TheGingerHarris [link] [comments]",

Ever since OFA Deku dropped, it’s been a repeat of one broken character after another. From infinite melee loops with Deku, wide area nuking with Young AFO, repeated stuns with Iron Might, unkillabe destruction with Tech Shiggy, and one shotting with Lady Nagant, we finally have someone who doesn’t have an obnoxious gimmick that defines them. I know it’s only the start of the season, but I’m already in love with Tokoyami. He feels good to use and the payoff of “trying” in this meta of powerful characters is more rewarding than you think it is. There are moments when he’s strong, and moments where he’s weak, a near perfect balance.

And with small, but constant steps, they would see improvements and finally feel hope that everything is doable. It will hurt sometimes sure, but it's doable.

Any hints? Is there an alternative AO implementation out there? Am I making an artistic mistake? Note that in the image above, I have applied a height-based darkening gradient to the cliff face (it gets darker towards the bottom), which is not part of the SSAO.

I realized it didn’t work and then found out you can’t delete your psn without contacting PlayStation to get them to do it. Why? This is dumb and now I’m stuck with a psn account. I would just trade codes with like an Xbox or steam code but I’m not doing that because I’m gonna get scammed. I had the happen when I traded a Xbox nightreign beta code for a ps5 one but the one I got didn’t work so I’m assuming they scammed me. I didn’t really matter that much though since I was picked in a comment section that was giving out a code and that worked. I don’t have a ps5, I have an Xbox but it’s an Xbox one so I could play nightreign on it so I gave both ps5 ones to my friend to let them play instead.

Around a month ago though, I started getting random severe frame drops (sometimes single-digit FPS for a few seconds), especially when launching the game after a break. Recently switched to DX12, and so far the game feels noticeably smoother and more stable. The heavy drops seem reduced (not completely gone yet, but definitely better). My specs: • Intel i5 11th Gen CPU • NVIDIA RTX 2050 Laptop GPU (4 GB VRAM) • 16 GB RAM Did the devs change or optimize anything in DX12 recently, or is this just a coincidence / system-specific behavior?

I've been developing a pixel art game on a 640x360 resolution that I can later scale to 720p, 1080p, etc. However, I've been reading about the freedom that gives to have a native 1080p game with scaled assets, giving the possibility of sub-pixel movement, easier UI design, etc. I'm not trying to emulate a particular gaming period so that's no really important to me. Are the biggest cons of moving to a native 1080p that I'll have to be disciplined with my asset scalings so the art doesn't look inconsistent? What else should one take into account?

      "content": "Hey everyone, I’m having a weird issue with my Razer Kraken Kitty BT Chroma RGB Wireless (Bluetooth) headset and I’m hoping someone here might have run into the same thing. I got the headset last year and it worked perfectly until around December 2025 . For context: I use the headset for audio, but I use a separate external microphone for voice input. The problem: When I play Valorant and select Razer Kraken Kitty BT as my output device , the game audio sounds super muffled and low quality — basically like trash. But if I select my microphone as the output device , the game audio suddenly sounds perfect in my headphones… The problem is: when I do that, I can’t hear voice chat at all. What’s weird: • The headset works perfectly on Discord • Music & videos sound totally normal • No issues outside of Valorant • The problem seems to be only with Valorant’s audio + voice chat combo What I’ve tried: • Switching output/input devices in Valorant • Restarting the game • Reconnecting the headset • Making sure Windows default devices are correct • Drivers • Tried Razer support, but never got an answer... Still no luck. Has anyone had this happen with Bluetooth headsets in Valorant? Is this a Valorant + Bluetooth + voice chat issue? Any fixes or workarounds would be appreciated 🙏 submitted by /u/Sea_cake_ to r/ValorantTechSupport [link] [comments]",

This latest run led me to making a fatal mistake which was underestimating just how close I was to a bear and I zigged towards him instead zagging away from him on the lonely island at coastal highway. (note I was almost full hp prior to attack) It was really dumb of me since visibility was high I could've went the other way. I also got a literal tonne of rabbits on my run and encountered my first timberwolf pack. (they scratched me a bit but I managed to light a fire and healed up quite a bit) For day 32 I died this run ended much stupider which was walking around with a rabbit in my pack then walking directly into a wolf. It seems for whatever reason whenever I start getting comfortable in the game I start getting complacent and need to mind myself of this. Personal Achievement: I managed to walk through the cave connecting Pleasant Valley and Coastal Highway without using a single light source and got through the cave in almost complete darkness. Only took me 3 tries in under an hour! Biggest Challenge: I have the worst luck with matches, on runs I either wind up finding 50 of them or zero of them.

      "content": "So I am hunting the lakes at Parque Fernando. This means I am having to make some pretty long shots. For class 3 animals, I am using the Quist Reaper 7.62x39 with Polymer tips, because it gives the best down range ballistics. I have the Zeroing Perk so I can zero my scope at 328 yards, and I can make heart shots at that range pretty consistently with this weapon. I have practiced quite a bit with this weapon over at the Hirschdorf Rifle Range at 350, 400, 450, and 500 yards, so I know where it is hitting at those ranges as well and can make pretty accurate shots at the range. However, when in actually hunting, I cannot hit anything beyond 340 yards. I have shot at dozens of animals at around 350 yards, and the bullet seems to hit a wall before reaching them. I mean, I can't even wound them in the toe at that range. The bullet just will not go past 340 yards. At 335 years I can drill them through the heart, but five yards further, I can't even hit the whole animal anywhere. Now, If switch to the 308, I can drop them all the way out to 450 yards with no problem, so I know I can hit at those ranges. It is just with the Quist Repear that I am seeing this issue. I am just wondering if this is a known glitch in the game, or if I should write a report to the devs about it submitted by /u/Jungleexplorer to r/theHunter [link] [comments]",

      "content": "I’m currently working on a 2D video game doing frame-by-frame animation. I previously worked on another project like this as well, but in both cases I was the only animator, so I haven’t really had anyone to confirm whether this is a “common” practice. I work with animations at 60 fps, but I don’t use constant fixed values like 10 fps for all animations. Instead, I created timing tables so the programmer can implement them exactly as I planned. The key point is that I assign different frame durations to the sprites, not arbitrarily, but because I can clearly see and feel the difference in motion. However, when researching online whether this is a common practice, I couldn’t really find much information beyond discussions about animating at 60 vs 30 fps. submitted by /u/_onlydrop [link] [comments]",

      "content": "This is something that I'm always thinking about in the back of my mind, so I wanted to put some feelers out and see if I could get some feedback/experience from others in this subreddit. For context, I'm in my late 30's and only have a GED. I did some community college on/off, but my work/learning ethic back then was terrible, so after 6 years of part-time, barely committing to college I just sorta gave up. However, this is not a pity post and I've been extremely fortunate in my work life. I have past experience (5 years) at a FAANG company, 5 years in a senior role at a STaaS company, and I'm currently a Cloud Engineer at an edge compute services company. The reason why I wanted to ask this is because during my time at FAANG, to promote higher than an L6 required a degree - no exceptions. Many people could make a lifelong career out of L6 and below very easily, but there was always that ceiling that I would never be able to break through. I've thought about places like WGU and their CS degree, but it's a lot of time/money/effort to commit and I really want to ensure I'll be able to make use of it. So, people of IT - What has your career path been like with/without a college degree? Has anyone actually started their career without out, go for one, then find a difference in their careers? submitted by /u/Karmuhhhh to r/ITCareerQuestions [link] [comments]",

One of them was releasing the game into early access on the wrong date. ⭐ Tip 1: Don't release the game near or during a Steam festival. It reduces your visibility to zero. Of course, if you're lucky, there are games that have been successful despite these festivals. But there's no need to take that risk . Since our indie game is ClusterCluck multiplayer, keeping the price close to normal was a mistake. ⭐Tip 2: If this is your first indie game, keep the price as low as possible and build your player base first. ⭐⭐⭐BONUS - We chose the full release date one month before the next festival so you can participate (it has to be released one month in advance from a festival), and after the one-month Steam visibility boost you receive, you get another boost with the festival! submitted by /u/GlintzGames [link] [comments]",

Like: X% Aggressiveness and X% Military will lead to Monstrousness increase. Now. I don't know if the Devs are thinking about that, nor do I know what would be better going forward.

I’ve spent a long time in the cos community and have contributed a lot to it, but cos is becoming such a horribly neglected game that it’s getting ridiculous and I want no part in it. I sold my whole inventory and gave away some stuff, only keeping a dblr morth slot and the spec in case I come back, but I don’t think I will, unless the devs get it together. The past couple days I’ve been getting rid of my inventory, I got a good look at the trade realm, and not a single rev was less than 3k. Everything else was extremely overpriced, I had to pay nearly 25k to get a ghart because I’d accidentally put mine up on a stall for 11k, not realizing I had a slot to sell. I just think 25k for a ghart is a bit much. Not only is the cos economy completely wrecked, but the devs are extremely lazy, adding creatures with repeating features every week instead of tending to actual problems. The least this community needs right now is more creatures. This game has a lot of potential, and I’m very upset to be leaving this game, as it was my favorite game for a long time.

      "content": "Hi all, I noticed that the BESTA frame for TVs (the 70-inch wide, 15-inch tall version) states a max load of 66 pounds. The matching top panel (oak veneer) states a max load of 110 pounds. The combined weight of my media equipment (TV, speakers, gaming) is about 90 pounds, which exceeds the BESTA frame by a lot. I would like to use the TV frame with legs on the floor, add the top panel, and place the media equipment on top. But I'm confused how the top panel can hold more weight than the frame below it. I'm worried that the frame will collapse, even with the top panel installed. Does anyone know if this would work? Or is there another IKEA hack I can use to make sure that this design can hold at least 90 pounds? Or is the whole thing limited to 66 pounds because that is what the frame is designed to hold?

At the same time, I only discovered graphics and game development about a year ago, and I have major impostor syndrome as my coding skills aren't the strongest. An example of a topic I found interesting was Acerola's video on ASCII art: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gg40RWiaHRY I think it would be fun to do something similar, and I like the math aspect of it, but I can't figure out how it would contribute to research, or if it would even matter to an employer.

It's a pixel art game about social anxiety and most of the screens depict chat conversations and similar stuff. And yeah, I'm having a really hard time with the sound effects, the game already looks a bit light hearted because of the pixel art and the colors, which it's kind of softened by the theme and it ends up fitting well, but any kind of sound effect I try pushes the vibe to just silly and a bit ridiculous. And I've been at it for a while now. I know in the end it's not that deep because it's a very small project, but it's one of the first ones I make and it hits some personal spots so I don't want to get stuck here and end up shelving it, especially because the rest is all finished already. So yeah my question is, how weird for a very small game to have no audio whatsoever? Would you be weirded out if nothing played when you turned on the volume?

After months of solo development, the playable demo of Late Lines FM is now officially live on Steam! 🎙️😱 This demo is about 20-25 minutes long and offers a glimpse into the atmosphere I’ve been building. Please keep in mind that the full game will feature a much deeper story, more complex mechanics, and various puzzles that aren't in the demo yet. As a solo developer, I’m still working hard on bug fixes and optimization . You might encounter some rough edges, and I truly appreciate your patience. I would love to hear your honest feedback—positive or negative— please leave a review on Steam if you have a moment! It helps me tremendously in improving the final game. Also, if you run into any specific bugs, feel free to reach out to me directly on Discord. You can play the demo here: Store Page Late Lines FM Discord Server: Discord If you enjoy the atmosphere, adding the game to your wishlist would be a huge help.

Because of the nausea, NOTHING sounds appetizing to me. If I try and eat rice crackers to fill my stomach, I find myself randomly getting sick mid chew. I just threw up at work yesterday after a wave of nausea hit me after some apple sauce. By mid day, I am STARVING. Like my body is shutting down starving. I force myself to eat something that I can chew without wanting to gag, and find that I still feel starving!!! Last night, I went and got pasta for dinner. I only was able to eat a small amount before I felt extremely full, however I still felt HUNGRY. Basically, nothing sounds good, and when I do eat, I don't feel satisfied. It's driving me a little crazy, as I work 8:30-6:30 pm right now and have an hour commute both ways to work. It's really making me feel miserable. I have anti-acids when I need and morning sickness gummies with ginger and b6 (I also take vitamin D and B every night with my fish oil, prenatal, and iron supplement) but nothing seems to help. I've been underweight my entire life, so I'm a small gal. But I can't bear to lose weight right now when I should be eating at least a full days calories...but I just can't.

So if you have similar problem try disable all you other controller devices in device manager or unplug them because game seems to have problem when you have few simultaneously.

      "content": "Hi everyone, The moment is finally here! After months of solo development, the playable demo of Late Lines FM is now officially live on Steam! 🎙️😱 This demo is about 20-25 minutes long and offers a glimpse into the atmosphere I’ve been building. Please keep in mind that the full game will feature a much deeper story, more complex mechanics, and various puzzles that aren't in the demo yet. As a solo developer, I’m still working hard on bug fixes and optimization . You might encounter some rough edges, and I truly appreciate your patience. I would love to hear your honest feedback—positive or negative— please leave a review on Steam if you have a moment! It helps me tremendously in improving the final game. Also, if you run into any specific bugs, feel free to reach out to me directly on Discord. You can play the demo here: Store Page Late Lines FM Discord Server: Discord If you enjoy the atmosphere, adding the game to your wishlist would be a huge help. Thank you for your support! 😊 submitted by /u/AlarmedPumpkin8446 [link] [comments]",

I found that the best way to make my hand drawn sprites look the best is by drawing a small one (goblin) at 256x256 down scaling it to 128x128 in gimp and then importing it to Godot where I zoom out with the camera to make it smaller on the screen. This was after 4 hours of research and testing stuff out. Then for an ogre I would make it at 512x512 and put it down to 256x256. Is this the best practice for getting art into my game, then making it small but still keep it look not pixelated and blurry. I first tried just making the sprites 20x20 but that made it super ugly. I am using a 1280x720 res. Any other tips on import settings/project settings are appreciated! submitted by /u/preppypenguingames [link] [comments]",

Great at listening to what we wanted. One thing I still noticed hasn’t changed is the upgrade price. At level one hundred it would cost me 100 thousand gold to upgrade from a purple to pink. I’m already picking up pink and can craft it. It’s not like I’m crafting something I can’t. It makes it such a useless mechanic and it is in theory a great add on. Especially with the fact you get plenty of crafting material without having to farm on the slightest. I remember when the upgrade mechanic first dropped to go from brown to gold for something in the upper end of leveling, around 300, was like 15 million gold. These prices don’t equate to what you are receiving. I know nothing is going to be changed, but I have never used the upgrade deal and never will. Still a great game.

Problem is that adding Nav Obstacles to towers and placing them doesn't seem to work. I've done a little research and it seems that Nav Obstacles don't work with tilemap layers. Is there anyway I could do this without having to add a navigation region to each path? Each path is made for one map so I'd rather not have to do anything that requires me to draw a path and then draw a navigation region afterwards... but tbh I'm clueless as to what else to do :/ Of course my enemies use NavigationAgent, I'm new to Godot so I'm not sure what the norm for pathfinding really is, I assume it's good XD submitted by /u/Physical_Metal6063 [link] [comments]",

I've played some single player games, but I completely lost interest in gaming recently, as new games feel more like movies with too long cutscenes and not actually experiencing the story through gameplay, and thus games feel dull to me. I've bought kindle 3 months ago, and feel like, I've used kindle more purposefully than desktop PC I've build year ago. I don't want to watch 10 mins cutscenes to have any idea what's happening in game , I could just watch Netflix. Does anyone relate ? I have this rtx3060 on 1080p (144hz) monitor, which I understand, people say is low (budget) end (intel i5-12400F , H610M-K D4, 32gb ram). Which I feel like GPU won't be used much because there's no new games that interest me at all. I always thought it would be great, but I just open chrome. In fact I could reinstall to chromeOS Flex, and I wouldn't feel the difference. I just notice it now (bc I never had PC to my ownership 😂). I feel like smartphone and laptop already killed desktop long time ago. Desktop is just a for gamers or work professionals.

      "content": "I've always thought about this, a goal that ties the game with 2 minutes left feels way more important than scoring the 6th goal in a blowout. But they count exactly the same in the stats. While on parental leave I started to vibe code this small site which weights points based on game situation. Everything was done during naptime, no kids were harmed :) https://clutchpuck.com Tying goals and go-ahead goals count more. Garbage time goals count less. Empty netters are basically worth little. Shorthanded goals get a bump etc. Adrian Kempe, Kevin Fiala and Tyler Bertuzzi rise the most on the standings. Biggest \"garbage time\" players are Glaude Giroux, Quinn Hughes, John Carlson. Cole Caufield rises +20 positions (from 29th to 9th). Curious if anyone else has thought about this or has further ideas on how the weights should work? You can also adjust the weights yourself if those seem too low or high. Clicking the player name will open up further information. https://preview.redd.it/3rsk1szwjzeg1.png?width=2590&format=png&auto=webp&s=871cba4dadf7e23080606bd79f4476864390cebf submitted by /u/valstu to r/hockey [link] [comments]",

      "content": "In the Fall of 2015, a buddy and I started taking our lunch break at his nearby apartment and developing a board game. It involved Reserving Champions and Promoting them into a Lineup to fight each other. Inspired from Pokemon TCG and Dominion, we called it BattleBox. After learning a lot about game design and balancing, eventually we took new jobs and moved on from Battlebox but about 1 year ago, I decided to bring it back to life. Now, 10 years later, on March 9th 2026, BattleBox will launch as Luxuriant for both MacOS and Windows on Steam. Link for those interested: https://store.steampowered.com/app/3887370/Luxuriant/ Would love wishlist if this is your style of game. submitted by /u/CStaplesLewis [link] [comments]",

      "content": "so a long time ago on Roblox there was a game I played called warrior cats: Forest territory. to me this was like my comfort game or somthing I would get on and play with a bunch of random people who actually wanted to talk to me and hear my thoughts and ideas during that time not a lot of people I knew in real life wanted to talk to me much so forest territory I guess was a place where I could go to escape reality. but the dev stated that they were working on a new game and that in this new game the models would be way better and there would be animations too. So originally I was really excited about this i thought they were going to make this new game way advanced than Forest territory was and I was correct in that assumption when they released the game in early access they would eventually permanently shut down Forest territory and I was really sad about it but I ended up begging my parents for Robux so I could buy early access to the new game but eventually it released for free to everyone and it attracted more people because of the really good animations and models and I was also excited about this too more people would mean more ideas and people to roleplay with but it just was never the same as forest territory was now when I join this game nobody really does warrior cat roleplays anymore and before i could talk to people about the books almost everyone knew of them and had atleast read some of them but in this new game a lot of people don’t really. read the books. no one really talks to me there anymore either and I can’t really find anymore former forest territory players. that game was where i could go and talk about my love of warrior cats with other fans who loved and cared for both the books and the game it was where I would go when I was crying my eyes out and talking about warrior cats and roleplaying would make me feel better. This new game tho its just not really like that I used to play it a lot but eventually I just kinda stopped playing it because well it just didn’t do for me what forest territory did. To me forest territory wasn't just a Roblox game it was a whole community that taught me things when I was new and stuck by my side for as long as the game was open and now it’s gone if any former forest territory players see this it was an amazing experience while it lasted and I’m glad to have been apart of it. submitted by /u/Sorry-Warning1142 to r/WarriorCats [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Recently, as I'm sure 99% of you are aware, we received confirmation that LuaGuy has taken over the majority of ownership of Outcome Memories. While I personally don't know much about him, it seems that things, especially within the community, are beginning to look less bleak. I for one, am excited and hopeful, thanks to the non-stop encouragement and engagement Romeo has been giving our community. I think I speak for everyone when I say this, we are eternally grateful for the loyal members of the development team, be it Community Managers, coders, moderators, or what have you. We will continue to support this amazing project as long as you guys are committed to doing what you love. If anyone from the dev team or mod team is reading this, we're proud of you. We love and appreciate you. And you deserve this break. With all the recent drama, things seemed to be truly over. Chaos and doubt began to build within the community, but through Romeo, PR, and others, we were able to hold onto hope. As for now, as a whole, I think we the community need to take a step back from the devs and give them room to breathe, spread hope to those around us, and most importantly, continue showing the devs our support through posts akin to this, and playing the game. While I am sad that the game is on hiatus, and that the server is closed, it's time we come together in this moment to enjoy what we've already been given. Despite the jank and balancing and bugs, we still love this game, because we know what it can become. This is an ambitious project, and I believe in every single one of the developers, and all of us to show them that we want them to do their best, to flourish, and keep going, whenever they are ready. Thank you for reading. HOPE & PROSPER! submitted by /u/a_sweet_token to r/OutcomeMemories [link] [comments]",

I've got a moderately sized farm going, and I've been racking up essence of life over time by planting purely turnips as they're one of the best plants I can grow right now given the tier of my farmer's workbench. I was planning on then breaking down all those hundreds of turnips I've built up over the last few days into even more essence of life, so I could make some eternal seeds for other plants. I built up a bit over 2,200 EoL and it took a while, considering the length of one in-game day. I wanted to primarily grow wheat, and I didn't have enough wheat to make the amount of eternal seeds needed, so I decided to make some standard wheat seed bags to grow more. Issue is, I must've \"fat moused\" (if that's a term) and accidentally hit ALL, rather than making them in smaller, appropriate amounts. So, just like that, I lost every damn bit of my EoL that I built up, and I have a bunch of useless seed bags that I don't need. Is there a command I could use to give myself back 2,200 EoL or am I just kind of screwed here? I tried looking it up first but the command I'm seeing online isn't working for whatever reason.
