Watch algorithms like BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, and A* run step-by-step Compare different algorithms side-by-side See how they explore, backtrack, and make decisions in real time Built especially for learners who struggle to “see” what’s happening under the hood Fun fact: this project was a Swift Student Challenge 2025 winning submission. I’d really love for you to try it out and share your honest feedback. Reviews, suggestions, and even criticism are more than welcome - it genuinely helps improve the app 🙏 Download link: https://apps.apple.com/in/app/algomaze/id6753229909 Thanks for checking it out, and happy coding! submitted by /u/HustyFoxx007 to r/Review [link] [comments]",

Instead, as a and b get closer to being opposites, the returned angle is closer to 0. The more a and b point towards the same direction, the closer the returned angle is to π. Why exactly is that?

They pointed out: The game most likely stores which feather you've shot/\"taken\" down, regardless of how they respawn, and this game memory most likely reset once you've hit all of them. It then checks if you did it in the correct order, if not, no trigger. And this is precisely what I was wondering for the longest time. Shouldn't such game logic be relatively easy to find in the code? Why did none of the crazy Reddit RDR2 detectives find anything similar yet? Even before that, can we somehow infer from the code whether the spider webs or the feathers are triggers that change the game state in any way? submitted by /u/alasthennars to r/reddeadmysteries [link] [comments]",
