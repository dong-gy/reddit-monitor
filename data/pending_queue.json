Some of you even turned into actual friends that I’m so happy to have met. This has been one of the coolest parts of working on this game so far. The support has been amazing, and the best way I can give back is by putting all my effort into making the game better every day. If you haven’t played BIRB already, this is a great time to do so! The game just received a big update, adding tutorials and making everything more clear for someone new starting :) Birb is a multiplayer game that you can play solo too, meet new people, create custom rooms for your friends to play in, and most importantly: completely FREE!

In many occasions I literally forget I have an UI view open because it's not distracting to me. I've added a few screenshots showing different interactions in action. Curious how this feels to you. Is it intuitive or distracting? How does it compare to classic pop-up menus? All of these work perfectly well with directional controller inputs btw.

For Lelouch to win, he must figure out that Johan Liebert is the killer, find evidence to convict him, and have him arrested. Otherwise if Johan gets away with it or kills Lelouch, it's game over. For this rundown, Lelouch won't be allowed any help from the black knights, use any tech from his own world, or use his geass as he must solely rely on his skills and intelligence. It's also worth noting that Monster takes place in the 1990s so its technology is more primitive compared to Code Geass, making it harder for Lelouch to capture him. One advantage Lelouch would have is that he's already used to working in the shadows as Zero so he wouldn't reveal himself to the public while Johan wouldn't know much of Lelouch's background to successfully manipulate him. What makes Johan different however is that unlike Lelouch's enemies, Johan doesn't have pride or desire power. Instead, Johan tricks others into believing he doesn't exist. He's also known to change his methods and motives at the drop of a hat which is why he's so hard to capture. Johan once tricked a man into committing suicide and an entire townsfolk into killing each other, and he made all these unsolvable murders without even needing any special powers. Lelouch would be assuming a similar role to Detective Lunge, and Lunge only suspected Dr. Tenma of being the killer and didn't think Johan was real because Johan was that good at manipulating people. Lelouch would suspect Tenma at first, but after a few days of investigating him, he'd conclude that Tenma's innocent since Lelouch is already used to dealing with manipulators and would unlikely fall for Johan's tricks. The biggest difference between the 2 is that Johan is a serial killer while Lelouch is a war strategist. Lelouch defeated Mao, who can read minds, and prerecorded his conversation with Schneizel, meaning he was able to predict not only his responses but also his timing. Lelouch even disarmed a bomb that was far more complicated than anything Johan set up. And even though Lelouch won't be allowed to use his geass, he's already experienced supernatural elements which completely throw any logic out the window, so whatever tricks Johan would throw at him would be nothing compared to what he's already been through. Based on all these feats, I personally think that for Lelouch, it'd be difficult but not impossible for him to capture Johan.

But in Trine 5, many puzzles boiled down to trial-and-error plank placement, which felt more like brute-force than clever design. Here’s what I’m curious about: How does Trine 5’s puzzle complexity compare to earlier entries? Are there standout levels that break the ‘plank spam’ trend? What mechanics from Trine 2/3/4 should have carried over to avoid this issue? As a newcomer to the series, where should I start to experience its peak creativity? I’d love to hear from veterans—what moments in the series made you say ‘That’s a Trine moment!’? submitted by /u/Suyio12 [link] [comments]",

The player controller script is also given below. Note that this is not the final script from the video as the final script behaves more or less as intended as far as I can tell. But there is a point in the video at about 9:30 where he does an attack and then it hangs on the last frame of the attack because the upper and lower are not synced at all, hence the content of the _ready function in the code block. But when I copy his code and the animation setup exactly (at least as far as I can tell), I get the looping behavior that I talked about earlier.

      "content": "Hi everyone I am having strange std::find_if behavior with my C++ program. It is going to be hard to describe without pictures. So basically I am making a card game and I have sorted this array of cards called my_FU_sorted (size 3). Now every card has a rank and a suit and if a card is considered to be out of play, I give it a rank of 13. Now I run this code: int first_playable_index = std::find_if(my_FU_sorted.begin(), my_FU_sorted.end(), (const Card& c) {return c.playable(p);}) - my_FU_sorted.begin(). p stands for the pile of cards and its basically saying \"In this sorted hand of cards my_FU_sorted, give me the first index where that card is playable\". I have made cards with rank == 13 unplayable. Ok. Thats the first part. Now when I run the program the first time, my_FU_sorted is made of 3 cards and is {Card1(rank =13), Card2(rank == 5), Card3(rank == 8)} yet somehow it returns first_playable_index as 0. But then on the second run my_FU_sorted is now {Card1(rank =13), Card2(rank ==5), Card3(rank==8)} yet somehow some miracle first_playable_index is now 1, rather than 0 the first time. I am really at a loss for words. It makes no sense. Especially when I run in GDB my_FU_sorted[0].playable(p) for both times, and they both say false, so it should've not been possible for first_playable_index to be 0 the first time. submitted by /u/johnnyb2001 to r/cpp_questions [link] [comments]",

      "content": "To the people that throw temper tantrums in this game: If someone’s emote spamming on your body or saying thanks, just play along. You beat them next round/fight? Then you emote spam them. That’s classic For Honor. There’s no need to freak out and attempt to throw the match or rage quit. It’s not personal, ever. These people don’t know you, and you don’t know them. So just play the “toxicity game” and laugh at it. It’s hilarious seeing a hero spazz out after they’ve beaten you, and feels great to do the same back to them. If you take it personally, you’re no longer having a good time. You’re angrily mashing your keyboard/controller trying to prove something to someone you’ll never know. The toxicity is normal, but not having a good time on a game you play every day isn’t. TAKE A BREAK, and then come back to the game with a mindset of wanting to have a good time. As weird as it sounds, toxicity in For Honor is not the same as toxicity in other games. It’s woven into the game itself, and for most people, it’s all in good fun. Not everyone that spams has a “fragile ego” or is a bad person. They’re laughing at it, win or lose. You, though, are gritting your teeth and raging. Which just makes it even more funny for them. When you actually get mad, all you’re doing is choosing to not have fun in a VIDEO GAME. So see it as it is, a game, and have fun. That’s all, best wishes to everyone submitted by /u/FeachEE to r/ForHonorRants [link] [comments]",

      "content": "I want to preface this by saying I love YGO. Have since I was young. I’m not a competitive player by any means but I always really enjoyed the back and forths in the anime and dueling friends when I was younger. When Master Duel came out I was thrilled that there was an official sim for the game and got back into it after years. Few years in now and I’ve noticed a pattern. More often than not, people are running decks that love to go first and sets up a board that has multiple negates or floodgates, etc. I’m not mad they exist, they’re part of the game. But why, in the name of the Pharaoh, are they SO DAMN POPULAR. I understand that there are people who are so obsessed with winning that they want to play floodgates and negate boards, but what is so fun about these decks that EVERYONE seems to play them? What is fun about NOT LETTING THE OPPOSING PLAYER PLAY THE GAME? It feels like the equivalent of playing chess as white, making your opening move, and then flipping the board and declaring victory before your opponent can make a single move. Why is this play style SO common? It feels like EVERY. SINGLE. DUEL. It’s to the point where genuinely if I go second and I don’t have any hand traps or a hand with 5 starters it feels like I should be scooping to not waste my time. Even in casual, it’s the exact same. Especially because MD for whatever reason is allergic to best of 3 format so you can’t even adjust to play around a lockdown. I know the play style exists and I know people who just want to win will use it but when did that become seemingly the ENTIRE player base? It’s mad frustrating that I just want to play the game but I rarely ever can because I get hit with every floodgate or negate possible before I even have a chance to play a card. What happened? Genuinely baffling as I don’t see how it’s fun for anyone, especially given that a lot of these decks play the exact same combo every time to get the lockdown. No variety, no change, same combo to prevent your opponent from playing. The same community who hated Mystic Mine with a fiery passion for stopping gameplay seems to be doing everything in their power to replicate it. submitted by /u/Professional-Gas1682 to r/masterduel [link] [comments]",

      "content": "We’re running into a pretty common problem right now. During development everything feels manageable because we know the mechanics inside out. But once the demo went live, reality hit. Average playtime is short and a lot of feedback says players can’t even get past the first level. How do you usually deal with this when it happens? Do you lean toward adding difficulty options, or do you try to fix it by tuning the core gameplay instead? At what point do you stop trusting your own instincts and start fully trusting player feedback? Curious how other indie teams handle this without overcorrecting and making the game too easy. submitted by /u/Ok_Might5360 [link] [comments]",

      "content": "I'm new to learning Godot, and also learning about the benefits of Data Oriented Design. I couldn´t find much discussion regarding GDScript on this subject, so I did a few benchmarks of my own and I thought I'd share the results here. I did three tests, each comprising of 100000 particles affected by gravity How I would normally write the code as OOP, do everything in the class As an Array of Structures (AoS). Which is similar to 1 except the class is now just the data, the logic is in the manager As a Structure of Arrays (SoA). Which in this case is parallel arrays which have synchronised indexes. The code for the tests is here I ran the tests, one after another, 4 times each. I let each script settle in for a little bit, then at a random time took a snapshot of the times in ms per frame for running _physics_process. I'm not a scientist but I thought the results were telling enough. Run 1 Run 2 Run 3 Run 4 Average OOP 505 527 467 451 487.5 AOS 409 369 402 410 397.5 SOA 282 250 249 284 266.25 I'm interested in your thoughts, in improvements I could make without totally ruining readability (I'm not doing interleaved arrays, I just can't), or what I did wrong Specs: Godot 4.5.1 Stable, Linux Mint 22.2, AMD Ryzen 5 5600X, GeForce RTX 3070 submitted by /u/CountNovelty [link] [comments]",

      "content": "For reference: I use blackshark funcooler 4 pro and redmagic VC 6 pro cooler I also tried 2354x1080 and 2772x1272 and the fps issue still presist, only battery was better after lowering it I went pro in a game called Bloodstrike, not that many of you will know but it's a supported 165hz 165fps game by the OnePlus 15, I ended up buying the Chinese 16GB+1TB version that's flashed with oxygenos16 because I make content too, when I first loaded into the game after downloading it the game ran 165fps stable in highest graphics, then the next day it started dropping to 144(138-147) and then sometimes going to 165 and mostly goes 144, I didn't find any fix, I put graphics lowest, highest, and the result is the same fps, I changed every game assistent setting to pro, balanced etc, changed everything to performance, same fps drop to 144(note that it only drops to 144 when I'm playing and when I die, spectate or idle then it goes back to stable 165) I came to a conclusion that either highest or lowest graphics settings don't matter anymore and it's either a game or phone issue, then a few days later I tried to remove Bloodstrike from game assistent, and somehow it fixed itself and went to stable 165fps, but not too happy because it suddenly the next day started being unstable 165fps AF, and it didn't matter either way highest or lowest graphics, also my 3 friends with redmagic astra have stable 165fps on highest settings in the game and the OnePlus 15 is supposed to be stronger(specs wise) and cooler(inside and external cooler that I use) also when I either stream or record the fps drops aswell. I'm unsure if it's fixed in 501 or not as I'm still in 401 oxygenos16, I'm also unsure if it's an issue with Chinese device being flashed with oxygenos, but I'm pretty sure that the device is too overkill to actually have that low fps drops to even 90 when it wants. submitted by /u/FyBornEX to r/TheOnePlus15 [link] [comments]",

Things started off great where he basically revolved around me when possible while being able to live our lives. When I got kicked out at 18 I had to move in with his family for a year until my mom could afford an apartment for me and her. Living with him wasn't enjoyable sometimes, he'd ignore me for his games, be rude, and didn't exactly respect my space in our room, I kept my stuff in a corner and he kept throwing his stuff over and in my walkspace. He even would leave me alone without anything to do for hours on end as I cried because he wanted to hang out with his friends who didn't want me included, especially one friend who hated me(I had fucked up and hurt him in the past but we worked through it). I had gone to a mental hospital after maybe 2 months as I just couldn't handle how life was going. I'd pay his bills and help support him through schooling so he could get a good paying job he enjoyed. Now I'm living with my mom and he stays with us, I work minimum wage and make more than my mom, we struggle to pay rent. Whenever I try to ask my fiance for help he seems to act like its such an issue to help pay for a place he basically lives at, he showers the longest, eats the most, does his laundry, etc etc. Now he has even started to basically refuse to pick me up from work because he would rather play MTG at card shops than get me. I feel unimportant, I feel like shit, and I don't feel like he cares. What do I even do? What happens if I just move to Texas from the PNW? What can I do? I'm just lost and need help Tldr: my fiance would rather prioritize friends and mtg over me and I don't know what to do submitted by /u/Uniquegrlygamer to r/relationships [link] [comments]",

How can I get Nexus Mods / Vortex to install and run on Linux? (Since using Wine didn't work). Is there a working method to use BepInEx for modding on Linux that doesn't break the Steam launch?

As for me, I'm a 24 years old man from France that love to learn languages, maybe a little too much because I tend to take too much load at once on that subject but I love it. If you care about my others hobbies, I love Formula 1 with all my heart. I love doing sports, which include mostly running, badminton, tennis, hiking and climbing, staying healthy in general is a subject I like. I used to read a lot of fantasy, although way less nowadays. I like coding and making new engineering projects in general as it's the field i'm currently studying in. I also play a lot of chess and some videos games. I think that's most of what I do but I'm open to talk about anything because it's precisely what I like, to talk about something, a country or whatever I don't know well ! As for you just be truly willing to learn. I usually have free time during weekends but during weekdays it's harder for me to be active. I don't require a lot of activity but the only thing I'm asking is for you to be willing to find subjects to talk on. Because usually on here I try to give subjects to talk about but I'm meet with a dry \"yes/no\" response which isn't ideal for practice. Otherwise I'm open to anyone ! Have a nice day !

The best \"movie adaptation\" anyone could do should be a 2 hour cinematic for a game. No need to \"reimagine\" with a \"director's vision\". This bad habit of Hollywood is more about ego pleasing of the makers of the movie, than actually selling a franchise to newcomers. They did a great job with Arcane. Arcane is a 6 hour game cinematic. No need to \"adapt\" anything. Game cinematics are already a movie. Just make the game cinematic long enough. After seeing the great work in Mechwarrior 5 Clans cinematics, and how cool the story is, and its look and feel, that is exactly the look and feel that a Battletech movie needs. Just make a 2 hour game cinematic telling a story, made by the same people who made the game cinematics, and voila, you have the best Battletech movie possible.

And then upload \"I REMADE MY 24 HOURS HORROR GAME BUT BETTER\" over and over. Is there a reason behind this? Are they lazy? Is it all just an elaborate view farm fueled by fiverr? Are there good examples out there that shipped games? Share your thoughts, Cheers!

It would also be a great way to farm money too because i believe that dungeons should give a lot of money depending on the difficulty, for example give 20k money, meduim40k, hard 60k and nightmare 80k money i think it would make grinding for money much more easier, they could also add new boss drops within these dungeons that would have good passive when it comes to forging because i'm kinda getting bored with mine this, then get this pickaxe and mine this it would make progressing seem much more fun and what do you guys think about this idea and feel free to leave your opinions about this. submitted by /u/Ok-Perception-4275 to r/TheForgeRoblox [link] [comments]",

The reviews on Steam are all rave, but a lot them describe what I think are features of the free patch - trade deals, company rework etc. As far as I can tell, the DLC just adds prestige goods and charters for companies (monopoly etc.). Is there much more, any narrative flavour etc not mentioned in the dev diaries? I appreciate that the free patch with the trade rework was very well received, so wonder if some of the love for that gets mistakenly attributed to the DLC by those who bought it on release. So my question is, do people think the DLC content from CoC significantly contributes to the game, enough to justify ~£17/$20 price tag? submitted by /u/Aggressive-Area-213 to r/victoria3 [link] [comments]",

TBH, I wish there were even more tourists, and they congregated mostly in the museum and shops like in New Leaf. submitted by /u/FixPrestigious5426 to r/AnimalCrossingNewHor [link] [comments]",

      "content": "Hey all, relatively new player here, completely hooked on the game and lore so far, but I’m clearly missing something. Question: What’s the overall strategy to have the strongest empire while keeping a very small empire (as in: minimal number of star systems under my direct control)? Context / what keeps happening to me: I’ve been playing “grab as much territory as possible” because it feels like the only way I can scale my economy enough to build fleets. I’ll expand hard and stretch myself thin across 100 stars just to hit ~100k fleet power…and then I’ll check my neighbor who only has like 12–20 systems and they’re sitting at 590k fleet power. That gap feels insane. So: - How do you actually play “tall” in Stellaris and still be #1 militarily? - What are the key pillars (planet specialization, tech rush, megastructures, vassals/federations, etc.)? - What should my early/mid/late priorities look like if I’m trying to stay small but punch way above my weight? - Any specific builds/starts/civics that make this click for a newer player? Thanks — I’m hooked on this game and want to learn the “small footprint, huge power” way to play. **HUMANITY FIRST** submitted by /u/-novac- to r/Stellaris [link] [comments]",

My character was an experienced redguard bounty hunter. Wanted to leave hammerfell for something new to spend the rest of his life. Planned on retiring. But got arrested and lost everything. He had to start from scratch. Instead of answering the Dragonborn call, he chose to be selfish. He did every bounty he could, killed dozens of bandits, all to purchase a property near the corrupt town of Falkreath. I finished building the manor, I looked out the alchemy tower, and that was it. I did what made sense for the character I created. I may go back to him later but as of now he’s done. I’m not done with Skyrim, but this was one playthrough out of many. Posting this for someone who was in a similar boat to me. You don’t have to even touch any real quest, you could play it as a sandbox, an adventure game, a completionist game, or like me.

I was thinking of having a character be autonomously guided down by his jetpack after having his life support hookups detect a potential cardiac incident, after he's in the hospital for evaluation of what caused the issue, he gets a bit on the nutty side with his comments to lighten up the mood. The issue here is how, so for instance, if he jokingly quotes portions of \"Achy Breaky Heart\" in the dialogue, the concern becomes one of implied melodies for anyone who is familiar with the song and catches the reference (assuming that voice acting is not used for the project), and if that implied melody could inadvertently trigger the song's licensing matters (and for obvious reasons). Can anyone advise? submitted by /u/Dedderous [link] [comments]",

Yet they stated that they're disabling this feature? Stitching the two sides back together like in the picture would allow a proper naval front to develop with a midline of island hexes from Godcrofts to Stema Landing and the eventual target of landing on and overrunning the enemy's large island. A big gripe that I'm hearing from naval clans about this announcement is that they're forced to choose between the lane that can invade the enemy's large island or the lane that can only defend their own faction's large island. It just feels like a huge missed opportunity turning what could be a dynamic ocean lane into two linear ones. submitted by /u/Cakey642 to r/foxholegame [link] [comments]",

We'd like to open up the Kitchen and large Living Room so they feel more connected when spending time in those areas. If we used the current combined area marked \"Kitchen, Living Room\" as our primary living space, it wouldn't be large enough to host gatherings, and then we're kind of wasting the large \"Living Room\" space on the left. Our idea is to basically remove the walls on either side of the Dining Room. It will also require moving the oven from the Dining Room wall along the back wall, and then perhaps enlarging the island. I think we'd then plan to keep a dining table where it is, there just wouldn't be wall boundaries on either side. Does this make sense? It still seems like we're not optimizing the space since now we also have the smaller \"Living Room\" area that isn't really used, but maybe this is the best we can do without major renovations like relocating the entire kitchen. I'd also really love to fit an office somewhere, but it's not necessary. Thanks! submitted by /u/dmeixner to r/floorplan [link] [comments]",

Our goal is to build this game with people who love otome games as much as we do, not just quietly behind closed doors. If you have questions, thoughts, or just want to say hi, we’d love to chat in the comments.

This is possible because as you explore you can take map tiles off the table that no Helldivers are on (or if they are on they die) to make room to add others. This mechanic also allows for... Endless Exploring/Infinite Play Space (timestamp 13:58): Since the battlefield isn't limited to a set number or specific tiles you can potentially keep exploring down an endless corridor of map tiles if you wanted to! This is a unique mechanic that I think can make for some interesting situations. And since map tiles are shuffled and recycled it really will randomize the events/POIs/etc you find if you choose to go this route. submitted by /u/MelArlo to r/TableTopHelldivers [link] [comments]",

      "content": "I hate her voice, I hate the way she talks, I hate her insufferable personality, I hate how she acts like she’s better than everyone. I hate her forced wittiness. I hate her voice lines (I shudder at “I’m obviously the most precious”) I hate every time she speaks in the spawn room. I hate how Blizzard always gives her a skin. I hate the obvious favoritism one of the devs has for her with a literal tattoo of her. I hate that she makes no sense in the canon, shoehorned in as a childhood friend of the Shimadas even tho they’re pushing 40 and she’s supposedly in her early 20’s. I hate how she feels like someone’s OC. I hate how they made her kind of likable in her cinematic then made her annoying as shit in-game. The only thing I like about this chud is that she’s fun to play and she’s good in-game. But it also pisses me of that she’s one of the best, if not THE best support, because that means I have to be subjected to her annoying ass even more, and I HATE THAT I ENJOY PLAYING HER. submitted by /u/dessnee to r/hatethissmug [link] [comments]",
